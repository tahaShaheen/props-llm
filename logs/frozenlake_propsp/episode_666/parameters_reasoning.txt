You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I need to come up with a new policy for the FrozenLake environment that hasn't been tried before and could potentially improve the reward. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward, which should ideally be around 1.0.

Looking at the previous policies provided, they all have f(params) values ranging from 0.35 down to 0.00. Since these are below 1.0, I'm in "Explorer" mode, meaning I need to propose a new configuration that's distinct from what's been tried so far.

First, let me understand the environment better. The grid is 4x4 with state numbers 0-15. Holes are present, and the agent can slip when moving. The optimal policy should navigate towards state 15 without falling into any holes.

In previous policies, many of the params were set to 3 or 2. For example, in the first top-performing param, params[0] was 1, and others varied between 0, 1, 2, 3. To explore new territories, I should vary these actions more widely but also ensure that the agent isn't getting stuck or falling into holes.

I notice that in some cases, moving down (action 0) might be risky because of the slippery nature. Alternatively, certain states might have high risks if specific actions are taken due to proximity to holes.

Let me consider each state and decide on an action that could lead towards the goal while avoiding known problematic paths. For instance:

- State 0: Top-left corner. Maybe moving right (action 1) or down (action 0). But considering the slippery nature, if I choose right, it might sometimes go left or down. Hmm.

Wait, but since the agent's actions are probabilistic, maybe choosing an action that has a higher chance of moving towards the goal would be better.

Alternatively, perhaps setting some states to stay in place could help avoid holes, but that might not lead towards the goal either.

Looking at the trajectories provided, some ended quickly because they fell into holes. So I need to make sure each state's action choice doesn't have a high probability of leading to a hole.

For example, if a certain state has a high chance of moving to a hole regardless of the action chosen, perhaps choosing an action that minimizes this risk is better, even if it means taking longer paths.

I think I should go through each state and assign actions that balance movement towards the goal while avoiding risky transitions. Maybe prioritizing right and down movements, but adjusting based on the state's position relative to the goal.

Let me start from state 15 (the goal) and work backwards. Since it's the terminal state, no action is needed. For other states, I need to assign actions that guide towards 15 without leading into holes.

For instance:

- State 14: If the agent takes an action that can move up, right, or down (action 3), but since 14 is in row 3, column 2, moving right would reach state 15. So setting params[14] to 3 might be good because it has a chance to move right.

- State 10: It's in row 2, column 2. Moving down (action 0) could take it to state 14 or other states. But since slipping can send it elsewhere, maybe choosing an action that has the highest probability of moving towards the goal is better.

Wait, perhaps instead of trying to map each state individually, I should consider a general strategy where from any state, the agent tries to move right or down as much as possible, but with some flexibility due to the slippery nature.

But since each action leads to three possible directions equally, it's tricky. So maybe setting actions that have a higher chance of moving towards the goal would be better.

Alternatively, perhaps using a greedy approach where each state moves towards the nearest unvisited state in the direction of the goal.

Another thought: Since the agent can end up anywhere when slipping, ensuring that from each state, at least one of the possible directions leads to a safe path is crucial. So maybe assigning actions that cover multiple paths could help avoid holes.

I think I need to create a policy where most states push towards moving right or down but also have some flexibility in case of slips. Maybe alternating between these actions across different states.

Looking at previous policies, they often set several states to action 3. Let me try varying this by setting some states to other actions, like 2 or 0, to see if that leads to a better path.

For example:

- Set state 0 to action 1 (right), which would have a chance to move down or left as well.
- State 1: Maybe action 3 (which includes right, up, and down). This could help in moving towards the goal or avoiding holes by having multiple options.
- Similarly, for other states, assign actions that cover different movement directions.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe focusing on specific patterns would be better. Let me try to come up with a new set of params where each state's action is chosen differently from previous top-performing policies.

I'll go through each state and choose an action, trying to avoid repeating the same actions as before. For example:

- State 0: Previous top policy used 1. I'll change it to 2.
- State 1: Previous was 3; I'll try 1.
- State 2: Previous was 1; maybe 3 now.
- And so on, ensuring each state's action is different from the most recent policies.

But wait, without knowing where the holes are exactly, it's hard to ensure safety. Maybe a better approach is to have actions that generally move towards the goal but also explore other directions to find safe paths.

Alternatively, perhaps setting some states to stay in place could help avoid risky moves, but that might not contribute to reaching the goal.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. I think I'll try to create a new policy where each state's action is set to 2 or 3, which have different movement combinations, and see if that leads to a better reward.
