You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the environment is a 4x4 grid where each cell can be in states 0 to 15. The agent moves around, but because of the slippery nature, each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability. The goal is state 15, which gives +1 reward, and there are holes that end the episode if stepped on.

The policy is a list of actions for each state (0-15). Each entry can be 0-3, corresponding to up, right, down, left. Wait, actually, according to the problem statement:

- Action 0: move down, left, up.
- Action 1: move right, down, left.
- Action 2: move up, right, down.
- Action 3: move left, up, right.

Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Each action leads to three possible moves, each with equal chance (1/3). So the agent doesn't always go in one direction when taking an action; instead, it has some randomness in movement.

The goal is to reach state 15 (bottom-right corner) and avoid holes. The optimal policy should aim for a reward close to 1.0, meaning it's successfully reaching the goal often.

Looking at the provided data, the top-performing policies have rewards around 0.35-0.45. That's not too high, so we need to explore more.

The recent attempts show that some policies are getting stuck or falling into holes. For example, one trajectory went (0,1) and then got stuck moving down, left, etc., without reaching the goal. Another fell into a hole immediately after moving from state 0.

To maximize information gain, I should suggest a policy that explores new areas. Maybe changing some of the initial states' actions to try different paths.

Looking at the most recent policies, many have params[0] set to 2 or 1. Let's see: in state 0 (top-left), taking action 2 would lead to moves up, right, down. But since it's already on top row, moving up isn't possible—so effectively, it could go right or down with higher probability. Alternatively, action 3 might be better for exploring different directions.

Wait, but the environment is slippery, so each action leads to three possible moves, not just one. So in state 0 (top-left), taking action 2 would have a 1/3 chance of moving up (which isn't possible—so stays?), right, or down. But I think in practice, moving outside the grid wraps around? Or does it stay? The problem statement doesn't specify, but I'll assume that moving out of bounds either stays or perhaps is considered as not moving, which could be problematic.

Alternatively, maybe action 1 for state 0 would lead to right, down, left. So from (0,0), right goes to (0,1), down goes to (4), and left might stay or wrap around? Not sure. But the key is that each action gives multiple movement options.

Given that, perhaps setting params[0] to 2 could lead the agent to try moving right more often than not, as one of the three possible moves when taking action 2 from state 0 is right. Similarly, other states might benefit from different actions based on their position relative to the goal and holes.

Looking at the trajectories, some agents are getting stuck in loops or falling into holes quickly. So I need to adjust policies to avoid such outcomes.

For example, in state 15 (goal), it's already done, so no action needed. But for other states near the edges or holes, careful selection is crucial.

I think a good strategy is to set actions that push towards the goal more and minimize the chances of falling into holes. So, perhaps in states closer to the bottom-right, actions that tend to move right or down would be better, but considering the slipperiness, it's about increasing the probability of moving towards the goal.

So for each state, I need to choose an action that gives the highest chance of eventually reaching the goal without falling into a hole. Since we can't remember previous attempts, I should propose parameters that explore different paths or slightly tweak the best-performing ones.

Looking at the top params, most have params[0] as 1 or 2. Let me try changing some to see if it improves.

Proposing a new set of params where for states near the top-left and other critical areas, actions are varied to explore more paths. Maybe setting params[0] to 3 (action 3), which from state 0 would have a chance to move left, up, or right. But moving left from 0 might not be possible, so it could either stay or wrap around. Alternatively, action 1 might be better for exploring right and down.

I think the key is to vary the actions in such a way that the agent can explore different paths without getting stuck or falling into holes quickly. So perhaps changing some of the initial states' actions to see if they lead to better exploration.

Let me propose a new set where for state 0, I choose action 1, which would allow moving right (to state 1), down (state 4), or left (maybe stay in 0). This could help in exploring both right and down directions. Similarly, adjusting other states' actions to balance between exploration and exploitation.

After considering all this, I'll propose a new set of params that slightly vary from the previous top-performing ones, focusing on states where current policies aren't performing well.
