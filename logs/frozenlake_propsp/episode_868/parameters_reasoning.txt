You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the globally optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward by getting to state 15 without falling into any holes. Let me think through how to approach this.

First, understanding the environment: It's a 4x4 grid with states numbered from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). Actions are taken in such a way that each action has three possible outcomes with equal probability due to the slippery nature of the ice. The challenge is figuring out which actions lead towards the goal without stepping into holes.

Looking at the provided data, the current best policies have rewards around 0.45, which is below the target of 1.0. This suggests that we're not yet optimal and need to explore more.

The most recent parameters tried are showing varying trajectories but none reaching the goal consistently. For example, some trajectories end quickly by falling into holes or not moving towards the goal effectively. 

I notice that in the top-performing params, certain states have specific actions. For instance, state 0 (top-left) often has action 1 or 2, which might move it towards the right or down. However, without knowing the hole positions, it's tricky to decide the best path.

Since the environment is slippery and the agent can't remember past attempts, each policy must be self-contained. To maximize information gain, I should propose a new set of params that tests different paths or avoids previously problematic states.

I think setting up actions that generally move towards the goal (right and down) might help. For example, in state 0, moving right could take it closer to state 3, which is also on the top row but further along. But considering the slippery nature, I should choose actions that have a higher chance of eventually reaching the goal without getting stuck.

Looking at previous attempts, some params have high action values (like 2 or 3), which might indicate more varied movement directions. Maybe trying to make certain states consistently move towards specific directions would help.

Another approach is to ensure that when the agent is near the goal, it takes actions that maximize the chance of reaching state 15 without falling into a hole. For instance, in state 14 (third row, third column), moving right should take it to state 15 if possible.

I also need to avoid repeating params that have already been tried. The system is stateless, so each suggestion must be unique and designed to explore new possibilities.

After considering all this, I'll draft a set of params where most states nudge the agent towards the right or down directions, with occasional variations to handle the slippery nature and potential holes.
