You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to find the optimal policy for a 4x4 FrozenLake environment where each move has a 33% chance to go in one of three directions due to slipperiness. The agent needs to reach state 15 (bottom-right corner) to get a reward of +1, while all other states give 0. Holes are present which end the episode if stepped on.

First, I need to understand the structure of the environment and the movement mechanics. The grid is 4x4 with states numbered from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). Actions correspond to directions, but due to slipperiness, each action leads to a 3-way split in possible moves.

Looking at the example policies provided, it seems that some strategies are being tested. For instance, policies often try moving towards the goal while avoiding holes. The trajectories show loops and sometimes getting stuck, indicating that certain paths might lead to holes or inefficiencies.

The recent parameters tried include mixing actions like 1,2,3 in various states, but their rewards are low (0.25 on average). To improve, I should focus on policies that have a higher chance of reaching the goal without falling into holes.

I remember that in such environments, optimal policies often involve moving right and down towards the goal. However, due to slipperiness, it's essential to choose actions that maximize the probability of getting closer while minimizing the risk of hitting a hole.

Looking at state 0 (top-left), action 1 (which can move right, down, or left) might be better than action 2, as moving right is more direct towards the goal. Similarly, in other states, choosing actions that push towards the goal with minimal risk is key.

I need to propose a new set of parameters that haven't been tried before and could potentially yield higher rewards. Let me draft a policy where each state is mapped to an action that either moves directly towards the goal or minimizes the chance of hitting a hole based on known positions.

For example, in state 0, choosing action 1 (which can move right with some probability) might be better than other actions. In states closer to the goal, prioritize actions that go straight towards it. Avoiding holes requires knowing their locations, which are not explicitly given but can be inferred from previous trajectories where agents fell into them.

After considering all this, I'll propose a new set of params where each state is assigned an action that either moves towards the goal or avoids known hole positions based on prior attempts.
