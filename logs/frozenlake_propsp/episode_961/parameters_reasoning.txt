You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy parameters for this FrozenLake environment. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The environment is a 4x4 grid where the agent can move in four directions: left, down, right, up. Each state (from 0 to 15) represents the agent's position on the grid. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) for a reward of +1. All other states give 0, except if the agent steps into a hole, which ends the episode.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 elements (params[0] to params[15]), where each element indicates the action to take in that state. The possible actions are 0,1,2,3, each corresponding to different movement options with equal probabilities among three directions.

Given that the environment is slippery, taking an action doesn't guarantee moving in the intended direction. Instead, the agent has a 1/3 chance of moving in one of three possible directions depending on the action chosen. For example, choosing action 0 (left) could result in down, left, or up with equal probability.

The task is to find the optimal policy that maximizes the average reward over 20 episodes. The user has provided some previous attempts and their corresponding rewards, as well as trajectories showing how the agent moves under each policy.

Looking at the history, the best performing policies have rewards around 0.35-0.45, which is much lower than the target of 1.0. This suggests that we're still in the exploration phase since the rewards aren't close to optimal yet.

Since I'm supposed to act as a stateless optimizer and maximize information gain, I need to propose a new set of params that's different from previous attempts and could potentially lead to higher rewards. The idea is to explore new configurations rather than tweak existing ones because we're not near the target reward yet.

I notice that in some previous policies, certain states (like 0) were assigned action 1 or 2. Maybe trying a different action for state 0 could help reach the goal faster. Alternatively, perhaps other states are being mishandled, causing the agent to get stuck or fall into holes more often than necessary.

I should consider which states are crucial for reaching the goal and ensure that their actions guide the agent towards state 15 without hitting any holes. For example, states near the edges (like 0, 3, 12) might need careful handling because moving off the grid could lead to a hole or not.

Maybe I can try setting some of the initial states to move right or down more often to head towards state 15 directly. However, considering the slippery nature, I have to choose actions that statistically increase the chances of moving in the desired direction without getting stuck.

I'll think about the trajectories provided. For example, one trajectory went from (0,1) to (4,2) and then to (8,2). That suggests that perhaps action 2 is leading the agent down, but maybe another action would be better for certain states.

Another thing to note is that if the policy gets stuck in a loop or keeps moving away from the goal, it's not effective. So I need to ensure that each state's action choice leads towards the goal without creating cycles.

Given all this, perhaps adjusting some of the initial states (like 0,1,2,3) to different actions could help. Maybe try setting params[0] to 1 or 2 instead of previous values to see if it changes the trajectory positively.

Wait, in some earlier attempts, params[0] was set to 1 or 2. Let me check if changing other states might have a bigger impact. For instance, state 7 is near the goal; perhaps ensuring that from there, the agent moves right or down more often could help reach the goal.

Alternatively, maybe focusing on avoiding holes by adjusting actions in states adjacent to them would be beneficial. For example, if moving left from a certain state leads to a hole, then the action should encourage other directions.

I think I need to propose a new set of params that tries different actions, especially in the early states and those near the goal, to see how they affect the trajectory and reward. Since previous rewards are low, this suggests that the current policies aren't efficient enough, so changing multiple parameters might yield better results.

After considering all these factors, I'll construct a new params array where several key states have different actions from previous attempts, focusing on moving towards the goal while avoiding potential holes.
