You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward by reaching state 15, which gives +1. All other states give 0, except for the holes which end the episode.

First, I need to understand the environment better. It's a 4x4 grid with slippery movements. Each action taken has three possible outcomes in different directions with equal probability. The agent can't control exactly where it goes when it takes an action; it just influences the direction probabilistically.

The policy is defined by params[0] to params[15], each indicating the action (0-3) for that state. My task is to propose these parameters in a way that maximizes the reward, considering the slippery nature and the holes.

Looking at the provided data, the best performing policies have rewards around 0.45, which is quite low since the goal is to reach 1.0. This suggests that current strategies aren't effectively navigating towards state 15 without falling into holes or getting stuck in loops.

The recent parameters tried include various combinations, but they all seem to result in trajectories that either loop endlessly or get stuck near the top-left area. For example, one trajectory goes from (0,3) to (0,3) multiple times, which is likely a hole since it's not moving towards state 15.

I think the key issue might be that the current policies aren't effectively leading the agent towards the goal state 15 while avoiding holes. Maybe the agent isn't being directed right or down enough, especially from states near the top-left.

To improve this, I should consider actions that push the agent more towards the bottom-right. For instance, in the initial states (like 0, which is top-left), choosing actions that have a higher chance of moving down or right might help. Also, ensuring that the policy avoids leading the agent into known hole positions.

Since the environment is slippery, it's essential to choose actions that, on average, move the agent closer to state 15. For example, from state 0 (top-left), action 2 (which can move up, right, or down) might help because moving right could take the agent towards the goal, even though there's a chance it could go up or down.

I should also look at the structure of the grid and identify which states are holes. From the trajectories provided, I notice that some paths end quickly, indicating possible holes. For example, state 0 might be a hole because one trajectory stays there multiple times. However, without explicit knowledge of which states are holes, it's challenging to design the policy around them.

Given that, my strategy is to propose a new set of parameters that encourages movement towards the goal while exploring different paths to avoid getting stuck or falling into holes. Since current policies aren't performing well, I should focus on exploration rather than exploitation, trying distinct configurations to gather more information about which actions lead closer to the goal.

I'll suggest modifying some key states' actions to push the agent more towards state 15. For example, in states near the top-left, choosing actions that have a higher probability of moving down or right. Additionally, I'll ensure that from each state, the chosen action has a path that could eventually lead to state 15 without getting stuck.

Finally, considering the need to maximize information gain and avoid previously seen parameters, I'll create a new set of params where certain key states have their actions changed to encourage movement towards the goal. This way, even if the current reward isn't high, it might provide insights into better paths for future iterations.
