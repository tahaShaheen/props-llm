You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I need to help find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me start by understanding the problem thoroughly.

The environment is a 4x4 grid with states numbered from 0 to 15. The goal is state 15, which gives a reward of +1. All other states give 0. There are holes in some grids that end the episode if the agent steps on them. The slippery nature means each action leads to one of three directions with equal probability.

The policy is defined by an array params of length 16, where each element is an action (0-3). My job is to propose such a params array that optimizes the episodic reward.

Looking at the provided information:

- The top 5 best-performing params have f(params) around 0.45 or lower.
- The most recent policies are performing very poorly, with some giving 0.10 and even 0.00 rewards.
- The goal is to reach a global optimal reward of around 1.0.

Since the current top performer isn't close to 1.0, I should focus on exploration. My strategy should be to propose new params that haven't been tried before and could potentially avoid holes while moving towards state 15.

Let me think about how each action affects movement considering the slippery nature:

- Action 0: down, left, up
- Action 1: right, down, left
- Action 2: up, right, down
- Action 3: left, up, right

Each action gives a 1/3 chance to three directions. To reach state 15 (bottom-right), the agent should generally move right or down. However, because of the slipperiness, choosing actions that have a higher probability of moving towards the goal might be better.

Looking at each state:

- Start at 0: top-left corner. From here, to get closer to 15, moving right (action 1) or down (action 0). Since action 1 can move right with 1/3 chance, and also has a chance to go down or left.

Wait, but since the environment is slippery, each action leads to three possible directions. So, for example, if I'm at state 0 and take action 1, there's a 1/3 chance to go right (to state 1), 1/3 chance to go down (state 4), and 1/3 chance to go left (which is invalid as it would wrap around or stay? Wait, in FrozenLake, moving left from state 0 might lead back to state 7 (if using the standard slippery version). Hmm, I need to clarify the movement.

Wait, in the description:

- For each action, the agent moves in one of three directions with equal probability. So, for example, if in state 0 and take action 0 (down), it can go down, left, or up.

But state 0 is top-left corner. Down from 0 would be state 4, left might not exist as it's the edge—so perhaps it wraps around? Or stays? Wait, no, in FrozenLake, moving beyond the grid probably leads to staying in place or being clamped. Hmm, this could vary.

Wait, maybe I should map out all possible transitions for each action and state. That would help me figure out which actions are safe and lead towards the goal without hitting holes.

But since I don't have the exact hole positions, I need to infer them based on trajectories where agents fell into holes.

Looking at the provided trajectories:

- The first top param's trajectory ends with (14,2) leading to f(params):0.45. That suggests that state 14 is a safe state but didn't reach the goal.
- Another trajectory in the most recent params had (6,1) as a terminal point, which might be a hole.

Wait, no, actually, the trajectories show where the agent went before ending. So if an agent steps on a hole, the episode ends there.

From the examples:

- Trajectory: (0,3) (0,3)...(14,2). Maybe state 14 is not a hole because it continued.
- Another trajectory had (6,1), which led to ending. So perhaps state 6 or 1 is a hole?

Wait, looking at the example trajectories:

In the first top param's trajectory: (0,3) leads to (0,3) multiple times, then (1,2), (2,0), etc., reaching (14,2). The agent didn't fall into a hole here.

Another example had (0,1) leading to (0,1)...(4,1), which might not be a hole. But another trajectory had (0,1) leading to (1,3), then (2,1), etc., but still ended without falling.

Wait, perhaps the holes are in certain states. Maybe I can identify them from the trajectories where agents fell into them.

Looking at the most recent params:

- One policy got 0.00 reward with a trajectory ending at (0,2) repeatedly. So maybe state 0 is not a hole.
- Another trajectory had (0,1) leading to (1,1), which then led to (2,2), but ended there without falling.

Wait, perhaps the holes are in certain states like 5, 6, etc., but I'm not sure. Without exact hole positions, it's tricky. So maybe the best approach is to design a policy that avoids getting stuck and moves towards the goal.

Given that, let me think about which actions would generally move towards state 15.

For example:

- From state 0 (top-left), taking action 1 (right) gives a chance to go right (state 1), down (4), or left (7). So, moving right is the desired direction.
- Similarly, from other states, choosing actions that have a high probability of moving towards the goal.

But considering the slippery nature, perhaps it's better to choose actions that maximize the chances of moving in the correct direction. For example:

- Right and down are the primary directions needed to reach state 15.

Looking at each action:

- Action 0: moves down, left, up.
- Action 1: right, down, left.
- Action 2: up, right, down.
- Action 3: left, up, right.

So, actions 1 and 2 include moving right or down, which are desirable. Actions 0 and 3 may have less favorable directions.

Perhaps setting most states to choose between action 1 and 2 would help. For example:

- States closer to the goal might choose action 1 (to go right) if possible.
- States that need to move down might take action 2 or 0.

But without knowing where the holes are, it's risky. Maybe some states should avoid certain actions to prevent falling into holes.

Looking at the recent policies with low rewards, perhaps their params led the agent into holes. So I need a new policy that avoids those paths.

Maybe I can try setting all states to action 3, which includes left, up, and right movements. But since moving left or up might take them away from the goal, this could be bad. Alternatively, maybe action 1 is better for some states.

Alternatively, perhaps using a combination of actions that have a higher chance of moving towards the goal without stepping into known dangerous areas.

Wait, considering that in the top params, some are taking action 0 and others are taking 1 or 2. Maybe I can try varying the actions to see different paths.

But since I need to propose a new set of params, perhaps trying a different combination for each state could help explore new trajectories.

Let me consider creating a policy where each state has a mix of right and down movements. For example:

- Even-numbered states take action 1 (right, down, left).
- Odd-numbered states take action 2 (up, right, down).

This way, the agent alternates between trying to move right and down depending on the state.

Alternatively, maybe setting a specific pattern, like all states take action 3 except for certain key positions. But without knowing where the holes are, it's hard to say.

Another approach is to make sure that from each state, there's at least one action that leads towards the goal without hitting a hole. For example, if in state i, choosing an action that has a high probability of moving right or down.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each node (state) has transitions based on actions and their probabilities. Then, find a policy that maximizes the expected reward by avoiding holes.

But without knowing the hole positions, it's challenging to create an optimal path. So maybe focusing on creating a general movement towards the goal while varying actions to avoid previously tried policies is better.

Looking back at the top 5 params:

They all have a certain pattern: some states take action 1 or 3, others take 0 or 2. To explore new territory, I should change several of these to different actions not seen before.

For example, if in the previous best param, state 0 took action 1, maybe now set it to action 2. Similarly, vary other states' actions to see new trajectories and learn more about where the holes are or how to reach the goal better.

Alternatively, since all top params have a reward around 0.45, which is below the desired 1.0, I should try policies that explore different paths, perhaps taking more risks to find higher reward paths.

Perhaps setting some states to action 3 (which includes left and right) could allow for more lateral movement, potentially finding new routes that avoid holes and reach state 15.

I'll need to propose a params array where each element is from [0-3], making sure it's different from previous ones, especially the top 5. Let me try creating a new set:

params[0] = 2 (action 2: up, right, down) for state 0.
params[1] = 1 (action 1: right, down, left).
params[2] = 3 (action 3: left, up, right).
params[3] = 1 (action 1: right, down, left).
... and so on, varying each state's action to explore new paths.

But without knowing the exact hole positions, it's a bit of a shot in the dark. However, by varying actions, we can gather more data about which states are safe and which lead to holes or towards the goal.
