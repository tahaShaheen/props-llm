You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with the highest reward, but there are holes that can end the episode if stepped on. The policy is an array of 16 actions, each corresponding to a state from 0 to 15.

First, I need to understand how the slippery environment affects movement. Each action has three possible outcomes, so the agent's actual path isn't straightforward. This means that even if the intended action is correct, there's a chance it might not lead directly to the goal or could fall into a hole due to the randomness.

Looking at the top 4 best-performing params provided earlier, all of them have f(params) around 0.10. That's quite low, so maybe the agent isn't getting close to the goal often. The trajectories show that some are reaching state 8 or 4 but not proceeding further, indicating potential issues in navigation.

The most recent params also aren't performing well, with f(params) at 0.00 and trajectories that seem stuck or looping, like (0,3) repeating multiple times or getting stuck in certain states. This suggests that the current policies are leading to either loops or not progressing towards state 15 effectively.

Since the global optimal reward should be around 1.0, which means reaching the goal consistently, I need to design a policy that navigates effectively despite the slippery nature. It's crucial for each state to choose an action that maximizes the chance of moving closer to state 15 while avoiding holes.

I remember from standard FrozenLake solutions that greedy policies towards the goal are often effective because they directly move right or down when possible, considering the grid layout. However, in this slippery environment, such a direct approach might not work due to the movement probabilities.

Perhaps I should consider actions that generally point towards the goal but also account for the possibility of drifting. For example, states near the bottom-right (like 12,13,14,15) should have actions that try to move right or down as much as possible, even though there's a chance they might drift elsewhere.

I also need to identify which states are holes and ensure that the policy avoids them. Since the exact locations of the holes aren't specified, I have to infer based on trajectories provided. From the top params, when the agent is in state 0 (top-left), choosing action 1 leads towards moving down or right or left with equal probability. This might be a good start because it's pushing towards the goal.

Looking at recent attempts, some policies are getting stuck in loops or not progressing. To break this, maybe I should vary the actions more across different states to explore alternative paths and avoid cycles.

I think the key is to have each state point towards the direction that would eventually lead to the goal if given multiple steps. So, for each state, choose an action that has a high probability of moving closer over time, considering the 3-way split in movement directions.

For instance:
- States on the top row (0-3) should prefer actions that move down.
- Middle rows should encourage right or down movements.
- The last row and rightmost column should focus on moving right or up/down as needed to reach state 15 without hitting holes.

I'll try setting states closer to the goal to choose actions that push towards state 15, while earlier states aim to move down or right. I need to make sure that even with the slippery nature, over time, the agent can navigate towards the goal.

Given all this, I'll propose a new set of params where each state is mapped to an action that directs towards the goal. For example:
- State 0: Move right (action 1) to go towards state 1 or down.
- States in the top row (0-3): Actions that generally move down or right.
- Middle states: Actions that push towards the bottom-right.

I'll check if this new configuration has been tried before. If not, it's worth testing as it could lead to better rewards.
