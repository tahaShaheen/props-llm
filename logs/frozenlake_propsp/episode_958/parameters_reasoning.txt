You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to maximize the reward by getting the agent to state 15 without falling into any holes. From the problem description, I know that each action taken has a 33% chance of moving in three different directions due to the slippery nature of the environment.

Looking at the top-performing params provided earlier, most of them have an average reward around 0.35-0.45. That's significantly below the target of 1.0, which suggests that there's a lot of room for improvement. The agent isn't consistently reaching the goal and is probably falling into holes or getting stuck in loops.

I notice that the trajectories show the agent sometimes taking actions that lead to dead-ends or revisiting states multiple times, like (0,3) leading to (1,3), which might be a hole. So, I need to design a policy that avoids these problematic transitions.

One approach is to make sure that from each state, the agent has a higher probability of moving towards the goal (state 15). Since the environment is slippery, the actions should be chosen such that even with the possible drifts, the agent still has a path towards the goal.

For example, in the top-left corner (state 0), choosing action 2 (which can move up, right, or down) might help the agent head towards state 1 or 4. Similarly, in other states near the edges, selecting actions that push towards the center or the goal would be beneficial.

I also need to consider avoiding holes by ensuring that certain high-risk states have actions that don't lead into them. For instance, if a hole is at state 5, then from neighboring states like 1, 4, etc., the agent should avoid taking actions that might land it on 5.

To test this, I'll try modifying some of the params to encourage movement towards the goal while avoiding known holes. Maybe setting certain states to always move right or down when possible could increase the chances of reaching state 15 without falling into traps.

Given that in the recent trials, the agent often gets stuck in loops or doesn't make progress, perhaps a more aggressive policy is needed. This might involve actions that have a higher chance of moving towards the goal even if there's some randomness.

I'll structure my next params to prioritize right and down movements from states that are closer to the goal, while ensuring that other states don't lead into holes. For example:

- From state 0 (top-left), choose action 2 (up, right, or down). This allows a chance to move right towards state 1.
- From state 14 (third row, third column), choosing action 3 might help in moving right to reach the goal.

I'll also make sure that states near the bottom-right corner have actions that push directly towards the goal. For instance, state 12 could be set to move up or right, and so on.

By carefully selecting each action based on proximity to the goal and avoiding known holes, I hope to create a policy that can achieve the maximum reward of 1.0 by consistently reaching state 15 without falling into any traps.
