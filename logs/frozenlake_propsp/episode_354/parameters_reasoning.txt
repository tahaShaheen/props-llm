You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help the agent find the best policy in this FrozenLake environment with slippery conditions and holes that require exploration. The goal is to reach state 15, which is the bottom right corner. 

First, I understand that the policy is a function represented by params[0] to params[3], each being an action when the state corresponds to 0-15 (top-left to bottom-right). Each action is one of 0-3, representing left, down, up, or right.

The environment has slippery conditions: each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability. So, for example, taking action 0 might go left, but with 2/3 chance, it will randomly choose between down and up. Similarly, other actions also have this behavior except that when the agent is on certain positions (like state 0), one of their actions leads to an impossible outcome.

The hole in the map means that once the agent steps on a hole, the game ends, and we need to explore by revisiting previous states. The policy should avoid falling into these holes by exploring nearby regions.

I've seen some example params where certain actions are taken when in specific states. For instance, taking action 2 (up) is preferred in state 0 because it leads to more positive outcomes without hitting a hole. This suggests that the optimal policy tends to take up moves when possible.

The current reward function f(params) increases as better policies are found but sometimes plateaus or even decreases slightly due to exploration. The agent needs enough exploration to find better paths, especially in areas with holes.

Considering the slippery conditions, the agent's decision-making is influenced by avoiding immediate losses while trying to maximize future rewards. So, when faced with a hole, it should prefer moving in directions that lead back into previously visited regions or avoid being stuck in worse states.

I also note that some params have actions set to 0 (left) and others to higher numbers like 3 (right). In the examples given, taking right action at state 15 is optimal, as it's a goal. So, perhaps the best policy prioritizes reaching the goal while exploring surrounding areas when necessary.

Since each param value affects future states equally due to slippery conditions, it's crucial to balance exploitation and exploration. Exploitation would be sticking close to known good paths, but since the environment is slippery, sometimes more random moves might lead to better overall outcomes.

I need to find params that encourage moving towards state 15 while avoiding holes. Maybe using higher action numbers (like 2 or 3) when possible but ensuring that exploration doesn't lead to immediate penalties.

Also, considering the hole at states like 4-7 and 9-11, which are on the right side, the agent should not step into these areas unless necessary for better paths. So, it's probably best to move left or down from these states when possible.

In summary, the optimal policy likely tries to explore neighboring regions while trying to reach state 15 efficiently, avoiding holes by leveraging slippery movements and re-exploring when stuck.
