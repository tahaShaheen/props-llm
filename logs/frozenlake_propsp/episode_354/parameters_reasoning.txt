You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy parameters for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get the highest reward by reaching state 15, which gives +1, while avoiding holes that end the episode with 0 reward.

First, I need to understand how the environment works. It's a 4x4 grid, so states are from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). The agent can move in four directions, but because it's slippery, each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability. That adds a lot of uncertainty.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 values, each being 0-3, indicating the action for each state. My task is to find the optimal params that maximize the average reward over 20 episodes.

Looking at the problem statement, I see that the agent's actions are stochastic because of the slippery nature. So, even if the policy suggests a certain action, there's a chance it might move in another direction. This means the policy needs to be robust enough to handle these uncertainties and still navigate towards the goal safely.

From the examples provided, I notice that some policies have lower rewards (like 0.15) while others are around 0.25. The top-performing ones seem to have a mix of actions that might be guiding the agent closer to the goal without falling into holes.

I also see that the recent attempts have had low rewards, like 0.05 and even 0.00. That suggests we're still in an exploration phase, trying different policies to find one that works well. Since the global optimal is around 1.0, which means success every time, I need to get closer to that.

Given that each action choice leads to multiple possible moves, it's crucial for the policy to guide the agent towards states that have a higher chance of leading to the goal without stepping on holes. So, maybe the best approach is to structure the policy so that from certain key positions, actions are chosen to maximize the probability of moving towards the goal.

Looking at state 15, which is the goal, it should probably stay there if reached, but in this setup, once you reach 15, the episode ends. So for all other states, we need to move towards 15 without hitting any holes.

I think I should look at each state and determine which action would give the highest chance of moving closer to 15 while avoiding known holes. Since it's a grid, perhaps moving right or down is more beneficial in certain areas. But due to the slipperiness, we need to account for all possible moves when choosing the policy.

I also notice that previous policies have been trying various combinations but haven't hit the optimal yet. So maybe I should adjust some key states' actions to see if that leads to better performance.

For example, in state 0 (top-left), action 1 or 2 might help move towards the goal, considering the possible moves. Similarly, for other starting states, choosing actions that have a high probability of moving towards the center or the goal area could be beneficial.

But without knowing which states are holes, I need to infer based on trajectories. If an agent keeps falling into certain states, those must be holes. From the recent attempts, I see trajectories like (0,3) leading to some states but not reaching 15, suggesting that maybe some of these paths lead to holes.

So, perhaps I should adjust the policy for key states like 0, 4, 8, etc., to take actions that have a higher chance of moving towards the goal without hitting those problematic areas.

I think it's time to propose a new set of parameters. Maybe by tweaking some of the most recent ones but making sure they haven't been tried before and cover different paths.
