You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy parameters for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to maximize the reward by reaching state 15, which gives +1, while avoiding holes that end the episode. 

First, I need to understand the setup. It's a 4x4 grid where each state corresponds to a position (0-15). Actions are slippery, meaning taking an action could lead to one of three possible moves with equal probability. For example, action 0 can move down, left, or up.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 values, each from [0,1,2,3], indicating the action for each state. My task is to propose a new set of parameters that haven't been tried before and could potentially improve the reward.

Looking at the history provided, most policies are yielding around 0.35-0.45 average rewards over 20 episodes. The best performing one got 0.45, but the optimal should be around 1.0, so there's room for improvement.

I notice that in the recent trials, some parameters have been tried multiple times with low rewards. For example, params[0] was often set to 1 or 2, leading to trajectories that didn't reach the goal quickly and sometimes fell into holes.

Since I need to maximize information gain, I should try a policy that explores new territories rather than tweaking existing ones since the current rewards are below 1.0, making me an "Explorer."

I think focusing on states near the goal might help. For instance, state 14 is adjacent to 15, so setting params[14] to move right or up could be beneficial. Similarly, state 12 (bottom-left) should probably move right.

Let's consider each state:

- Start at 0: moving right (action 1) might lead towards the goal faster.
- State 1: maybe down to go to 5.
- States near the bottom row should aim to move right or up towards the goal.
- Avoiding holes is crucial, so actions should be chosen to minimize risk.

I'll try setting params[0] to 3 (action 3), which could help explore different paths. For state 14, set action 2 to move up, which would take it to 15 if successful. Similarly, state 13 should aim right or down, but since moving right leads to the goal, perhaps action 2.

I'll randomly assign other states with a focus on moving towards higher-numbered states (right and down) to reach 15 as quickly as possible, while avoiding holes by not going left or up when it's risky.
