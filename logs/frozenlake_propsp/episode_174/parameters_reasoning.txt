You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, let's break this down step by step. I'm trying to figure out the best policy for the FrozenLake environment to maximize the reward. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) with a +1 reward, avoiding holes along the way.

First, understanding the environment: it's a 4x4 grid where each cell represents a state from 0 to 15. The agent can move in four directions, but due to slipperiness, taking an action leads to one of three possible moves with equal probability. This adds uncertainty because the agent doesn't always end up where they intend.

Looking at the policy parameters (params), each value is an action (0-3) that the agent takes from a given state. The challenge is to set these actions so that the agent can navigate towards the goal without falling into any holes.

From the provided examples, most policies yield low rewards around 0.15 or lower. This suggests that the current strategies aren't effectively avoiding holes or reaching the goal consistently. My aim is to find a policy that achieves higher rewards, ideally approaching 1.0.

I notice that in previous attempts, many params have a repeating pattern, like alternating between actions. For example, some policies alternate between moving right and down. This might not be effective because of the slippery nature, leading to unpredictable paths.

To optimize, I should consider which states are most critical. The goal is state 15, so the agent needs a clear path from the starting point (state 0) to 15 without encountering holes. Since the environment is probabilistic, the policy must account for all possible outcomes of each action.

Perhaps setting up the policy to prioritize moving towards the right and down directions would be better since those are the general directions needed to reach state 15 from 0. But due to slipperiness, I need to ensure that even if the agent takes a different path, they still have a chance to reach the goal without falling into holes.

Looking at the most recent policies, some had actions that looped or didn't make progress towards the goal. To break this cycle, I should introduce more varied actions in certain states to encourage exploration and avoid getting stuck in loops.

One approach is to design the policy such that from each state, the agent has a higher probability of moving in the general direction of the goal while also having alternative paths if one direction leads into a hole. For example, from state 0 (top-left), choosing action 1 (which can lead right, down, or left) might be beneficial because moving right is towards the goal.

I should also analyze where the holes are located to ensure that the policy avoids them. Since the exact positions of the holes aren't specified, I need a general strategy that minimizes the risk of falling into any hole while maximizing the chance of reaching the goal.

Considering all this, I'll propose a new set of params where each state is assigned an action that primarily moves towards the right or down but also includes alternative directions to handle the slipperiness and avoid holes. This should create diverse trajectories, increasing the chances of finding a path to the goal without falling into traps.
