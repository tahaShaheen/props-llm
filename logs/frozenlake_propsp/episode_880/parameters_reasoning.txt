You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me start by understanding the problem thoroughly.

The environment is a 4x4 grid where the agent can move in four directions: left, down, right, and up. However, due to the slippery nature of the ice, each action doesn't always result in the intended movement. Instead, when an action is taken, the agent moves in one of three possible directions with equal probability. The goal is state 15 (the bottom-right corner), which gives a reward of +1, while all other states give 0. There are also holes that end the episode if stepped on.

The policy is represented by an array of 16 actions, each corresponding to a state from 0 to 15. The challenge is to find the optimal set of actions that maximizes the reward, avoiding holes and efficiently navigating towards the goal.

Looking at the top-performing params provided, they all have f(params) around 0.35-0.45. This suggests that there's room for improvement since the global optimal should be around 1.0. The trajectories show that some policies are reaching the goal but not consistently.

I notice that in the most recent attempts, several params lead to immediate falls into holes or long loops without reaching the goal. For instance, one trajectory goes from (0,3) through multiple states and eventually ends without success. Another gets stuck moving between states 4 and 8 without progress.

To improve, I need a policy that avoids these pitfalls and efficiently navigates towards state 15. Let me think about each state's optimal action.

Starting with state 0 (top-left corner), the best move is likely down or right since those are the main directions to explore. However, due to slippage, taking an action might not lead directly to the intended state. So, choosing actions that have a higher probability of moving towards the goal would be better.

For states near the edges, like state 3 (top-right), moving down or right could help avoid falling into holes below. Similarly, for state 12 (bottom-left), moving right is essential to reach the goal without getting stuck.

I should also consider how each action's possible movements affect safety. For example, in state 4 (second row, first column), choosing an action that moves towards the center or the goal while avoiding holes would be beneficial.

Given the previous attempts, perhaps adjusting certain states' actions could lead to better outcomes. Maybe some states are being too cautious, leading to loops instead of progressing towards the goal. Introducing more risky but rewarding actions might help achieve higher rewards.

Let me draft a possible set of params:

- For state 0: action 1 (right)
- State 1: action 3 (up or right or left) needs evaluation
Wait, no, each action corresponds to different movement probabilities. Maybe I should map out the best possible actions for each state that maximizes the chance of moving towards the goal without hitting holes.

Alternatively, since this is an iterative process and I can't remember previous attempts, I need to propose a new set of params that's distinct from what's been tried before but has potential to improve performance. Maybe changing some key states' actions could unlock better paths.

After considering these factors, here's a proposed params array where certain critical states are adjusted to encourage movement towards the goal while minimizing risk.
