You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out the best policy parameters for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right corner) and get a reward of +1. All other states give 0. The agent has slippery actions where each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability when taken.

I remember that in such environments, especially with the slipperiness, it's crucial to have a balance between exploration and exploitation. If the parameters are too fixed (like all ones), maybe the agent might get stuck or fail on holes, which is why some of the provided examples show lower rewards like 0.25 or even 0.

Looking at the parameters given in the top performing lists, I notice that they vary between 0 and 3. For instance, params[1] are mostly 1s but sometimes 3, suggesting a preference for right moves. This might help avoid falling into holes by choosing safe directions when possible.

But wait, how do these parameters affect the exploration? If all actions are deterministic (params[i]=2), the agent would always choose the same action, which could lead to getting stuck on holes or not exploring enough. However, using a mix of 0 and 3 allows for both following certain paths and branching out to explore other options.

I also think about the slipperiness rules: each action leads to three directions equally. So from any state, taking an action will move in one direction with higher probability, making it easy to get stuck if not careful. That's a problem because the goal is to reach the target without falling into holes. To overcome this, the policy should encourage movement towards the center and away from holes.

Maybe setting params[3] (which is for moving left) to 2 or 3 could help prevent immediate slipping in certain directions but allow exploration elsewhere. On the other hand, if params are too fixed, maybe it's better to have a mix of actions that allow the agent to both follow and explore effectively.

I should also consider the rewards. Since each action has a reward except for the goal state, which is +1. But since all other states give 0, I want to avoid getting stuck on any non-goal states. So perhaps adjusting params[i] to be higher when near the hole could encourage moving away from it.

Hmm, but without knowing the exact structure of the holes in the map, it's hard to set specific values for each state. The examples provided show that some parameters are 0 or 2, others are 1 or 3. Using a mix might be safer, as too many zeros could lead to more exploration being required.

I think the key is to have an array of actions that allows for both direction following and branching. For instance, using params like [2,3,1,2] would mean moving left with high probability but also exploring up or down. This should balance immediate exploration (to avoid falling) with overall goal progress.
