You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to help this user optimize the policy for the FrozenLake environment they've described. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. The environment is a 4x4 grid where the agent can move in four directions: up, down, left, right. But because the ice is slippery, each action leads to one of three possible moves with equal probability. The goal is state 15 (bottom-right corner), which gives +1 reward, while all others give 0. There are holes that end the episode if stepped on.

The user wants a global optimal policy, meaning a set of actions for each state that maximizes the average episodic reward. The policy is represented as an array 'params' where each element corresponds to an action (0-3) for each state (0-15).

From the interaction history, I see that after 940 iterations out of 5000, there have been several attempts with varying rewards between 0.0 and 0.45. The user's goal is to get as close to a reward of 1.0 as possible, which would mean reaching the goal every time.

Looking at the most recent parameters, I notice that many of them are leading to low or zero rewards. For example, in some cases, the agent gets stuck in loops or falls into holes. This suggests that the current policies aren't effectively navigating towards state 15 without hitting the holes.

I recall that in such grid environments with stochastic actions, a good strategy is to have each policy encourage movement towards the goal while avoiding dangerous states (holes). Since each action leads to three possible moves, the agent needs a policy that statistically increases its chances of moving towards the target while minimizing the risk of falling into holes.

Given that the user is in iteration 940 and hasn't reached close to 1.0 yet, it's likely that exploration is still needed. However, since some policies have shown moderate success (like 0.45), perhaps we're on the right track but need to refine certain states' actions.

I should consider how each state's policy choice affects the overall path. For instance, starting from state 0 (top-left corner), choosing an action that tends to move towards the right or down would be beneficial. Similarly, for other states near the edges or holes, specific actions might prevent falls and guide towards the goal.

Looking at the previous attempts, some trajectories end quickly because of hole landings. To avoid this, perhaps certain states should prefer actions that have a higher chance of moving away from known holes or towards the goal.

I think about each state individually:

- State 0 (top-left): Moving right (action 1) might be better to head towards the goal.
- States near the top and left edges need policies that avoid falling into adjacent holes.
- The states leading up to the goal should have actions that statistically push towards state 15.

I also consider that since each action leads to three possible moves, the optimal policy would be one where, on average, the agent progresses closer to the goal without stepping into holes. This might involve choosing actions that have a higher probability of moving in the desired direction and avoiding risky paths.

Given all this, I need to propose a new set of 'params' that differ from previous attempts but still aim for improvement. Maybe adjusting some states' actions to encourage more direct movement towards the goal while ensuring safety.
