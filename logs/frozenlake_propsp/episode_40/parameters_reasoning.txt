You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with the highest possible reward, which is +1 for that state and 0 otherwise. But there are some holes in the map that will make it difficult if we step on them, leading us to fall off.

The policy is represented by a function that maps each state (numbered from 0 to 15) to an action: left, right, up, or down. The parameters given initially are all set to 2, meaning the value of params[i] determines which action to take in state i. But these initial values might not be optimal because they're all set to the same value, and there could be better combinations that explore through the holes more effectively.

I remember from the problem statement that the policy should propose new parameters from [0, 1, 2, 3] for each of the 16 states. The goal is to find a combination where each action (0-3) corresponds correctly in each state without exploring too far if we end up on a hole.

I think about how the environment works: when an agent takes an action, it randomly selects among three options with equal probability if it's near a hole, or all four directions if it's not. So, if I choose actions that avoid known holes and allow exploration of new areas, I might discover paths through the holes.

Looking at the examples provided, some parameters lead to policies that efficiently explore surrounding states without getting stuck on holes. For instance, params[0] being 2 means when in state 0 (top-left), action 2 is chosen, which could be up or down due to equal probability. Then actions are explored further.

I should also consider the transitions: if I don't take an action, I stay in the same place unless it's a hole. But since we're avoiding holes by choosing specific actions, staying on non-hole states would lead us toward the goal.

Maybe a good approach is to balance exploration and exploitation. If all parameters are set uniformly (all 2), perhaps that's too exploitative and might not explore enough. So I should adjust some parameters to encourage more variation in action choices around known holes.

For example, if certain states near the hole have their actions set to different values, it could prevent getting stuck. Also, ensuring that all four directions are considered when possible can help discover paths through the holes without relying solely on one direction.

I think a promising strategy is to set params[0] (top-left) and params[15] (bottom-right hole) to 2 or 3 to avoid immediate falls, while keeping others around them at 2 for consistency. This way, we maintain consistent exploration but allow some variation where needed.
