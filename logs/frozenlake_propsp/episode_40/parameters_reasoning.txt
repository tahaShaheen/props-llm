You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get the highest possible reward by reaching state 15 without falling into any holes. From the problem description, I know that each action leads to three possible next states with equal probability because it's slippery.

Looking at the previous params and their rewards, all of them have a low f(params) around 0.05 or lower. That suggests that the current policies aren't very effective at reaching the goal consistently. The trajectories provided also show that the agent often gets stuck in loops or ends up in holes.

Since the global optimal reward should be around 1.0, I need to design a policy that almost always reaches state 15. To do this, I should ensure that each state's action leads the agent towards the goal without much risk of falling into holes.

I notice that states near the goal (like 14 and 12) might have better chances if their actions are set to move right or down accordingly. For example, state 15 is the goal, so it should stay there if reached. States like 13 and 14 should move towards 15.

Looking at state 0 (top-left corner), moving right (action 1) might be better than other actions because it can lead to state 1 or 3 or 4, depending on the slipperiness. But I need to consider all possible moves from each action and ensure they don't fall into holes.

I should also look at the trajectories given. For instance, in one trajectory, starting at (0,3) led the agent to move right, down, etc., but it didn't reach the goal. Maybe adjusting the actions for certain states can help avoid loops.

Since I'm supposed to propose a new set of params that's different from previous ones and explore more, I'll try setting some key states to specific actions that push towards the goal.

For example:
- State 0: move right (action 1)
- State 3: move down (action 0) because it can go to state 7 or 6 or 2, but moving down from 3 would take it to 7.
Wait, no, action 0 for state 3 gives a choice of moving down, left, or up. So if in state 3 and takes action 0, possible next states are 2 (up), 4 (down), or 6 (left). Hmm.

I think I need to map out each state's optimal action based on how it can lead towards the goal while avoiding holes. But without knowing where the holes are exactly, it's tricky. However, given that previous policies often ended in lower states, maybe some paths are safer than others.

Perhaps setting most states to move right or down as much as possible could help navigate towards the bottom-right corner. Also, ensuring that from each state, the agent has a chance to reach 15 without getting stuck.

I'll try creating a policy where each state's action pushes towards increasing row and column numbers. For example:
- States in the top-left (0-3) should move right or down.
- Middle states should also prioritize moving right or down.
- The last row and column can have actions that keep them in place to avoid falling.

But I need to make sure each action from a state doesn't lead into a hole. Since I don't know the exact holes, maybe setting all states near the goal to stay put would help once they reach there.

Alternatively, perhaps using a more systematic approach by assigning each state an action that maximizes the chance of moving towards 15. For example:
- State i: move right if possible, else down.

But given the slippery nature, I need to choose actions that have the highest probability of getting closer to 15.

After considering all this, I'll propose a new set of params where each state's action is chosen to either move towards increasing row or column numbers, avoiding any actions that could lead back or sideways into holes.
