You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the best possible policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to maximize the reward by reaching state 15 without falling into any holes. Let me break down what I know.

First, the environment is a 4x4 grid with states numbered from 0 to 15. Each state corresponds to a specific cell in the grid. The slippery nature of the environment means that when an action is taken, there's a 33% chance it will go in one of three directions instead of directly as intended. This adds a layer of uncertainty because moving left, right, up, or down doesn't always result in the desired direction.

The policy is defined by an array called params, where each element corresponds to a state and indicates which action to take when in that state. The actions are 0 (left/down/up), 1 (right/down/left), 2 (up/right/down), and 3 (left/up/right). Each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability.

The challenge is to design a policy that navigates the agent towards the goal at state 15 while avoiding any holes. Since I don't know where the holes are, the policy must be robust enough to handle uncertainties and avoid dangerous states.

Looking at the previous attempts, the best performing policies have an average reward around 0.35, which is much lower than the target of 1.0. This suggests that either the agent isn't reaching the goal consistently or it's falling into holes too often. The trajectories provided show that sometimes the agent gets stuck in loops or moves away from the goal.

To improve this, I should focus on designing a policy that guides the agent towards state 15 as directly as possible while minimizing the chances of ending up in a hole. Since the environment is slippery, the policy needs to account for all possible movement outcomes and ensure that each action leads closer to the goal or at least doesn't move away.

Let me consider the structure of the grid:

- The agent starts at state 0 (top-left corner).
- State 15 is the bottom-right corner.
- Each move can take the agent to one of three directions, so I need to choose actions that maximize the probability of moving towards the goal.

For example, from state 0 (top-left), possible moves are right or down. To reach the goal efficiently, moving right might be better because it leads towards higher-numbered states. However, due to the slippery nature, choosing action 1 (right/down/left) could allow for some flexibility in case the intended move doesn't happen.

I should also consider potential holes. Since I don't know their exact locations, I need a policy that avoids moving into areas where falling into a hole is likely. This might involve preferring actions that keep the agent on known safe paths towards the goal.

Another approach is to create a path that gradually moves closer to state 15. For instance, from each state, choose actions that have a higher probability of leading towards the right or down, depending on the current position.

Let me outline some key states and decide the best action for each:

- State 0 (start): Should move right or down. Action 1 allows moving right, which is better to approach the goal.
- State 1: Moving right again might be good.
- States near the top row should prioritize moving down to progress towards the bottom.
- Along the way, actions should be chosen so that even if there's a slight deviation due to slipperiness, the agent still has a chance to correct its path.

Considering this, I'll construct the params array step by step:

1. **State 0 (0,0)**: Action 1 (right/down/left). This allows moving right or down, which are both good directions towards the goal.
2. **State 1 (0,1)**: Action 3 (left/up/right). This can help in moving up if needed but also has a right option to continue towards state 4 and beyond.
3. **States along the top row (0-3)**: Prefer actions that move down or right to progress towards higher-numbered states.
4. **Middle rows**: Focus on actions that keep moving towards the goal, perhaps more down or right depending on position.

However, I need to ensure that for each state, the chosen action maximizes the probability of eventually reaching state 15 without hitting a hole. Since holes are unknown, the policy must be as safe as possible, avoiding areas with high risk.

After analyzing, I'll set actions in such a way that from each state, the agent has multiple paths towards the goal, accounting for the slipperiness. This might involve choosing actions that allow for lateral movements to correct any drift caused by the slippery environment.

Finally, compiling all these considerations into the params array, ensuring each element is an action (0-3) and covers all states from 0 to 15 with optimal choices.
