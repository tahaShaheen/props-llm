You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to find the best policy for the FrozenLake environment using a reinforcement learning approach. The goal is to get to state 15 (the right bottom grid) which gives me +1 reward, while avoiding holes. If I step on a hole, the game ends.

The policy here is represented by an array of 16 values because there are 4x4 states. Each value corresponds to the action the agent should take from that state. The actions are 0-3: left, down, right, up.

The current policy parameters are set initially, but I need to experiment with different values [0, 1, 2, 3] for each of the four states (indices 0 to 3). My goal is to find the combination that maximizes the expected reward over time. 

First, I should understand how the policy affects the transitions and rewards. The agent's behavior isn't just choosing actions randomly; it's influenced by its current state based on the parameters. For each state i (where i ranges from 0 to 3), params[i] tells me which action is best for that particular spot.

Looking at the examples provided, some policies seem better than others. For instance, having a higher value in certain actions could lead to more favorable transitions away from holes and towards the goal. However, it's crucial not to fall into any holes, so I have to make sure those are avoided.

I think a good strategy is to set the action that leads to state 15 (the goal) as highly beneficial. From the examples, in params[0], setting action 3 (up) gives higher rewards when on top left and more favorable transitions away from holes. Similarly, for other states, certain actions might be better.

I should also consider the transitions between states. Moving down from state 2 (which is row 1, column 3) to the right or up could lead me towards the goal without stepping into a hole. I need to balance moving towards the goal while avoiding dangerous areas.

Another consideration is that sometimes taking an action might have equal probability due to the environment's slipiness. This means that even in safe actions, there's some chance of slipping into a different state. So, for any action from a given state, it should account for this uncertainty.

Let me outline my approach step by step:
1. For each state (0-3), choose an action based on the corresponding parameter.
2. When choosing an action, especially in the initial steps, I want to move towards the goal while avoiding holes. For instance, from states 0 and 1, moving down might lead me closer, but if those actions are risky, I should explore other options.
3. After a few iterations, observe which policies yield better rewards, particularly focusing on reaching state 15 without falling into any holes.

I think the optimal policy will have higher values in action 3 (up) and action 2 (right), as these moves can take me towards the goal while being less risky compared to other actions. But I need to test this by experimenting with different parameter combinations.

After trying various parameters, I should see which one gives the highest average reward across multiple runs or iterations. This will help in identifying the global optimal policy.
