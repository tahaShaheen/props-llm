You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out the best policy for the FrozenLake environment based on the given information. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) with a reward of +1, avoiding holes along the way.

From the problem description, each action taken by the agent has a 33% chance of moving in three different directions due to the slippery nature of the environment. So, even if the agent takes an intended action, it might end up moving elsewhere randomly.

Looking at the top-performing params provided, they have average rewards around 0.45, which is significantly below the target of 1.0. This suggests that the current policies are not optimal and there's room for improvement.

The recent trajectories show that many attempts are getting stuck in loops or falling into holes. For example, some agents get stuck at state 4 (second row, first column) and keep moving without progressing towards the goal. To address this, I need to design a policy that avoids such loops and efficiently navigates towards the goal.

Since the environment is slippery, it's crucial for the policy to account for all possible directions each action could lead to. The agent should choose actions that maximize the chances of reaching the goal without stepping into holes.

I notice that in the top params, certain states (like 0) have action 1 or 3, which might not be optimal because they don't directly move towards the goal. Instead, perhaps moving right or down more aggressively could help.

Considering state transitions:
- State 0 is at the top-left corner. The best move would be to go right (action 1) since it's closer to the goal.
- State 1 can move right again to reach state 2.
- In states near the bottom, like 12 and 13, moving right or down might lead to the goal.

I need to ensure that each state's action selection leads towards the goal while avoiding known holes. Testing different actions in each state and observing their outcomes over multiple episodes will help identify which paths are successful.

Given that the current policies aren't performing well, it's essential to explore new configurations. Maybe adjusting certain states' actions from what has been tried before could lead to better rewards. For example, changing some action choices from 1 or 3 to 2 or 0 might create a path that avoids holes and reaches the goal more efficiently.

In summary, I'll propose a new set of params that directs the agent towards the goal more effectively by considering each state's optimal movement strategy and ensuring it doesn't get stuck in loops or fall into holes. Testing these new params will help determine if they lead to higher rewards.
