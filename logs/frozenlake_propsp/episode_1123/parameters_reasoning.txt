You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me start by understanding the problem thoroughly.

The environment is a 4x4 grid where each state can transition with some probabilities due to the slippery nature. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) for a reward of +1, while avoiding holes which end the episode immediately.

Given that the policy is represented by an array of 16 actions (each action being 0-3), I need to determine which set of parameters will maximize the average episodic reward. The current best policies have rewards around 0.45, which is far from the target of 1.0, so I should focus on exploring new configurations rather than optimizing existing ones.

Looking at the recent trajectories, many are getting stuck or falling into holes. For example, some policies loop indefinitely without reaching the goal. This suggests that the current strategies might not be effectively navigating towards state 15 while avoiding hazards.

I need to consider how each action choice affects the possible next states. Since each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability, the policy must account for this uncertainty. The optimal policy should guide the agent in a direction that statistically increases the chance of reaching state 15 without stepping on holes.

One approach is to ensure that from key positions, the actions chosen lead towards the goal while minimizing risk. For instance, states near the bottom-right (like 12, 13, 14) should prefer right or down movements if possible. However, due to the slippery nature, these actions might not always result in the intended move.

I also notice that some policies are getting stuck in loops, like moving left and up repeatedly from state 0. To break this, maybe changing the initial actions to encourage movement towards the goal could help.

Given that I need to propose a new set of parameters, I should vary the actions across different states to gather more data on which paths lead closer to the goal or into holes. This will help in refining future policies based on the rewards received.

So, for this iteration, I'll create a policy where each state has an action that encourages movement towards the right and down, but also includes some exploration. For example, states near the top-left might choose to move right (action 1) or down (action 0), while states in the lower part might prefer right or up depending on their position.

I need to ensure that each params[i] is unique from previous ones to maximize information gain. So I'll vary several actions across different states, especially in areas where the current policies are failing.

After considering all this, here's a proposed set of parameters that should help explore more effective paths towards state 15 while reducing the risk of falling into holes.
