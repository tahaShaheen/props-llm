You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to find the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment with the given constraints. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right corner) and avoid entering any holes on the map. Each action movement has some uncertainty because of the slippery environment.

First, I understand that each action's next state probabilities are affected by the slipiness. For example, when taking action 0, the agent can move down, left, or up with equal probability (25% chance each). Similarly, other actions have different combinations, but in this case, all four actions have movements where at least one direction is safe.

The policy function maps each state to an action. The agent uses a predefined array of parameters for states 0 to 15. These parameters determine the probabilities of taking each action from their respective states. My task is to set these parameters so that the expected reward (f(params)) is maximized.

Looking at the examples provided, various combinations of params were tested. Some resulted in higher rewards than others. For instance, the first example had a reward of 1.00, another similar one also achieved 1.00, and some even dropped it to 0.25 or lower. These suggest that finding an optimal set requires balancing exploration (trying new paths) and exploitation (focusing on known good actions).

Since the environment is slippery, it's important to explore thoroughly without over-relying on current knowledge. The agent should try states with higher uncertainty first to gather more information before committing to known high-reward actions.

I also need to consider that when an action leads into a hole or the goal, it results in a reward of 0 except for the final state which gives +1. Thus, the policy must avoid such dangerous areas as much as possible.

To approach this systematically, I might use methods like Q-learning or SARSA, but since the problem states that params are fixed and each step changes based on the current state's action probabilities, it seems more like a deterministic policy optimization problem with uncertainty in transitions.

I should consider using techniques to sample multiple parameter sets, evaluate their expected rewards, and iteratively refine them. Given that 400 iterations are allowed, I can afford some exploration, especially as the agent might not have encountered all possible states yet.

One approach is to randomly sample parameter values from the given options (0-3) for each state and compute the average reward across these samples. The parameters with higher average rewards should be favored over those with lower ones in subsequent iterations. Additionally, keeping track of which parameter combinations are being used can help avoid repeating them while still exploring new ones.

I also need to ensure that the policy doesn't get stuck in local optima. Therefore, it's crucial to mix different parameter settings that might result in varying expected rewards. This balance between exploration and exploitation is key to finding the global maximum reward.

In summary, my plan involves:
1. Randomly sampling parameter combinations.
2. Evaluating each combination's expected reward.
3. Keeping track of which ones are used.
4. Using the best performing parameters for subsequent steps while occasionally exploring new ones.

I'll start by randomly selecting parameter values for all states and compute their average rewards. This will help identify promising directions to explore next without making too many mistakes on known paths.
