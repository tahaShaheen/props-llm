You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to help find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. So, first, let me understand the problem.

The grid is 4x4, with states from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). The agent can move in four directions, but because of the slippery nature, each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability. For example, if the agent chooses action 0, it can go down, left, or up. This adds a layer of uncertainty since the next state isn't guaranteed.

The goal is to reach state 15, which gives a reward of +1. All other states give 0, but some are holes that end the episode if stepped on.

Given that the environment is slippery and has holes, the policy needs to avoid these holes while navigating towards the goal. The policy is represented as an array of 16 actions (each from 0-3) corresponding to each state.

From the history provided, I see some parameters tried but their rewards are around 0.2-0.45, which is much lower than the target of 1.0. So, we're probably not exploiting enough yet, or maybe exploring too much without finding a good path.

The recent params mostly have low rewards, suggesting that the current policies aren't reaching the goal often. Therefore, I should focus on parameters that guide the agent towards state 15 with minimal risk of falling into holes.

Looking at the trajectories, some get stuck in loops or fall into holes quickly. For example, one trajectory went (0,1) and then fell into a hole after a few steps. So, it's crucial to design policies that avoid such paths.

I need to propose parameters that:

1. Move towards state 15 systematically.
2. Avoid states known to be holes or paths leading to them.

Maybe focusing on moving right and down more since the goal is at the bottom-right corner.

Wait, but because of the slippery nature, choosing actions that generally push towards the right and down might help, despite the stochasticity.

For example, in state 0 (top-left), taking action 1 (which has a chance to go right, down, or left). If it goes down, it's closer. Similarly, for other states, choose actions that have a higher probability of moving towards the goal without leading into holes.

But how do I know which states are holes? The user hasn't specified them, but based on trajectories, some states lead to failure quickly. So, I need to make sure that each state's action doesn't lead into a hole with high probability.

Alternatively, perhaps the best approach is to have policies that try to move towards the right and down as much as possible, adjusting when near the edges.

Wait, but without knowing which states are holes, it's challenging. Maybe assume that certain positions are holes based on past trajectories.

Looking at the top 5 params with their trajectories, for example:

- One trajectory went (0,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,3) -> (3,0). It ended because state 3 is maybe a hole? Or perhaps it's the next move that caused it to fall.

Alternatively, maybe states like 5,6,7, etc., are holes. But I don't have exact info.

Given that, perhaps the optimal policy should prioritize moving towards the goal while avoiding any known dangerous areas.

Another approach is to set all policies to move right or down as much as possible, but given the slippery nature, each action leads to three possibilities.

Wait, for example, in state 0 (top-left), which has position (0,0). The goal is at (3,3). So moving right would be towards the target. Action 1 from state 0 can lead to right (to state 1), down (state 4), or left (back to state 0). Since we want to move towards the goal, action 1 seems better.

Similarly, for other states, choosing actions that have a chance to move closer to the goal.

But also, need to avoid getting stuck in loops. So, perhaps setting policies that prevent moving back unless necessary.

Wait, but without knowing the hole locations, maybe it's safer to try to move right and down as much as possible.

So, for each state, choose an action that has a higher chance of moving towards the goal. For example:

- In states where you're not on the last row or column, prefer actions that can move right or down.

But considering the slippery nature, each action might lead to three different moves.

Wait, let's think about each possible state and what actions would help.

For instance:

State 0 (top-left):
Possible actions:
- Action 1: can go right (state 1), down (4), or left (0). So, maybe action 1 is good because it has a chance to move right or down.

State 1 (top-middle):
Action 3 allows moving up, right, or left. Wait, no, the description says:

Wait, correction: The environment's slippery effect depends on the action chosen.

When action is 0: moves are [down, left, up]
action 1: [right, down, left]
action 2: [up, right, down]
action 3: [left, up, right]

So for each state and action, the next states are determined by these possible movements.

Given that, perhaps choosing actions that have a higher chance of moving towards the goal without hitting holes.

But without knowing which states are holes, maybe we can assume some based on past trajectories. For example, in one trajectory, taking action 0 from state 3 led to state 0, which might be a hole? Or perhaps it's just part of the environment.

Alternatively, think about setting up policies that try to move towards the goal while avoiding edges or corners where holes are more likely.

Wait, maybe I should focus on states that can lead directly to the goal. For example, from state 12 (bottom-left), moving right leads to 13, then 14, then 15. So, for state 12, choosing action 1 or 2 might help move towards the goal.

But I'm not sure about the exact hole locations, so perhaps a better approach is to generate parameters that have a systematic way of moving towards the goal while trying different paths.

Alternatively, since all previous attempts have low rewards, maybe it's time to switch strategies. Instead of tweaking similar policies, try something completely different to explore new trajectories and gather more information about which states are safe or not.

But given that we're at iteration 1026 out of 5000, perhaps it's better to start optimizing if some high-reward parameters have been found before. However, in the provided data, the best reward is around 0.45, so maybe we need a more effective strategy.

Perhaps focusing on states that are closer to the goal and setting their actions to directly move towards it. For example:

- State 14 (second last in row 3) should take action 2 or 3 to move right to 15.
- Similarly, state 11 can take action 3 to move right to 12 or up to 7, etc.

But without knowing the hole positions, it's tricky. Alternatively, set all policies to prefer actions that have a higher chance of moving towards the goal.

Another idea is to use a greedy approach where each state chooses the action that has the highest probability of leading to the goal, considering possible movements.

For example, in state 0:

- Action 1: can go right (state1), down(state4), or left(0). So, choosing action 1 gives two chances to move closer.
- Action 3: from state0, action3 would have [left, up, right]. Left leads back, so less favorable.

So, perhaps action1 is better for state0.

Similarly, in state1:

Action 3 allows moving left (state0), right(state2), or up(state5). Since the goal is down-right, maybe action3 isn't ideal. Alternatively, action2 could be considered.

Wait, but without knowing which states are holes, it's hard to decide.

Perhaps I should generate a set of parameters where each state has an action that generally moves towards the right and down as much as possible, considering the possible movements.

For example:

- For states in the top row (0-3), prefer actions that move down or right.
- For states in the leftmost column (0,4,8,12), prefer actions that move right or down.

But again, without knowing holes, this is speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps set all policies to choose action 2, which allows moving up, right, or down. This might help explore more directions.

Wait, but in state0, action2 would be [up, right, down], which from (0,0) can't go up, so possible moves are right and down, both towards the goal.

Similarly, in state1 (0,1), action2 allows moving up (invalid?), right(state2), or down(state5). So that could help.

Wait, but the exact mapping needs to be clear. For example:

Each state is from 0-15. Let's map them as rows and columns.

Row 0: states 0 (0,0), 1 (0,1), 2 (0,2), 3 (0,3)
Row 1: 4 (1,0), 5 (1,1), 6 (1,2), 7 (1,3)
Row 2: 8 (2,0),9 (2,1),10(2,2),11(2,3)
Row 3:12 (3,0),13(3,1),14(3,2),15(3,3)

So, to move towards the goal at (3,3):

From any state not in row3 or column3, prefer moving right or down.

But considering the slippery nature:

- Action 0: [down, left, up]
- Action1: [right, down, left]
- Action2: [up, right, down]
- Action3: [left, up, right]

So, for state s not in row3 and column3:

If possible, choose actions that have a higher chance of moving right or down.

For example:

State0 (0,0):
Possible actions:
- action1: can move right (state1), down(state4), left (invalid). So action1 is good.
- action2: can move up (invalid), right(state2), down(state8). Also has right and down.

But since the goal is at (3,3), moving towards both right and down is good. However, because of the slippery nature, each action gives 3 options.

So, perhaps choosing actions that include right or down in their possible moves.

Alternatively, for state0, choose action1, which includes a chance to move right or down.

Similarly, for state1 (0,1):

Possible actions:

- action1: [right(state2), down(state5), left(state0)]
- action3: [left(state0), up(state4?), right(state2)]

Wait, need to clarify the movement from each state.

For example, moving up from state1 would go to state - but wait, row 0 is the top. So, moving up from state1 (0,1) might not be possible; perhaps it stays or wraps around? But in FrozenLake, usually, you can't move beyond the grid, so moving up from state1 would stay at state1.

Wait, no, in standard FrozenLake, moving into a direction that's out of bounds doesn't change the state. So for state0 (0,0), moving left or up stays at state0.

So, in state1:

- action1: [right(state2), down(state5), left(state0)]
- action3: [left(state0), up(stays at 1?), right(state2)]

Hmm, so both actions 1 and 3 allow moving right (state2) or back. So perhaps choosing action1 for state1 is better as it also includes a move down to state5.

But without knowing if state5 is a hole or not, this is tricky.

Given the uncertainty, maybe I should set all states to choose actions that have the highest chance of moving towards the goal, considering possible moves.

Alternatively, perhaps setting all policies to action 2 for each state except when near the edges. But I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at the top5 params:

They mostly have action1 or 3 in the initial states, which might suggest that these actions are leading to some progress but still getting stuck.

Another approach is to try a policy where each state chooses an action that maximizes the chance of moving towards the goal. For example, for each state, calculate the probabilities of reaching the goal from each possible action and choose the one with the highest probability.

But without knowing which states are holes or the exact dynamics, this is difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps I can try a policy where in each state, the agent tries to move right if possible, otherwise down. This would guide it towards the goal systematically.

So, for example:

- In row 0: choose action1 (right) for states 0,1,2; but wait, in state3 (row0, column3), moving right isn't possible, so perhaps move down.
- Similarly, in other rows, prefer moving right until the end of the row, then move down.

But considering the slippery nature, each action leads to three possibilities. So, for example, in state0, choosing action1 gives a chance to go right or down, which are both good.

So, perhaps setting up the policy as follows:

For states not in the last column (columns 0-2):

- If in row r and column c <3:
   - Choose action that can move right or down.
   For example, action1 for top rows except when near edges.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe a better approach is to try varying the actions slightly from previous policies but ensure they don't repeat any previously tried params.

Looking back at the history, the recent params include various combinations of 0-3 in each state, but all have low rewards. So perhaps it's time to explore new configurations that haven't been tried before, focusing on different paths towards the goal.

Alternatively, maybe I should set some states to choose actions that directly aim for the goal, even if it means taking a risk.

Given the constraints and the information available, I'll propose a parameter set where each state chooses an action that primarily aims to move right or down, considering their possible outcomes.
