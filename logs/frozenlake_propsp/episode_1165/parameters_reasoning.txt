You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, let me try to figure this out step by step. So, the problem is about optimizing a policy for the FrozenLake environment to maximize the reward. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) which gives +1 reward, while avoiding holes that end the episode.

First, I need to understand the environment dynamics. It's a 4x4 grid with slippery movement. When an action is taken, the agent moves in one of three directions randomly with equal probability. For example, taking action 0 can lead to moving down, left, or up, each with 1/3 chance.

The policy is defined by an array 'params' where each element corresponds to a state (from 0 to 15) and determines the action taken in that state. My task is to find the optimal set of actions for each state to maximize the average reward over multiple episodes.

Looking at the provided data, I see that the best performing policies so far have an average reward around 0.45. The goal is to reach close to 1.0, which would mean almost always reaching the goal without falling into holes.

The recent attempts show a lot of variability, with some policies earning 0.10 or 0.05 rewards but others performing slightly better. Since we're at iteration 1165 out of 5000, there's still plenty of time to refine the policy.

I notice that in the top-performing params, certain states are taking specific actions. For example, state 0 is often set to action 1 or 2. I should think about what actions lead towards the goal without risking falling into holes.

Since the environment is slippery, it's crucial for each state to have an action that maximizes the chance of moving closer to the goal while avoiding dangerous states. For instance, being in state 0 (top-left corner), moving right or down might be safer depending on where the holes are located.

However, I don't have the exact locations of the holes provided. That's a challenge because without knowing which states are holes, it's harder to avoid them. But from the trajectories, I can infer possible dangerous areas based on where previous policies failed.

For example, if a policy often fails when moving in a certain direction from state 5 (which is position (0,1) in row terms), then perhaps that action leads into a hole. So, for state 5, choosing an action that doesn't lead towards known dangerous areas might be better.

Looking at the recent trajectories, one policy led to immediate failure after moving down or right from certain states. This suggests that some paths are riskier than others.

I think a good strategy would be to make sure that each state's action is designed to move as directly as possible towards the goal (state 15) while avoiding any direction that could lead into a hole based on previous failures.

For example, in state 14 (which is just one step away from the goal), taking action 3 (right or up, I think) might be optimal. Wait, no—state 14 is actually to the left of the goal. So moving right would take it to 15. But considering the slippery nature, maybe choosing a direction that increases the chance of moving towards the goal.

I need to map out for each state what are the possible next states based on each action and then choose the actions that maximize the probability of reaching the goal without hitting holes.

This seems like a dynamic programming problem where I can model transitions and compute value functions, but since I'm supposed to do this step-by-step without memory, I have to make educated guesses based on previous data.

Another approach is to look at the most recent policies and see if tweaking them slightly could improve performance. For instance, in the last successful policy with 0.45 reward, maybe adjusting a few actions that seem risky could lead to better outcomes.

Alternatively, since we're still early in the iteration count (1165/5000), perhaps exploring more diverse policies would help uncover better performing configurations.

I should also consider symmetry and patterns. For example, states on the edges might have different optimal actions compared to central states. Maybe a policy that encourages moving towards the right or down is generally better for most states.

But without knowing the exact hole locations, it's tricky. So perhaps focusing on making sure that each state has an action that doesn't lead into known dangerous trajectories would be safer.

Looking at the recent failures, some policies failed by getting stuck in loops or falling into holes when taking certain actions. For example, from state 12 (which is the third row, first column), taking action 0 might lead to a hole, so maybe choosing a different action there could prevent failure.

Overall, I think the best approach here is to propose a policy that for each state selects an action that moves towards the goal as much as possible while avoiding actions that have led to failures in previous attempts. Since we're still exploring, varying some actions from the top-performing policies might help discover better configurations.
