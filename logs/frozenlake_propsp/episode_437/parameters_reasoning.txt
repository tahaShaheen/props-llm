You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help the user find the global optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment they described. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.

First, the environment is a 4x4 grid, which means there are 16 states (0-15). The goal is state 15, and stepping on any hole ends the episode with no reward except for reaching state 15, which gives +1. The slippery nature of the environment adds complexity because each action leads to a random next state with equal probability among three possible directions.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 parameters (params[0] to params[15]), where each parameter can be 0-3, representing the action taken in that state. The user wants to maximize the episodic reward, which should ideally approach 1.0 if the optimal policy is found.

Looking at the interaction steps, I see that the user provides MAX_ITERATIONS (5000), and then we alternate between me proposing a new set of params and them giving feedback on the reward for the last proposed params. The challenge is to do this without memory, so each proposal must be based solely on the information provided in the buffer.

The user has given some example top-performing params with their rewards and trajectories. From that, I can see that most policies are yielding low rewards (around 0.2-0.3). This suggests that the current strategies aren't effectively navigating towards state 15 without falling into holes or getting stuck in loops.

The user's instructions emphasize exploration when rewards are far below 1.0 and optimization when close to 1.0. Since the current top policies yield around 0.3, which is significantly lower than 1.0, I should focus on exploring new parameter configurations rather than tweaking existing ones.

One approach is to analyze the trajectories provided to identify patterns that lead to failure or success. For example, some trajectories show the agent getting stuck in a loop or falling into holes repeatedly. By understanding these, we can adjust the policy to avoid such paths.

I notice that many policies are cycling through certain states without making progress towards state 15. Perhaps changing the actions in key states (like near the goal) could help the agent move more directly towards the target. For instance, states closer to 15 might benefit from a right or down action, depending on their position.

Another consideration is the slippery nature. Since each action leads to three possible next states, the policy needs to account for all possibilities and choose actions that statistically increase the chances of reaching state 15 while minimizing the risk of falling into holes.

Looking at the recent params provided, most have low rewards, so it's crucial to try entirely new configurations. Maybe adjusting certain states' actions could lead the agent towards a more direct path or avoid dangerous areas.

I should also consider the structure of the grid. The optimal policy would likely guide the agent from any starting point towards state 15 in as few steps as possible while avoiding holes. This might involve mapping out safe paths and ensuring that each action increases the likelihood of moving closer to the goal.

Given all this, I think a good next step is to propose a new set of params where key states are adjusted to push the agent towards the goal more effectively. For example, ensuring that states near state 15 have actions that would move directly towards it or at least keep the agent in a path that leads there.

But since I can't remember previous attempts, each proposal must be unique and based on maximizing information gain. So I'll need to systematically vary the parameters across different states to identify which changes lead to higher rewards.
