You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get the highest reward, which is around 1.0 as mentioned. From the problem statement, I know that each state has a slippery nature, meaning actions don't always lead directly to their intended next state but instead have three possible outcomes with equal probability.

Looking at the provided top params and their trajectories, it seems like the best performing policies so far are giving around 0.20 average reward, which is much lower than the target of 1.0. This suggests that we're not yet on the right track. My job is to propose a new set of parameters that might explore different paths or avoid holes more effectively.

I notice that in the top examples, many policies are getting stuck or falling into holes quickly. For instance, one trajectory went from (0,1) to (4,2), then to (8,2). Maybe if I can create a policy where certain states lead towards the goal without stepping on holes.

Let me think about each state and what action would be best. The starting position is 0 (top-left corner). From there, moving right or down might make sense, but since actions are slippery, perhaps choosing an action that has a higher chance of getting closer to the goal despite the slipperiness.

State 15 is the goal, so any state leading towards it should be prioritized. Also, I need to identify which states are holes. From the trajectories, I can see that some transitions lead to holes but without knowing exactly where they are, I have to infer based on the trajectories provided.

For example, in one of the top params, after taking action 1 from state 0, it went to state 4 (down), then to state 8. But another trajectory starting at 0 with action 2 went to state 3, then back to state 0 again, which might indicate a hole or getting stuck.

I should consider for each state what actions would likely lead towards the goal without falling into holes. For instance, in state 14 (which is one step away from the goal), choosing an action that has a high probability of moving right or up/down might be beneficial.

Perhaps I need to design a policy where states closer to the goal have actions pointing directly towards it, while other states choose actions that balance exploration and movement towards the goal. Also, considering that some actions might lead into holes, I should choose actions for each state that minimize the risk of falling into a hole while maximizing the chance of reaching the goal.

Looking at the most recent policies, they seem to have lower rewards, maybe because they're not effectively navigating around the holes or are getting stuck in loops. So perhaps adjusting certain states' actions to avoid known problematic transitions could help.

I think I should propose a new set of parameters where each state's action is chosen based on the highest probability to reach the goal without stepping into a hole, considering the slippery nature of movements. Maybe for some states, choosing an action that has multiple safe directions or leads towards safer areas of the grid.

Given all this, I'll create a new params array by selecting actions for each state that either directly aim towards the goal or lead to other states with higher chances of success.
