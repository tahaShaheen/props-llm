You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to find the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment using a reinforcement learning approach. The goal is to reach state 15, which is the bottom right corner of the grid, and get as much reward as possible. The agent starts at state 0 and can move in four directions: left, down, right, up. 

The policies are represented by an array of parameters where each value (0-3) corresponds to an action. However, some states have holes that require exploration through previous trajectories. I need to explore these holes by reading history, which means the agent should avoid going into any hole it has encountered before.

First, I'll start with the default policy where all actions are taken with equal probability (1/3 for each direction). Then, I'll evaluate how this performs in terms of rewards and identify any holes that might block progress. 

Looking at the top parameters provided, some have issues like params[0]: 2, which leads to state 4, a hole, but others don't. From these examples, it seems that actions should avoid the hole states as much as possible.

I realize that without enough exploration in specific hole areas, the agent might get stuck or reinforce on bad paths. So, I need to systematically try different policies around the holes. For each hole state (like 4 and 7), the agent should try all possible action sequences until it either reaches the goal or gets stuck.

I also notice that some policies are better than others, like params[0]:2, which leads to a high reward in many states but could be bad near the hole. I'll need to balance exploration and exploitation by sometimes sticking with a policy if it's consistently performing well, while occasionally exploring other paths when necessary.

After several trials and evaluations, I should converge on a policy that maximizes the reward without falling into any holes, thus achieving the global optimal reward of None.
