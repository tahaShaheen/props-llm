You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. So, let's break it down step by step.

First, I know that the goal is state 15 (the bottom-right corner), and all other states give 0 reward except when reaching 15. The catch is that the lake is slippery, meaning each action can lead to three possible directions with equal probability. So, the agent's actual movement isn't straightforward.

Looking at the provided data, the best-performing policies have average rewards around 0.30, which is still way below the target of 1.0. That suggests that while there are some good attempts, we're not consistently reaching the goal. The recent policies also show low rewards, so I'm in "Explorer" mode—time to try new configurations.

I need to design a policy where each state chooses an action that maximizes the chance of moving towards 15 without falling into any holes. But since I don't know where the holes are exactly, I have to infer based on previous trajectories.

From the top-performing params, some states are choosing actions that might be leading closer or avoiding edges. For example, state 0 (top-left) choosing action 2 (up), but up from 0 would keep it in place due to grid boundaries. Maybe that's not optimal. Alternatively, moving right (action 1) could help move towards the goal.

I should consider making states near the goal more likely to stay there or push further. For instance, state 14 is just one step away; setting its action to go up might help if that leads directly to 15, but I'm not sure about the grid's layout. Also, avoiding edges where holes are likely—like maybe states near the right edge (like 3,7, etc.) should be cautious.

Another approach is to make the policy more deterministic in certain key areas. For example, state 0 could always move right (action 1) to start moving towards the goal without getting stuck. Similarly, state 4 might benefit from moving down or right depending on what's safe.

Since all recent policies have low rewards, I should try a completely new set of params that haven't been tried before, focusing on different paths and actions to see if any lead closer to the goal.

After considering these factors, I'll propose a new set of parameters where each state chooses an action that either moves towards 15 or avoids potential holes. For example:
- State 0 (top-left) could choose down (action 0), which might move it to 4, 0, or back to itself.
- States closer to the goal should have actions that push them directly towards 15.

I'll map out each state's action based on their position relative to 15 and potential safety. This way, I can maximize the chance of reaching the goal while minimizing the risk of falling into holes.

Finally, after mapping this out, I'll come up with a new set of params that have not been tried yet, ensuring they're distinct from previous attempts. This should help explore new trajectories and potentially find a higher reward path.
