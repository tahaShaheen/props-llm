You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. So, the goal is to reach state 15, which gives a reward of +1, while avoiding holes that end the episode. The grid is 4x4, and each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability due to the slippery nature.

First, I need to understand where the holes are because they end the game if stepped on. From the provided trajectories, I can infer some potential hole positions based on where agents fell into them.

Looking at the top 6 best-performing params and their trajectories:

1. The first policy had a reward of 0.25 with a trajectory that went from state 0 to 4 (down) then to 8. Maybe this means state 4 is safe, but perhaps moving down from state 0 isn't leading to the goal quickly.

2. Another policy tried different actions and got lower rewards, suggesting maybe not all paths are effective.

In the most recent five policies, some trajectories ended quickly with low rewards or fell into holes. For example, one trajectory went (0,3) multiple times before moving down, which might indicate that staying in place isn't helping.

I need to design a policy that maximizes the chance of reaching state 15 while avoiding known holes. Since I can't remember past attempts, I have to choose each time without prior knowledge, focusing on maximizing information gain.

Given the current best policies have rewards around 0.25, which is below the target of 1.0, it's better to explore more rather than exploit. So, I should propose a new set of params that haven't been tried before and can potentially lead to higher rewards or reveal more about the hole positions.

I'll consider setting each state's action to move towards the goal as much as possible. For example, from the top row (0-3), moving right or down might be better. From states closer to the bottom-right corner, actions that push towards 15 are preferred.

Let me assign specific actions:

- States in the top-left should move right or down.
- Middle states should try to move towards the goal direction.
- Avoid staying still unless it's near the goal and safe.

After considering all this, I'll create a new params array where each state selects an action that has a higher chance of moving towards the goal without falling into known holes. This will likely involve choosing actions that increase the probability of reaching state 15 while avoiding dangerous moves.
