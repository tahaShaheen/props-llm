You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me break down what I know.

First, the environment is a 4x4 grid with states numbered from 0 to 15. The goal is state 15 (bottom right corner), which gives +1 reward. All other states give 0, except if you step on a hole, the episode ends. The slippery nature means each action has a 33% chance of moving in one of three directions.

The policy is a function that maps each state to an action (0-3). My task is to propose a set of params (16 values) that the agent should take in each state, aiming for the highest possible reward.

Looking at the provided information:

- The top 5 best params have rewards around 0.25 or lower. That's not great because we're aiming for around 1.0.
- The most recent 4 policies all have low rewards (0.05 and below), so they're underperforming.

Since the rewards are far below the target, I should be in "Explorer" mode, trying out new configurations to gather more information rather than tweaking existing ones.

I need to propose a params array that's distinct from previous attempts. Let me check what previous policies looked like.

In the top 5, some had all actions set to 1 or similar patterns. The recent ones seem to have more varied actions but still low rewards.

Maybe I can try setting different actions for each state, especially focusing on paths leading towards the goal (state 15) while avoiding holes. Since it's slippery, the policy should choose actions that maximize the chance of moving towards the goal without falling into holes.

For example:
- Start from state 0: action 2 (up or right or down). Maybe up to move towards row 3.
- State 1: action 3 (left, up, right). Maybe right to get closer to the end.
- Continue this pattern, ensuring each state's action pushes towards 15 without hitting holes.

But since I can't remember previous policies exactly, I need to generate a new one that's different. Let me pick a mix of actions, perhaps alternating between directions to cover multiple paths and avoid getting stuck in loops or falling into holes.

Wait, the environment is slippery, so each action has 3 possible outcomes. Maybe setting all actions to move towards right or down could eventually lead to state 15. But I need to make sure that from any state, there's a path leading towards 15 without hitting a hole.

Alternatively, maybe setting some states to stay still? No, because staying in place isn't an option; each action leads to movement in three directions.

I should probably focus on states near the goal and set their actions to move right or down. For example:
- States 12 (row 3, column 0): moving right or down (but down is out of bounds, so right.
- Similarly, state 14: moving right would take it to 15.

But I need to set all states' actions. Let me try creating a params array where each state's action pushes towards the goal as much as possible.

Perhaps for each state, choose an action that increases either row or column towards 3 (assuming rows and columns are 0-indexed). So:

- For states in row 0: move down.
- For states in column 0: move right.
But considering the slippery nature, this might not always work. Alternatively, set all actions to 2 or 1, which include both directions.

Wait, let me check what each action does:
- Action 0: [down, left, up]
- Action 1: [right, down, left]
- Action 2: [up, right, down]
- Action 3: [left, up, right]

I think I should choose actions that have a higher chance of moving towards the goal. For example:
- From state i, if possible, move right or down.

Looking at action 1: has right and down, which are good for moving towards 15. Action 2 includes right and down as well.

So maybe setting most states to action 1 or 2 would be beneficial.

But in previous policies, many had similar approaches but still low rewards. Perhaps I need to vary the actions more to avoid getting stuck on holes.

Alternatively, perhaps a deterministic approach is better despite the slippery nature. Maybe set each state to move right or down as much as possible.

Let me try setting:

- For states where row < 3: action 2 (up, right, down). Up might help in moving towards higher rows.
Wait, no—rows are from top to bottom as 0 to 3. So moving down increases the row number.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should set each state's action based on their position:

- If current row < 3: move down (action 0 has down, but also left and up). But that might not be optimal.
Alternatively, choose actions that have right and down as possible outcomes.

Action 1 includes right, down, left. So for states where moving right or down would help, action 1 could be good.

Let me try setting most params to action 1 and see what happens. Maybe the agent can navigate towards the goal more effectively this way.

But looking at previous attempts, some had all actions set to 1 but didn't perform well. So maybe I need a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps using action 3 for certain states where moving right is needed.

Wait, another idea: since the environment is slippery, maybe the agent needs to take a path that's robust against getting stuck in holes. Perhaps staying on certain rows or columns can avoid holes.

But without knowing where the holes are exactly, it's hard to design such a policy. So I have to make general assumptions.

Given all this, perhaps setting each state's action to either 1 or 2 would give the best chance of moving towards the goal. Let me try that.

Let me create a params array where:

- States in row 0 (0-3): action 2 (up is not helpful, but right and down are)
Wait, no—row 0 is the top row. So from state 0 (top left), moving down would take it to state 4, which is the second row.

Alternatively, setting all states in column 0 to move right, as that's the direction towards the goal.

But since each action has multiple possibilities, I need to ensure that there's a path leading to the goal without falling into holes.

Given the time constraints and my current understanding, I'll propose a params array where most actions are either 1 or 2, focusing on right and down movements.
