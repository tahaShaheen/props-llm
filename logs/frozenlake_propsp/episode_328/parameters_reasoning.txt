You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 328 out of 400. OUTPUT ONLY THIS SINGLE LINE:
params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W
Do NOT output anything else. No explanation, no reasoning, nothing.



LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the global optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment using a policy gradient method. The environment is slippery, which means each action (except staying in place) leads to one of three directions with equal probability. The goal is to reach state 15 (state 3,3), and all other states give zero reward except the goal, which gives +1. There are some holes on the map that end the game, so I need to explore through them.

The policy is a function that maps each state to an action. The current parameters are an array of 16 numbers, where each number corresponds to the probability of taking one of four actions from each state. However, all these initial parameters are set to 1.0, which might not be optimal yet.

I need to adjust the params values based on the provided examples and recent information. The top performing param sets have some combination of 0,1,2,3 assigned to different states, aiming for a balance between exploration and exploitation. For instance, in one example, action 0 is taken most often from state 8 (params[2]=3), which might mean the agent tends to take down moves when it's facing certain obstacles.

Since all params are initialized to 1.0, I need to find a configuration that allows exploration of states with holes while still moving towards the goal. The global optimal should maximize the reward by exploring the slippery environment effectively.

Given that the current policy is unexplored yet (all 1.0), perhaps starting with more balanced probabilities would encourage some random movement (actions 0,1,2) in different states could help avoid getting stuck in holes. But I have to balance that with moving towards the goal, especially state 15.

I should consider adjusting certain parameters so that sometimes the agent doesn't settle into a hole but instead moves around it, using other directions to navigate through obstacles.
