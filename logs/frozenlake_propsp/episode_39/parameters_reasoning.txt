You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15, which gives a reward of +1, while avoiding holes that end the episode with 0 rewards.

First, I need to understand how the slippery nature affects movement. Each action has three possible outcomes, each with equal probability. For example, moving left might take me down, up, or stay in place? Wait, no—the description says when you take an action, you move in one of three directions with equal chance. So for each action, there are three possible next states.

Looking at the grid, state 0 is (0,0), 15 is (3,3). The holes are probably some specific states that aren't revealed yet, but I need to infer them based on trajectories. From the provided examples, it seems like when the agent steps into a hole, the trajectory ends without reaching 15.

In the top-performing params, most have f(params) around 0.05, which is low. That suggests that the current policies aren't reaching the goal often, perhaps because they're falling into holes or getting stuck in loops.

I should think about safe paths that avoid these holes. For instance, state 14 (3,2) and 15 are adjacent. Maybe from certain states, choosing an action that leads towards 15 without crossing a hole is better.

Looking at the recent params, many have f(params) around 0.05 or lower, so maybe they're not optimal yet. Since all rewards are low, I'm in the "Explorer" phase—need to try different policies to gather more information.

I should propose a policy that takes actions leading towards the goal while avoiding possible holes. For example, from state 14 (3,2), moving right would take it to 15 if possible, but since it's slippery, maybe other actions are safer.

Wait, actually, in the grid:

- State 0 is (0,0)
- Moving down from 0 leads to 4 (but with some probability also left or up, which might be out of bounds? Or does it stay?)

I need to make sure that each state's action doesn't lead into a hole. From the trajectories provided, I can see where agents end, either by falling into a hole or reaching the goal.

Looking at the recent params:

One trajectory was (0,3) leading to various states but not reaching the goal. Another went from 0,0 down and eventually reached 8,3 which might be near the hole.

I think I should design a policy that moves towards the right and down as much as possible since the goal is at (3,3). So for each state, choose actions that generally increase row or column indices.

But considering the slipperiness, sometimes moving in one direction might take you elsewhere. Maybe from some states, choosing multiple directions can help navigate around holes.

Wait, maybe it's better to have a deterministic policy but given the slipperiness, the actual movement is stochastic. So I need to choose actions that maximize the chance of reaching 15 without hitting a hole.

Looking at state 12 (3,0), which is on the bottom row, column 0. From there, moving right leads to 13 (3,1). If there's a hole, maybe it's better to move up or down? But since it's the bottom row, moving down might not be possible.

Wait, no— FrozenLake is usually modeled with wrap-around or walls? The problem statement doesn't specify, so I assume that moving beyond grid boundaries stays in place. Or perhaps movement is allowed only within the grid, and any move outside wraps around. Hmm, but since it's a 4x4 grid, maybe movement beyond edges isn't possible.

Wait no—the standard FrozenLake has ice where you can fall through if not on the goal or start. So the holes are certain states that end the episode with 0 reward.

Given that the trajectories show some agents falling into loops or ending without reaching the goal, I need to find a path that avoids those loops and leads straight to 15.

Maybe from state 8 (2,0), moving right multiple times could lead towards the goal. From 8, actions might take you to 9 (2,1), 12 (3,0), or back to 4 (1,0). So choosing action that tends to move down or right.

Alternatively, perhaps a policy that prioritizes moving right and down in certain states could help reach the goal more efficiently.

Looking at the recent params, for example:

params[0]:1; ... which is action 1. Let me check what action 1 does: when you take action 1, you can move right, down, or left with equal probability.

So from state 0 (top-left corner), taking action 1 could lead to moving right to 1, down to 4, or left—but since it's the top-left, moving left might stay in place. Wait, no—the grid is 4x4, so moving left from 0 would probably stay at 0.

So if I set params[0] = 1, then taking action 1 could move right to state 1 with probability 1/3, down to 4 with 1/3, or left (stay) with 1/3. That might be a good start as it explores different paths.

But I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Maybe from some states, a specific action is better than others to avoid holes.

Wait, considering the trajectories provided:

In one trajectory, starting at state 0, taking action 1 led to state 4 (down), then action 2 (which could be up, right, down). But in that case, it went to state 8. So maybe from state 4, action 2 is leading further down.

Another trajectory started with action 3 from state 0: which allows moving left, up, or right. From state 0, moving left would stay at 0, moving up might not be possible (as it's the top row), so perhaps that action isn't useful.

I think I need to propose a policy where each state has an action that increases the chance of moving towards the goal without getting stuck in loops or falling into holes. Since all current policies yield low rewards, I should explore different configurations.

Perhaps setting params[15] = 2 (up) would make sense if the agent is at the goal and wants to stay there. But since reaching 15 gives a reward, maybe staying isn't necessary, but avoiding further movement could help.

Wait, no—reaching 15 ends the episode with +1. So once there, it's done. So perhaps params[15] can be any action, as the episode would have terminated already.

Looking back at previous attempts, one of the top policies had f(params) = 0.05, which is very low. That suggests that the current strategies aren't effective, so I need to try something different.

Maybe a greedy approach where each state chooses the action most likely to lead towards 15 without crossing known holes.

But since I don't know the exact positions of the holes, I have to infer them from trajectories.

For example, if an agent takes certain actions and ends up in a hole, that can indicate which states are holes.

Looking at one trajectory: (0,3) leading to various states but not reaching 15. Another went through state 8, then to 4, etc., but didn't reach the goal.

I think I should focus on creating a policy where from each state, the chosen action has a high probability of moving towards the goal or avoiding known dangerous areas.

Perhaps from state 0 (top-left), choosing action 1 (right/down/left) could help. From state 1, maybe action 2 to move down or right.

Alternatively, I could set all states to choose action that tends to move right and down, as those directions lead towards the goal at (3,3).

Wait, in the grid:

- Right increases column index
- Down increases row index

So for each state, choosing actions that increase either row or column would help.

But considering slipperiness, I can't rely on a single action; I have to choose actions that spread the movement towards the goal across possible outcomes.

Perhaps setting all states to action 1 (which allows moving right, down, left) could give a balance between exploring and progressing towards the goal.

Alternatively, for states in the top row, action 0 might be better since it can move down, which is helpful. For example, state 0: action 0 leads to down (state 4), up (stays?), or left (stays). So action 0 could be a good choice to start moving down.

But in the recent params, some had f(params) = 0.05, so maybe changing the policy significantly is needed.

Perhaps I should set all states to action that moves them towards the right and bottom as much as possible.

Another approach: for each state, choose an action that maximizes the expected value based on current knowledge. But without knowing exact transitions or holes, this is tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps setting up a simple policy where each state chooses an action that tends to move in a direction towards the goal, considering their position.

For example:

- From states in row 0 (top), prefer moving down.
- From states in column 3 (rightmost), prefer moving right? But wait, column 3 is already at maximum, so maybe moving up or down is better.
- From other states, choose a combination of right and down.

But considering the slipperiness, each action has three possible outcomes. So setting an action that includes both right/down/left (action 1) might allow some movement towards the goal while exploring.

Alternatively, I could set all states to action 2 or 3, which also include combinations of up, right, down and left, respectively.

Wait, let me think about each action's possible movements:

- Action 0: move down, left, up
- Action 1: move right, down, left
- Action 2: move up, right, down
- Action 3: move left, up, right

So action 1 includes right and down, which are towards the goal. Action 2 includes up and right/down. Action 3 includes left, up, and right.

Hmm, perhaps for states in the top-left quadrant, choosing action 0 (down/left/up) isn't helpful because moving left or up would stay or go back. Maybe action 1 is better as it allows movement towards down and right.

Similarly, for states on the bottom row (states 12-15), since moving down isn't possible, perhaps other actions are better.

But I'm not sure about the exact positions of the holes, so it's challenging to design a perfect policy.

Given that all current policies have low rewards, maybe I should try a completely different approach. For example, setting most states to action 2 or 3, which include right movements, as moving towards the goal is crucial.

Alternatively, perhaps a policy where from each state, the agent has a higher chance of moving towards the right and down by selecting actions that include those directions in their possible outcomes.

Wait, if I set all states to action 1 (right/down/left), then from any state, the agent has a 1/3 chance to move right or down. That could be beneficial for progressing towards the goal while allowing some exploration.

Alternatively, maybe setting even and odd states differently—like alternating actions to cover more ground.

But without knowing where the holes are, it's hard to make precise decisions.

Another thought: Since all rewards are low, I'm in "Explorer" mode. So I should propose a policy that is significantly different from previous ones to gather new information about the environment.

Looking at the most recent params:

params[0]:1; ... f(params):0.05

I could try changing some key states' actions to see how they affect the reward.

For example, set state 14 (3,2) to action 2, which allows moving up, right, or down. Since from 14, moving right would take it to 15, which is the goal. So if I choose action 2 for 14, there's a 1/3 chance of moving right to 15, which would be good.

Similarly, state 10 (2,2) could be set to action 2 or 3 to move towards 14 and 15.

But without knowing if these states are safe, it's risky. Maybe setting a policy where certain key states have actions that directly aim for the goal.

Alternatively, I could try a policy where from each state, the agent has an equal chance of moving right or down, given the action selected. So perhaps choosing actions 1 and 2 in different states to maximize these movements.

Wait, but how can I ensure that without knowing which states are holes?

Maybe start by setting all states to action 1 (right/down/left). Then, from each state, there's a chance to move right or down, which would help progress towards the goal. But if some of these transitions lead into holes, the reward will still be low.

Alternatively, perhaps mix actions in certain states. For example, set even-numbered states to action 1 and odd-numbered states to action 2.

But I'm not sure if that's better. Maybe instead, design a policy where from each state, the agent chooses an action that maximizes the probability of moving towards the goal while minimizing the risk of hitting a hole.

Given all this uncertainty, since we're in "Explorer" mode and previous policies have low rewards, perhaps proposing a completely new configuration is needed to gather more data.

So, I'll try setting all states to action 1. Let's see what that looks like:

params[0]:1, params[1]:1, ..., params[15]:1

But wait, in the recent examples, some had f(params) = 0.05 when using this approach. Maybe it's not effective.

Alternatively, perhaps setting certain states to action 2 or 3 could help.

For example, from state 7 (which is row 1, column 3), moving down would take it to 11, which might be a step closer to the goal. So choosing action 1 for state 7 allows moving right, down, or left. Down leads towards the goal, so that's good.

But without knowing if those states are holes, I can't be certain.

Another idea: From each state, choose an action that has the highest chance of reaching a non-hole state. But without knowing which are holes, it's impossible.

Given all this, perhaps the best approach is to vary the actions across different states to explore various paths and see which ones lead to higher rewards.
