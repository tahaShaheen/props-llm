You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Alright, I need to figure out the best policy parameters for this FrozenLake environment using the provided setup. Let me break down the problem step by step.

First, the environment is a 4x4 grid where each state (0-15) represents a specific position. The goal is to reach state 15, which gives a reward of +1. All other states give a reward of 0. The agent can move in four directions with certain probabilities when taking an action. If the agent steps on a hole (which ends the game), it must explore through previous trajectories.

The policy function takes parameters [params[0], params[1], ..., params[15]], each being 0, 1, 2, or 3. These represent the actions taken when in state 0 to 15 respectively. The goal is to find the set of these parameters that maximizes the expected reward over time.

Looking at the examples provided, I notice that some parameters result in higher rewards (like 1.00) but others are lower. For instance, params[0] = 2 gives a reward of 1.00 for several states, while params[0] = 1 and params[0] = 0 yield lower rewards. This suggests that different actions are associated with varying exploration or exploitation.

To improve the policy, it's important to explore areas with holes (wholes) by reading history. The agent should avoid falling into these, so the policy needs to be robust even when some paths lead to holes.

Considering the slippery environment, each action has an equal probability of 1/3 if not triggered by a hole. This means that without exploration, certain states might get visited more often than others. To address this, I should set parameters such that certain actions are encouraged during exploration, especially in regions with potential holes.

I also observe that some parameters lead to consistent behaviors (e.g., params[0] = 2 always takes action 2), while others vary. This variability helps the agent explore different paths without getting stuck. For instance, params[4] being 1 means when in state 4, it chooses between right, down, and left with equal probability, which allows for more exploration.

Given that the global optimal reward is around None (meaning no fixed target), I need a policy that balances exploration and exploitation effectively across all states. It's crucial to avoid getting trapped in holes since stepping on them ends the game but requires continued exploration.

After analyzing the examples, it seems that actions 2 are often taken, which might mean they're prioritized during exploration or when avoiding immediate rewards. However, I should also consider varying other actions (like action 0) for more flexibility, especially when the agent is near holes.

To find a better set of parameters, I could experiment with different combinations, perhaps focusing on states that are more likely to lead into holes. For example, increasing the chances of taking action 2 in hole-prone areas or adjusting other actions based on observed trajectories from previous episodes.

Additionally, since the reward structure is such that reaching state 15 gives +1, it's beneficial to encourage exploration towards this goal without compromising efficiency. This might involve reinforcing certain actions during states near the goal and others more towards holes.

In conclusion, I should adjust parameters to balance between exploiting known good actions (like action 2) and exploring less frequently visited paths (like those leading into holes). Testing various parameter combinations and evaluating their outcomes will help determine which configuration yields the highest rewards without getting stuck.
