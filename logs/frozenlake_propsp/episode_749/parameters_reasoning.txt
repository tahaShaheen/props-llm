You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help optimize a policy for the FrozenLake environment described here. The goal is to reach state 15 with the highest possible reward, avoiding holes. The agent can move in four directions but because of the slippery nature, each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability.

From the problem statement, the optimal reward should be around 1.0, which suggests that the policy needs to reliably reach the goal without falling into any holes. 

Looking at the provided trajectories and rewards, it seems like most policies are struggling to get high rewards. The top-performing ones have rewards around 0.45, which is still below the target of 1.0. This indicates that either the agent isn't reaching the goal often or is falling into holes frequently.

I need to consider how to design a policy that navigates safely from any starting state to the goal at state 15. Since the environment is 4x4, I can map out safe paths and ensure that each state's action doesn't lead the agent into a hole with any probability.

Looking at the grid layout:
- State 0: (0,0) top-left
- States 3: top-right
- State 15: bottom-right

The holes are not explicitly stated, but from the trajectories, it seems like certain states might be risky. For example, state 4 is in the second row, first column. If the agent takes an action that could lead to a hole, we need to avoid those.

I should design each state's action to maximize the chance of moving towards the goal while avoiding holes. Since actions are probabilistic, the policy needs to choose actions that have a higher probability of leading towards safety and the goal.

One approach is to create a deterministic path towards the goal, but given the slippery nature, we need to account for all possible moves. Alternatively, ensure that from each state, the agent's chosen action has at least one safe move towards the goal.

Looking at some examples:
- The first top param had params[0] = 1, which is 'right' or down/left/up with equal probability. But maybe choosing a different direction could help.
- Another approach is to have states near the bottom-right (like state 12) take actions that push towards 15.

I should think about each state and determine the best action to maximize the chance of reaching 15 without hitting any holes.

For example:
- State 0: Should move right or down, but considering the slippery effect. Maybe choosing 'right' (action 1) which could lead to states 1, 4, or 3. Need to see if those are safe.
- State 1: Perhaps moving right again to approach the goal.
- Continue this reasoning for each state.

But without knowing the exact hole positions, it's challenging. However, I can assume that certain movements might be safer based on typical FrozenLake setups, which usually have holes in states like 5,6,7, etc., but not sure here.

Given the problem's constraints and the need to maximize information gain, perhaps suggesting a policy that tries different actions systematically would help identify safe paths. But since I can't remember previous attempts, each suggestion must be unique.

In this case, maybe setting all states towards the right or down might guide the agent toward the goal. Alternatively, creating loops or detours could avoid holes if they're present in certain areas.

After considering all this, I think setting up a policy where from each state, the action chosen is designed to move towards the goal while considering possible slippery moves that don't lead into known risky states.

So, for each state i, set params[i] to an action that has a higher probability of moving closer to 15 or away from potential holes. For example:
- States in the top row (0-3) should move down or right.
- Middle rows should move towards the bottom-right.
- Ensure that from states near the edges, actions don't lead into holes.

After this analysis, I'll propose a new set of params that differ from previous ones to explore new trajectories and gain more information about safe paths.
