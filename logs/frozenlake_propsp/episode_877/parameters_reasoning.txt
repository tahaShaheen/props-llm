You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment to maximize the reward. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) while avoiding holes. The agent's movement is slippery, meaning each action leads to one of three possible directions with equal probability.

First, I need to understand how the policy parameters affect the agent's path. Each params[i] determines which action the agent takes from state i. Since the environment is 4x4, there are 16 states (0-15), and each has four possible actions (0-3).

Looking at the provided top 5 best-performing params, most of them have f(params) around 0.35 to 0.45, which is below the target of 1.0. This suggests that we're not yet near the optimal solution, so I should focus on exploration rather than exploitation.

In the recent iterations, the policies tried haven't achieved high rewards. The most recent params had f(params) as low as 0.05 and 0.00. Since these are far below 1.0, it's crucial to try new configurations that explore different paths towards state 15.

I notice that in some trajectories, the agent gets stuck or falls into holes quickly. To avoid this, the policy should guide the agent towards safer moves that increase the chances of reaching the goal without falling into traps. For example, from state 0 (top-left corner), moving right (action 1) might be a good start because it leads towards the center, which has more paths.

I need to ensure that each state's action choice doesn't lead the agent into known holes. From previous trajectories, states near the edges or corners are risky. So, actions should generally move towards the goal while avoiding edges.

Let me consider some key states:
- State 0 (top-left): Should move right (action 1) to go towards state 1.
- State 1: Moving down or right could be beneficial. Action 3 might keep it moving right.
- States near the top row should avoid going up, as that would take them out of bounds.
- Middle states (like 4,5,6,7) need to move downwards towards the goal.

I'll try setting params for some critical states:
- State 0: Action 1
- State 1: Action 3
- States in the top row except 0 should avoid going up. For example, state 2 could go right (action 2).
- Middle rows should move down or right towards the goal.

I'll also make sure that from each state, the chosen action doesn't lead to a hole when considering the possible movements. Since the environment is slippery, the agent's next state can be one of three, so choosing actions that have higher probabilities of moving closer to the goal would help.

After mapping out these considerations, I'll propose a new set of params that differ from previous attempts, focusing on right and down movements towards state 15 while avoiding edges.
