You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to help the user find the optimal policy for their FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with a reward of +1, avoiding holes along the way. The agent's actions are slippery, meaning each action has a 33% chance of moving in one of three directions.

First, I need to understand the problem deeply. The user provided details about the environment, including that it's a 4x4 grid with states numbered from 0 to 15. Each state corresponds to a specific grid cell. The agent can move in four directions, but due to slipperiness, each action leads to three possible outcomes with equal probability.

The policy is represented by an array of 16 integers, where each index corresponds to the action taken when in that state. The challenge is to find the optimal set of actions that maximizes the episodic reward, which should ideally be around 1.0.

Looking at the user's interaction process, they provided examples of previous policies and their corresponding rewards. The top-performing policies have rewards ranging from 0.20 to 0.30, which is far below the target of 1.0. This indicates that the current strategies are not effectively leading the agent to the goal.

I notice that in the trajectories provided, many policies get stuck in loops or fall into holes. For instance, some trajectories show repeated states like (0,1) moving to (4,2), then to (8,2), and so on without reaching 15. This suggests that the current policies might not be effectively navigating towards the goal and are instead exploring unproductive paths.

My approach is to consider how each state can best contribute to reaching the goal while avoiding holes. Since the environment is slippery, the policy needs to account for the probabilistic outcomes of actions. For example, in state 0 (top-left corner), choosing an action that has a higher probability of moving towards the goal or away from the hole would be beneficial.

I should also consider the structure of the grid. The agent starts at state 0 and aims to reach state 15. The optimal path likely involves moving right or down, but due to slipperiness, each step could vary. Therefore, each policy should guide the agent in a direction that statistically increases the chances of reaching the goal.

Looking at previous policies, many have high values for actions that might lead towards the center or other non-goal states. To improve this, I need to design a policy where each state's action is chosen to maximize the expected reward, considering the slippery nature and potential holes.

I'll start by mapping out which actions from each state are more likely to move closer to 15 without hitting any holes. For example, in state 0, moving right (action 1) could take the agent towards state 1, but due to slipperiness, it might also go down or left. Similarly, in state 14, which is just above the goal, choosing an action that primarily moves right would be ideal.

I should also analyze the trajectories provided by the user. The recent policies have low rewards, indicating they're not effective. Therefore, I need to propose a new set of parameters that explore different paths and possibly avoid previously tried configurations to gather more information about which actions lead closer to the goal or into holes.

Given the current state of the buffer, where rewards are far below 1.0, I should act as an Explorer, trying out new configurations rather than tweaking existing ones. This means generating a completely new set of parameters that have not been tried before, ensuring that we can gather more data on how different strategies perform in terms of reward.

In summary, the next step is to design a policy where each state's action is selected based on its potential to move towards the goal while considering the environment's slipperiness. I'll create a new set of parameters, making sure they haven't been used before, and submit them for evaluation.
