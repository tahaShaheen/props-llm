You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get the highest possible reward by reaching state 15, which gives +1. All other states give 0, and some are holes that end the episode.

First, I need to understand how the slippery nature of the environment affects movement. Each action has a 33% chance to go in one of three directions, depending on the action taken. For example, choosing action 0 (left) might actually result in moving down, left, or up with equal probability.

Looking at the provided top performing params and their rewards, it seems like most policies are averaging around 0.35-0.45, which is much lower than the target of 1.0. This suggests that the current strategies aren't reliably reaching the goal state without falling into holes.

I notice that in the recent params, some actions might be leading the agent back to previous states or getting stuck in loops, as seen in trajectories like (0,1) repeating or moving between a few states without progress. To improve this, I need to design a policy that avoids such traps and increases the chances of reaching state 15.

I think about how each state's action choices can be optimized. For instance, in state 0 (top-left), choosing an action that has the highest probability of moving towards the goal. Since state 0 is at (0,0), possible moves to reach the right or down would help progress towards state 15.

Looking at the previous params, many have action 1 for state 0. Action 1 allows movement right, down, or left. But since we're in the corner, moving left isn't helpful. So maybe choosing an action that prioritizes right or down movements could be better.

I also consider avoiding states that are holes. The exact positions of the holes aren't specified, but I can infer based on trajectories where agents fell into them. For example, if certain actions lead to immediate termination, those should be avoided.

To maximize information gain, since we're in iteration 1291, it's time to tweak parameters slightly rather than explore new ones. So I'll focus on adjusting the best-performing params to see if a slight change can improve reward.

I decide to modify state 0's action from 1 to 3. Action 3 allows moving left, up, or right. From (0,0), moving right is better for progress towards the goal. Also, I'll adjust other states to ensure that when the agent moves down from certain positions, it doesn't fall into a hole.

After making these adjustments, I compile the new params array, ensuring each state's action is chosen to maximize the chance of reaching the goal without falling into traps.
