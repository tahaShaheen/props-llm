You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy parameters for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward by reaching state 15 without falling into any holes. The environment is 4x4 with slippery movements, meaning each action has a 33% chance of going in one of three directions.

First, I need to understand the structure of the grid and which states are holes or goals. From what's given, state 15 is the goal (bottom-right corner). The other holes aren't specified, but based on common FrozenLake setups, I can assume that some states like 5, 6, 7, etc., might be holes, but without explicit info, it's tricky. So, the policy needs to avoid actions leading into these holes.

Looking at the previous parameters and their rewards, it seems most policies are getting around 0.25-0.45 reward on average, which is below the target of 1.0. That suggests we're not yet close to the optimal solution. The best so far got 0.45, but that's still low.

The recent parameters tried include a mix of different actions, but they might be leading into holes or taking too long to reach the goal. For example, in one trajectory, the agent went from (0,3) to (1,3), which might be a hole. Another trajectory got stuck moving around without reaching the goal.

To improve, I should consider policies that more directly approach state 15 while avoiding known dangerous states. Maybe setting up actions that push towards the right and down directions where possible. Since the environment is slippery, each action has some randomness, so the policy needs to account for that by choosing actions that have a higher probability of moving closer to the goal.

For instance, in state 0 (top-left), taking an action that moves right or down would be beneficial. Similarly, states near the bottom-right should push towards the goal. Also, I need to ensure that from any state, the chosen action doesn't lead into a hole with high probability.

I recall that in some optimal policies for FrozenLake, greedy approaches are used where actions lead directly towards the goal, considering possible slips. So, I might set up params such that each state's action is directed toward moving right or down, depending on their position, to increase the chance of reaching state 15.

Additionally, since previous attempts have low rewards, it's probably better to explore more by trying different actions rather than sticking with what's been tried before. This would help in finding a path that avoids holes and reaches the goal more efficiently.

Putting this together, I'll design a new set of parameters where each state is assigned an action that generally moves towards the right or down, depending on its position, to navigate closer to the goal while minimizing the risk of falling into holes. This should maximize the probability of reaching state 15 and thus increase the episodic reward.
