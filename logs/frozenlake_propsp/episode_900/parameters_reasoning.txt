You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Okay, so I need to help find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The environment is a 4x4 grid where each state represents a cell. The agent can move in four directions: left, down, right, up. However, because the lake is slippery, when the agent takes an action, it moves to one of three possible directions with equal probability. Each action leads to three possible moves.

The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) for a reward of +1, and all other states give 0 reward except the holes which end the episode immediately.

The policy is defined by an array 'params' where each element corresponds to the action taken in that state. The challenge is to find the optimal set of actions across all states (0-15) such that the agent maximizes its expected reward, avoiding the holes.

Given that I'm supposed to act as a stateless optimizer, my approach should be to explore and then exploit based on previous performance. Since we're at iteration 900 out of 5000, it's relatively early in the process, but some top-performing policies have already been found with rewards around 0.35-0.45.

Looking at the 'TOP 5 BEST PERFORMING PARAMS', I see that several states are set to move towards the goal or avoid holes. For example, state 7 is often set to action 2 (down), which might help in navigating towards the goal.

In the recent params provided, many have low rewards (0.00), suggesting that perhaps their policies are either getting stuck or falling into holes frequently. To improve this, I should propose a policy that avoids such traps while still pushing towards state 15.

I notice that some states aren't being handled optimally. For example, in the top-left corner (state 0), action 1 is chosen in many cases, which might not be the best path. Maybe trying different actions here could help.

Also, states near the edges or holes need careful handling to avoid falling into them. Actions that lead towards safe paths while inching closer to state 15 would likely yield better rewards.

Given that I can't remember previous attempts, each proposal must stand on its own. So, I'll aim for a policy that systematically navigates from each state towards the goal without leading the agent into known holes based on the trajectories provided.

Perhaps setting up a grid-based strategy where each state's action leads in a direction that generally moves towards state 15 while considering the possible slippery nature of the environment. For example, encouraging right and down movements when possible to reach the goal faster.

I'll try assigning actions in such a way that from any given state, the agent has a higher probability (due to the slippery nature) of moving closer to the goal or avoiding holes. This might involve setting specific actions for each state that statistically increase the chances of reaching 15 without stepping on holes.

After considering all this, I'll draft a new 'params' array where each state's action is chosen to move towards the goal while minimizing the risk of falling into a hole based on the provided trajectories.
