You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I need to find the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment using a reinforcement learning approach. The user provided some parameters and wants me to figure out the best values from 0, 1, 2, or 3 to set. 

First, I should understand the problem setup. The state is an integer between 0 and 15 representing positions in a 4x4 grid. Each action leads to new states with certain probabilities. When an action is taken, all three possible directions are equally likely if the agent is at a specific state.

The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right corner) which gives a reward of +1. Other states give 0. There are some holes that can trap the agent, so I need to explore through previous experiences to avoid falling into them.

The policy is an array of 16 parameters where each parameter corresponds to the action chosen for each state (from 0 to 15). Each parameter is a value between 0 and 3. The goal is to find values for these such that f(params), which is the total episodic reward, is maximized.

Looking at the examples provided, several sets of parameters yield different rewards. For instance, one set gives a reward of 1.00, another 0.25 or even 0.20. The most recent examples have lower rewards, suggesting that higher values might not always be better in certain states.

I recall that the optimal policy for this environment typically involves preferring certain actions over others to reach the goal safely. From what I remember, it's generally best to move down when possible, avoid moving up if on the top row, and explore other areas if stuck. 

But given the slippery environment, each action can lead to any of the three directions with equal probability (each 1/3). This makes exploration necessary because without experience, the agent might get trapped in holes.

Let me consider some possible parameter sets. For example:

- params[0] = 2 means moving down is chosen for state 0.
- params[1] = 2 would mean moving right is chosen for state 1.
But I'm not sure how this affects each state, so maybe other combinations are better.

Another approach is to set higher values where it's beneficial. For instance, if moving left is good in certain positions and right is good elsewhere, that could be leveraged with different parameters.

Wait, but the reward function only gives 1 for the goal state, others zero. So the agent should prioritize reaching state 15 as quickly as possible without being stuck.

I think a common policy is to move down when possible on the top row and rightmost column, avoid moving up if in certain areas, etc. But with parameters varying from 0 to 3, I have to balance which actions are more likely.

Maybe testing different combinations where action 1 is used for the goal state and others as necessary elsewhere could be effective. Or perhaps a policy that explores all directions equally but reinforces paths leading to the goal.

Wait, considering the examples given, some parameters result in higher rewards. For instance, one set has f(params) = 0.25. Maybe the optimal is around there. But I should try different combinations and see which yields better rewards.

After thinking through, perhaps a strategy where action 1 (right) is chosen when possible, except on certain states, could be effective. Alternatively, using action 3 (down) whenever down leads to a path towards the goal.

I think the best approach would involve experimenting with different combinations around 0.25 or higher, but without being too aggressive since it might risk falling into holes. It's a balance between exploration and exploitation.
