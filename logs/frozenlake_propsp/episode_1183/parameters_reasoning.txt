You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The agent is on a 4x4 grid where each state can transition to one of three possible states with equal probability due to the slippery nature. The goal is to reach state 15 (bottom right corner) and avoid holes which end the episode.

From the problem statement, I know that the policy is an array of 16 actions (each being 0-3), mapping each state to an action. The challenge is to propose a new set of parameters that hasn't been tried before, aiming to maximize information gain for the next iteration.

Looking at the provided data, the best performing policies have f(params) around 0.45. That's still far below 1.0, which suggests we're not yet exploiting effectively but maybe exploring is needed.

The trajectories show that some policies get stuck or loop without reaching the goal. For example, one trajectory goes (0,2) multiple times and doesn't progress towards state 15. This indicates that certain actions might be leading to dead-ends or loops.

I need to think about which states are crucial for reaching the goal. The key is likely to get from the start (state 0) to the end (state 15). So, the paths through states like 4,5,6,7 (second row), and then moving towards 8-11, 12-15 are important.

Considering the slippery nature, each action taken might not lead directly where intended. For instance, choosing to move right from state 0 (action 1) could result in moving down, left, or staying up with equal chance. But if we choose an action that increases the chances of moving towards state 15 despite the slipperiness, it's better.

Looking at the best policies provided, they tend to have certain actions in specific states. For example, in state 0, some choose action 1 or 2, which might be trying to move right or up. However, since the environment is slippery, moving right from state 0 (action 1) could lead to down, left, or up.

I think a potential strategy is to have actions that push towards the goal direction as much as possible. For example, in states closer to the goal, choosing actions that would generally move the agent towards it even if they don't always land there.

Now, considering that I need to propose a new set of params without repeating previous ones, I should look for patterns in the best-performing policies and vary one or two actions to see if it improves performance.

Looking at the top5 best params, most have params[0] as 1 or 2. Let's consider changing some other states. For instance, state 7 (end of second row) should probably move down to get closer to the goal. Similarly, state 4 (start of second row) should move right.

I might try setting certain states to specific actions that push towards the goal more directly. Also, ensuring that there are no immediate holes being stepped on is crucial, so some states need cautious actions.

Given all this, I'll propose a new set of params where each state's action is chosen to maximize the chance of moving towards the goal while avoiding loops. For example:

- States in the first row (0-3) might benefit from moving right or down.
- Middle rows should push towards the bottom-right direction.

I need to make sure that this new set hasn't been tried before, so I'll adjust a few key states' actions and see if it leads to a better trajectory without repeating previous params.
