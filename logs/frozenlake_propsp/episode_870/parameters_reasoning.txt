You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. So, from what I understand, it's a 4x4 grid where the agent can move in four directions: up, down, left, right. But because of the slippery nature, each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) for a reward of +1. All other states give 0 except if you step into a hole, which ends the episode.

The user has provided some top performing params and recent ones along with their rewards. The highest reward so far seems to be around 0.45, but the goal is to get close to 1.0. So, I need to think about how to structure the policy to maximize the chances of reaching state 15 without falling into holes.

Looking at the top params, it seems like certain states are being directed in specific ways. For example, the first param (state 0) is set to action 1, which according to the description would move down, right, or left with equal probability. But since the agent can't control where exactly it goes, maybe setting actions that generally guide towards the goal while avoiding holes.

I also notice that some trajectories end quickly, like (0,1) leading to state 4 and then 8. That might be a path towards the goal. So perhaps for states near the top-left, directing towards moving down or right could help move closer to the bottom-right.

But I need to make sure that the policy doesn't lead into holes. Holes are states that end the episode when stepped on, but their exact locations aren't specified. From the trajectories, maybe some of them indicate which states are holes. For instance, if an agent steps onto a state and immediately ends, it's probably a hole.

Given the most recent params had low rewards (0.20 and 0.00), maybe I should try to explore more rather than exploit what's working slightly better but not enough. So perhaps changing some of the policies in critical states where they might be leading into dead-ends or holes.

Looking at state 15, it's already the goal, so that action doesn't matter because once you reach it, the episode ends. Similarly, for other terminal states like when falling into a hole, their actions don't affect the outcome as well.

I should think about creating paths that have multiple ways to reach the goal while avoiding holes. Maybe setting up policies where each state directs towards moving towards the right or down, which are the directions towards the goal.

Also, considering the slippery nature, it's more about increasing the probability of eventually reaching the goal rather than deterministic steps. So, choosing actions that on average move closer to the goal would be beneficial.

Perhaps for states in the top row (0-3), directing right or down; middle rows (4-7 and 8-11) directing right or down as well, but also considering their positions to avoid moving into holes.

But without knowing exactly where the holes are, it's a bit tricky. So maybe focusing on general movement towards the goal and ensuring that in some states, the action doesn't lead towards known dead ends based on previous trajectories.

For example, if certain states when taking an action often end up in a hole or don't progress towards the goal, adjusting those actions might help.

Looking at one of the recent params where all rewards were 0, it's possible that the policy was leading into holes frequently. So, perhaps changing some of these to take different actions could avoid such outcomes.

I think I'll try modifying a few key states:

- For state 0 (top-left), maybe action 1 or 2 to move right or down more.
- For state 3, which is top-right, directing down might help move towards the goal without going left into possible holes.
- States in the middle should perhaps have actions that guide towards the right or down based on their position.

Overall, I need a policy that balances moving towards the goal while minimizing the chance of falling into holes. Maybe testing some variations from the current top policies but adjusting certain states to see if they can avoid traps and reach the goal more efficiently.
