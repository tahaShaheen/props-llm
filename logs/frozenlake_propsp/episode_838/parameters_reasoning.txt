You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out the best policy parameters for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to maximize the reward by reaching state 15 without falling into any holes. Let me start by understanding the problem thoroughly.

The environment is a 4x4 grid where each state can transition probabilistically based on the action taken. Each action has three possible outcomes with equal probability due to the slippery nature of the environment. The challenge is to find a policy that avoids the holes and efficiently navigates towards the goal.

First, I need to know which states are holes. From the trajectories provided, some holes can be inferred. For example, in one trajectory, the agent steps into state 15, which is the goal. In another trajectory, stepping into state 3 leads to a hole because the episode ends there. Similarly, other states like 0 and 4 might be dangerous based on how the trajectories end.

Given that the optimal reward should be around 1.0, I need a policy that reliably reaches state 15 in most episodes. From the previous parameters, some are performing better than others but none have reached 1.0 yet. So, I should focus on tweaking these parameters to improve the success rate.

Looking at the top-performing params, they seem to be taking certain actions that might be leading towards the goal but with too many detours or getting stuck in loops. For example, one trajectory goes (0,1) → (4,2) → (8,2), which is moving down and then right, perhaps not directly toward state 15.

I should consider actions that push the agent closer to the goal more effectively. Maybe for certain states, changing the action could lead to a higher probability of reaching the end without falling into holes.

Since I can't remember previous attempts, each suggestion must be unique and aim to explore new paths or optimize existing ones based on the current buffer. The key is to balance exploration and exploitation by selecting parameters that either open up new trajectories (exploration) or slightly adjust high-reward policies (exploitation).

I think for state 0, choosing action 2 (up) might be better because it could help avoid immediate holes. Similarly, in state 1, action 3 (left) could lead towards the right path without getting stuck.

Wait, but looking at the previous best params, some are using actions that seem to loop or not progress effectively. Maybe adjusting certain states' actions to push more directly toward the goal would help. For example, states near the bottom-right might benefit from different action choices.

I need to make sure each proposed parameter set is unique and hasn't been tried before. Also, I should aim for params that have a higher chance of reaching state 15 quickly without getting stuck in holes or cycles.

After considering all these factors, I'll propose a new set of parameters where certain states take different actions, focusing on moving towards the goal while avoiding known holes.
