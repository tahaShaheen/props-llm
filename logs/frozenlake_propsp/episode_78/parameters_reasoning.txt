You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I know the environment is a 4x4 grid where each cell is a state from 0 to 15. The goal is state 15, which gives a reward of +1, while all others give 0. There are holes that end the episode if stepped on.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 values, each indicating the action (0-3) for each state. The slippery nature means actions can lead to three possible directions with equal probability. So, the agent's actual movement isn't guaranteed; it has some randomness.

Looking at the provided examples, all the top-performing policies have low rewards around 0.10 or less. That suggests that current strategies aren't effective in reaching the goal consistently. The average reward is far below the target of 1.0, so I'm likely in the exploration phase—trying out different policies to gather more data rather than optimizing a near-optimal one.

I need to propose a new policy that's distinct from previous ones to maximize information gain. Let me analyze some of the existing params:

- Previous params often have certain patterns, like alternating actions or repeating sequences. For example, some might move right (action 1) or down (action 0) frequently.
- To explore more effectively, I should vary the actions in a way that hasn't been tried before. Maybe using different combinations or focusing on specific directions.

Let me consider each state and what action would be most beneficial:

1. **State 0 (top-left corner):** Moving right (action 1) or down (action 0) could help, but considering the slippery nature, maybe choosing an action that has a higher chance of moving towards the goal without falling into holes.

2. **States near the edges:** These are more likely to have holes, so actions should be cautious—perhaps preferring movements away from known hole positions.

3. **Goal state (15):** Once reached, no further actions needed, but ensuring that states leading to 15 have actions that can reach it without falling into holes.

Given the previous trajectories, some paths lead to loops or getting stuck in certain areas. To avoid this, I should design a policy that encourages exploration towards the goal while minimizing risks of falling into holes.

I'll try creating a policy where each state has a unique action that hasn't been seen much before. For example:

- Alternate between right and down actions for states in the top row.
- Use up and left actions to navigate around potential holes in the lower rows.

Let me draft some specific changes:

- **params[0]: 1** (right)
- **params[1]: 3** (left, but maybe this could help move towards other directions due to slipperiness)
- **params[2]: 0** (down)
- Continue this pattern for each state, ensuring a mix of movements.

Wait, I need to make sure that these actions don't lead the agent into holes. Let me cross-reference known hole positions. For example, certain states like 5,6,7 in rows might be holes. So, actions near those should avoid moving towards them.

After considering all this, here's a proposed new policy:
</think>

params[0]: 3, params[1]: 2, params[2]: 1, params[3]: 0, params[4]: 3, params[5]: 2, params[6]: 1, params[7]: 0, params[8]: 3, params[9]: 2, params[10]: 1, params[11]: 0, params[12]: 3, params[13]: 2, params[14]: 1, params[15]: 3
