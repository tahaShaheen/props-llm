You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Okay, so I need to help find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me try to understand the problem first.

The environment is a 4x4 grid where each state is represented by numbers from 0 to 15. The goal is to reach state 15, which gives a reward of +1. All other states give 0. But there are holes that end the episode if stepped on. The agent's actions are slippery; when it takes an action, it moves in one of three directions with equal probability.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 parameters, each corresponding to a state (from 0 to 15). Each parameter can be 0, 1, 2, or 3, representing the action taken from that state. The challenge is to find the optimal set of these parameters that maximize the episodic reward.

From the interaction history provided, I see that the user has given several examples of policies and their corresponding rewards. The top-performing policies have average rewards around 0.25 to 0.35. The goal is to reach a reward close to 1.0, which suggests that we need a policy that can reliably reach state 15 without falling into any holes.

Looking at the trajectories provided, many of them either end in a hole or get stuck in loops. For example, some policies lead the agent to keep moving left or right without making progress towards the goal. Others might take paths that are too risk-prone near the edges where holes are present.

To maximize information gain and avoid previously seen parameters, I should propose new parameter configurations that explore different paths. Since the current best rewards are below 1.0, we're in the exploration phase. So, I need to suggest a policy that takes actions leading towards state 15 while avoiding known hole positions.

Analyzing the grid, the goal is at (3,3), which is state 15. To get there, the agent should generally move right and down from the starting point (0,0). However, due to the slippery nature, each action has a probability of moving in three directions. So, the policy needs to guide the agent towards the goal while considering the possible movements.

Looking at state 0 (top-left corner), taking action 1 (right, down, left) might be better than action 0 or others because it allows for movement right, which is needed to reach the goal. Similarly, other states should have actions that nudge the agent towards state 15, considering the possible drifts from the slippery movements.

I also need to ensure that the proposed policy doesn't lead the agent into holes. For example, certain edges or corners might have holes, so actions from those states should avoid moving into directions where there's a high risk of falling into a hole.

Based on this reasoning, I'll propose a new set of parameters that guide the agent towards the goal while minimizing the chances of falling into holes. Each parameter will be chosen from 0 to 3 based on their position and the possible movements that increase the likelihood of reaching state 15.
