You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment with the given parameters. The goal is to reach state 15, which gives a reward of +1, while avoiding holes. Since the environment is slippery, each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability.

First, I need to understand how the environment works. It's a 4x4 grid where each state corresponds to a specific cell. The agent can move in four directions (up, down, left, right), but due to slipperiness, each action has a 1/3 chance of moving in three different directions.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 actions, one for each state. My task is to determine the optimal set of these actions that maximize the episodic reward.

Looking at the provided data, the top-performing policies have rewards around 0.25, which is still below the target of 1.0. This suggests that none of them are consistently reaching the goal without falling into holes.

I notice that in the recent iterations, most policies aren't performing well, with some even getting zero reward. This indicates that the current strategies might not be effectively navigating towards the goal or avoiding traps.

To improve, I should consider a strategy that prioritizes moving towards the goal while minimizing the risk of falling into holes. Since each action is probabilistic, the policy needs to choose actions that have the highest chance of leading towards state 15 without stepping on holes.

For example, states closer to the bottom-right corner (state 15) should have policies that push them right or down. States in the upper rows might benefit from moving down to approach the goal. However, due to slipperiness, sometimes it's better to choose actions that average out the possible moves towards the desired direction.

I also need to ensure that each state's action doesn't lead into a hole with high probability. This might involve mapping which states are holes and adjusting the policy accordingly, but since I don't have explicit information on where the holes are, I have to infer based on previous trajectories.

Given the current top policies, it seems that some are getting stuck or falling into loops. To break this, I should propose a policy that introduces more variance in movement from certain states, possibly exploring new paths rather than exploiting known but suboptimal routes.

In summary, my next step is to adjust the policy parameters to encourage a more direct path towards state 15 while reducing the chances of hitting holes. This might involve setting actions that, on average, move the agent closer to the goal and vary the directions slightly to avoid traps based on previous outcomes.
