You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment with a 4x4 grid and some holes. The agent is in a slippery environment where each action has three possible outcomes. The goal is to reach state 15 (right bottom) with the highest reward.

First, I'll start by looking at the provided parameters. The current params array is [0, 2, 3, 1]. From the top-performing examples, it seems that using a combination of actions can lead to better rewards without falling into the holes.

The first example has params[0] = 2, which means when in state 0 (top-left), action 2. That leads to up, right, or down. The second parameter is 3, so from state 1, action 3 (left, up, right). The third parameter is 1, leading to left, down, or up again.

I notice that when in certain states, using a combination of actions can navigate the grid more effectively without falling into holes. For example, sometimes taking an unexpected direction might lead to exploring different paths, avoiding hard cuts.

Since the current params are [0,2,3,1], let me see how each state is handled:

- State 0: action 2 (up) → which could take it back to state 2 or down to state 4.
- State 1: action 2 leads to right, but from state 1, moving right would lead to state 3. However, in the first example, params[1] is 0, so that seems different.

Wait, I think I should analyze each state and see which actions lead towards the goal without risking stepping into a hole. For instance, state 2 (up-right) might take action 2 again to up or right, but maybe choosing another action there could be better if it leads away from the hole.

After considering various options, it seems that mixing different actions can help in navigating around obstacles. Using a combination of left, right, and down moves each state allows for more flexible exploration, which might reduce chances of falling into holes or getting stuck.

So, I'll adjust the params to allow a mix of possible actions from each state. Maybe setting some parameters higher so that they have more options but also ensuring that the agent can still reach the goal without overshooting.
