You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me try to understand what's going on here.

First, the environment is a 4x4 grid where each cell is a state from 0 to 15. The goal is to reach state 15, which gives a reward of +1. All other states give 0, except when you fall into a hole, I guess that ends the episode with no reward.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 actions (each being 0-3). Each action taken has a 1/3 chance to go in one of three directions due to the slippery nature. So, for each state, we need to choose an action that maximizes the probability of reaching the goal without falling into a hole.

Looking at the history provided, the best performing policies have rewards around 0.2 or lower. That's way below the target of 1.0, so I think we're in exploration mode since we're not close to the optimal reward yet.

I need to propose a new set of params that's different from all previous ones and can help us learn more about the environment. Maybe I should vary some actions to see which paths lead closer to the goal or avoid holes.

Let me look at some of the trajectories. For example, one policy had a trajectory going (0,1) then (4,2), then (8,2). It didn't reach the goal but maybe there's a way to adjust the policy to push it towards state 15 instead.

Another thought: since the environment is slippery, choosing actions that generally move towards the right or down might be better because they can lead towards the bottom-right corner. For example, if in state 0 (top-left), taking action 2 (which could go up, right, or down) might help move towards higher-numbered states.

Wait, but I should make sure that the actions don't lead into holes. The problem is I don't know where the holes are exactly because they weren't specified. So, I need to design a policy that avoids moving into any hole states by making safe choices based on previous trajectories.

Looking at one of the previous policies: params[0]: 2; ... which led to (0,3) and then some moves but didn't reach the goal. Maybe adjusting the initial actions could help.

I think I'll try setting the policy so that from each state, it prefers moving right or down as much as possible because those directions lead towards the goal. For example, in the first few states (0-3), choosing action 2 or 3 might be better.

Also, considering the slippery nature, even if we choose an action, there's a chance to move in other directions. So, maybe having multiple paths that can reach the goal is essential.

Let me draft some params:

- For state 0 (top-left), I'll choose action 2 (which allows up, right, down). Maybe this increases the chances of moving towards higher-numbered states.
- For state 1, perhaps action 3 to allow left, up, or right. Wait, but if it's in state 1, maybe right is better to move towards higher numbers.

Wait, maybe I should map each state and decide which actions could lead closer to the goal without falling into holes. But since I don't know where the holes are, perhaps focusing on a general direction is better.

Alternatively, looking at some of the previous policies that performed well (like around 0.2), they might have had certain patterns. Maybe tweaking those slightly can help find a better reward.

But given that all rewards so far are below 1.0, it's better to explore more, so I shouldn't tweak existing ones but create entirely new params.

Let me try setting the policy such that from each state, it chooses an action that tries to move towards the right or down as much as possible, considering the available actions.

For example:

- States in row 0 (0-3): choose actions that can go down or right.
- States in row 1 (4-7): same, but also perhaps moving towards right.
- Continue this until reaching state 15.

But I'm not sure about the exact mappings. Maybe a better approach is to set each state's action to one that has a higher probability of leading towards the goal without falling into holes.

Wait, another idea: in some cases, taking an action that loops or stays in place might avoid holes but could also prevent reaching the goal. So, I need to balance exploration and exploitation.

Since the previous attempts have low rewards, it's crucial to try new policies that might find a path to the goal without falling into holes. Maybe focusing on making sure that from certain states, you don't get stuck in loops or fall into holes by choosing better actions.

Given all this, I'll construct a new params array where each state's action is chosen to push towards the right or down as much as possible.
