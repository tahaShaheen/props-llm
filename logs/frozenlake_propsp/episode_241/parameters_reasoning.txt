You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment where the agent is a bit slippery. Let me think through how I would approach this.

First, I remember that in reinforcement learning, the goal is to maximize the cumulative reward by choosing the best action each state. Since the agent can move left, right, up, or down with equal probability when it's not on the edges, but sometimes moves are restricted because of the slippery environment.

The policy is represented as an array where each value between 0 and 3 corresponds to the action (up, down, left, right) taken in that state. I need to find parameters params[0] through params[14], each set from 0 to 3.

Looking at the top performing params provided earlier, like [2: params[0], 1, etc.], they have different combinations. But since we can't look at previous results, I'll have to reason it out.

The agent should explore through holes by reading trajectories. This means that if the agent steps on a hole (state 15 in this case), it's only when it reaches it that it gets terminated. So, the policy needs to avoid such states as much as possible or, if forced to enter them, find a way out.

Given the slippery nature of the environment, each action choice leads to different probabilities because sometimes the agent will choose an unintended direction. For example, taking action 0 from state (0,1) could lead it to move up with probability 1/3 instead of left or down equally.

I think I'll start by considering which actions are more likely to lead towards a hole and adjust the policy accordingly. If certain actions tend to take the agent into holes, maybe those should be avoided or given lower probabilities.

Wait, but in the provided params, some have higher values (like 2) for certain actions, implying they might encourage going up or left. I need to ensure that these don't inadvertently lead to falling into a hole. Since the goal is state 15, which is at the bottom right corner, avoiding this state is crucial.

I should probably look for parameters where higher numbers (like 3) correspond to actions that are less likely to end up in holes. For example, action 2 is supposed to pick from up, down, and right equally. Maybe if I set params[2] lower, the agent has a better chance of avoiding it.

Alternatively, maybe some combinations balance the exploration properly. For instance, params[0] being 1 instead of 2 could mean sometimes choosing left or up more, but still not too often leading down to a hole.

I also need to consider that the agent should exploit when possible and explore when necessary. If certain actions are consistently better in terms of reward without risking falling into a hole, they should be given higher probabilities.

Another angle is to think about the grid structure. The top-left corner (0,0) needs to avoid action 2 as much because sometimes it could lead down or right. So params[2] might need to be lower there.

I'm also wondering if mixing up the actions more in some areas can improve exploration without over-reliance on exploitation. For example, having a mix of left and up actions might prevent the agent from getting stuck near holes.

Perhaps I should try different combinations where certain actions are prioritized in specific states to avoid falling into holes. This might involve setting higher probabilities for actions that lead away from potential holes or lower them when necessary.

I think the key is to balance between action selection that reduces risk (facing a hole) and maximizing immediate reward, especially on clear paths to the goal. Since all other states give 0 reward, focusing on efficiently reaching state 15 without entering any holes is crucial.

So, I'll try parameters where higher numbers are given more weight in certain critical actions. Maybe params[2] (for right/left/down) should have lower values because sometimes moving down or right could lead to a hole. But if the policy prefers avoiding holes when possible, perhaps these can still be set higher.

Overall, experimenting with different parameter combinations and seeing how they affect trajectory exploration and reward is essential. I'll start by setting params[0] to 1, which might balance up and left actions more often without being too exploratory. That way, the agent avoids certain dangerous areas while still trying to exploit clear paths.
