You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to find the optimal policy in this FrozenLake environment using an episodic reward function and a neural network-based policy gradient approach. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, the environment is the standard 4x4 grid called FrozenLake. The agent starts at (0,0) and needs to reach the goal at (15). Each state gives a reward of +1 if it's not the goal, otherwise zero. There's also a hole on some tiles which end the game if stepped onto.

The policy is a function that maps each state (represented as 0-15) to an action (0=down, 1=right, 2=up, 3=left). The current policy parameters are initialized as [1.0 for all], meaning all actions have equal probability. We need to optimize these parameters using the policy gradient method.

The goal is to maximize the expected cumulative reward. Since it's a grid-based state, each state can be represented by an index from 0 to 15. The reward function f(params) is what we're optimizing over multiple iterations.

Looking at the provided examples of params and their corresponding rewards:
- Some configurations yield a reward of 1.0, which is good but not the highest possible.
- Others have lower rewards, possibly because they explore more or are less efficient.

The current policy parameters start at [1.0 for all], so it's a symmetric policy without any exploration. To find the optimal policy, we need to adjust these parameters to encourage certain actions based on the state distribution and reward history.

One approach is to use Monte Carlo sampling: evaluate the policy in multiple episodes (each time from scratch) to collect data about which states are visited more often and what rewards they yield. This data can guide adjustments to the policy's probabilities to maximize expected reward.

Alternatively, using a Q-learning style update based on state visitation counts might help, where actions with higher visitation rates get higher probabilities assigned.

But perhaps a better method is to consider reinforcement learning techniques like actor-critic or neural networks for approximating action policies. Since we're optimizing a policy function represented as parameters, a neural network acting as an estimator could map states to probabilities of each action.

Given that the state space is small (16 states), it's feasible to compute the expected reward directly by sampling multiple episodes from the current policy and using those samples as training data for the policy approximation. This would allow us to iteratively update the policy parameters based on the average rewards observed, encouraging actions that lead to better outcomes.

I should also consider entropy in the policy to prevent overly greedy policies that might explore too much, which could be beneficial but might interfere with exploration.

Another thought is about using a model-based approach where we simulate trajectories from the current policy to estimate the best action for each state. This would directly target improving the policy without just sampling.

But given the small size of the problem and manageable number of iterations (400), perhaps it's feasible to implement a simple Monte Carlo method by running multiple episodes, each time using the current policy, recording transitions, and then retraining the parameter estimates based on these collected data.

So, in terms of steps:
1. For each iteration, start from scratch with the current parameters.
2. Run enough episodes (like 50 or more) from this policy to collect state visitation counts and average rewards.
3. Use this data to update the neural network estimating the optimal action for each state based on visitation counts and expected reward.
4. Repeat until convergence, tracking f(params) at each step.

This seems manageable. So I should plan to implement a Monte Carlo approach, perhaps using two separate networks: one to estimate the best actions based on visited states, and another to optimize the policy parameters that guide these estimates.
