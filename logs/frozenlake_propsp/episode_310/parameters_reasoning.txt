You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help optimize the policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get a reward of 1 by reaching state 15, which is the bottom-right corner. But there are holes that can end the episode if stepped on.

First, I remember that in the original FrozenLake without slipping, the optimal policy would be deterministic and direct towards the goal. However, here the environment is slippery, meaning each action has a 33% chance to go one of three directions. So the policy needs to account for this uncertainty.

Looking at the provided top params, most have low rewards around 0.15-0.25, which suggests that we're not getting close to the optimal reward of 1.0. The recent policies also aren't performing well, with some even yielding zero reward. This indicates that our current strategies might not be effective enough.

I need to think about how to structure a policy that maximizes the chances of reaching state 15 without falling into any holes. Since each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability, the policy should guide the agent in a way that statistically increases its chance of moving towards the goal.

Maybe I should consider making certain states have actions that push the agent more towards the right or down, as those are the general directions needed to reach state 15. For example, states near the top-left (0) should try to move right or down. States in the middle might need to balance their movements depending on their position.

I also noticed that some trajectories end quickly because of holes. So it's crucial for each policy to avoid actions that could lead into these holes with high probability. For instance, if a state is adjacent to a hole, the action chosen should minimize the chance of stepping into it.

Since we're in an iteration where the rewards are still low, I might need to explore more diverse policies to gather more information about which paths are safe and effective. Maybe varying the actions across different states could help identify better reward opportunities.

I think a good approach is to structure the policy so that each state has an action that statistically moves towards the goal as much as possible given the slipping nature. For example, setting certain states to always move right or down, while others might alternate between these directions to account for the uncertainty.

Let me try to outline a potential policy:

- Start from the top-left (0). Moving right or down makes sense.
- In state 1, moving right would take us closer to the goal, but considering slipping, maybe moving down is safer.
- States in the first row should aim to move right as much as possible since that's the direction towards the goal.
- Middle states should have a mix of right and down actions to navigate through without falling into holes.

Wait, I also need to consider the slippery nature. So each action has three possibilities. Therefore, the policy needs to choose actions that maximize the expected reward considering all possible outcomes.

I think a greedy approach where each state's action is chosen based on the maximum expected value would be ideal. But since we're not remembering previous attempts, I need to make an educated guess based on general knowledge of such grid environments.

Another thought: perhaps using dynamic programming or Q-learning principles to model transitions and rewards could help determine the best actions for each state. But without memory, I can't store these values, so I have to rely on general patterns.

I recall that in the original FrozenLake, a policy gradient method or value iteration would be used, but here with slipping, it's more complex. So maybe a deterministic policy where each state chooses an action that has the highest probability of leading towards the goal.

Let me try constructing such a policy:

- States 0 (top-left) should move right to go towards state 1.
- State 1: moving down might take us closer or cause slipping, so perhaps alternating between right and down.
- Similarly, for other states, actions should be chosen to push the agent towards the goal while avoiding holes.

But without knowing exactly where the holes are, it's tricky. Maybe making a policy that avoids certain movements in specific areas.

Alternatively, focusing on getting as close to state 15 as possible by ensuring that each step statistically moves closer. For example:

- States near the top should move right or down.
- Middle states should alternate between right and down to navigate around potential holes.

Wait, I think a standard optimal policy for this slipping version would be more complex but could still be determined by considering all possible transitions.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to set up a policy where each state chooses an action that has the highest probability of moving towards the goal, given the slippery nature. For example:

- States 0: right (action 1)
- State 1: down (action 3 or 0)
- And so on for other states.

But I'm not sure about this without testing. Maybe a more balanced approach where each state has an action that covers multiple directions to increase the chance of moving towards the goal.

In conclusion, after considering all these factors, I think setting up a policy where each state's action is chosen to statistically move towards the goal as much as possible while avoiding holes would be optimal.
