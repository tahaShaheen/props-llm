You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. It's a 4x4 grid with slippery movements and some holes. The goal is to reach state 15, which gives a reward of +1, while avoiding the holes that end the episode.

First, I need to understand how the agent moves. Since it's slippery, each action has three possible outcomes. For example, if the agent chooses action 0, it can move down, left, or up with equal probability. The same goes for other actions—each has a 1/3 chance of going in one of three directions.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 numbers (params), each corresponding to the action taken in states 0 through 15. My task is to find the optimal set of these params that maximizes the average episodic reward, which should be around 1.0 if we've found a good solution.

Looking at the provided data, the top-performing policies have rewards ranging from 0.45 down to 0.25, and the most recent ones are even lower, as low as 0.05 or 0.00. This suggests that the current policies aren't very effective, possibly because they're not efficiently navigating towards state 15 without falling into holes.

Since I'm supposed to act as a stateless optimizer, I can't remember previous attempts, so each suggestion must be based solely on maximizing information gain for the next iteration. If rewards are far below 1.0, I should explore new configurations; if they're close, I should tweak the best ones slightly.

The trajectories show that many policies get stuck or fall into holes. For example, one trajectory goes (0,3) and then gets stuck moving right three times without reaching the goal. Another policy ends up in a loop near state 8 but doesn't proceed further.

I need to propose params that guide the agent towards state 15 while avoiding known holes. Since I don't have memory, I'll look for configurations that haven't been tried yet and could potentially explore new paths or improve upon existing ones.

One approach is to ensure that each state's action leads the agent closer to state 15 as much as possible. For example, states near the bottom-right (like 12, 13, 14) should move right or down if possible. However, due to slipperiness, I need to choose actions that increase the probability of moving towards the goal.

Looking at state 0 (top-left), which action is best? If it chooses to move right or down, but since it's slippery, it might not go directly. Maybe choosing an action that has a higher chance of moving in the desired direction. Action 1 for state 0 allows movement right, down, or left, which could be beneficial as moving right is towards the goal.

Similarly, for state 15 (the goal), I don't need to change anything since it's terminal. But other states near the bottom and right should prioritize actions that move closer to 15.

I also notice that in some trajectories, agents get stuck in loops or fall into holes because they're not careful about their movement choices. So, the policy needs to minimize such risks by choosing actions that avoid holes when possible.

Given all this, I'll propose a new set of params where each state's action is chosen to maximize the chance of moving towards 15 while considering the slippery nature and avoiding known holes. This means adjusting several states' actions, especially those in the lower-right quadrant, to push towards the goal.
