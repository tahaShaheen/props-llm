You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to set the policy parameters for the FrozenLake environment to maximize the reward. The goal is to reach state 15, which gives a +1 reward, while avoiding holes that end the episode.

First, let's understand the environment. It's a 4x4 grid, so there are 16 states. Each state corresponds to a specific cell. The agent can move in four directions, but because of the slippery nature, each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability. For example, if the agent chooses action 0, it could go down, left, or up.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 numbers, where each number represents the action taken from that state. The actions are 0, 1, 2, 3. The challenge is to find the optimal set of actions for each state so that the agent reaches the goal as often as possible without falling into holes.

Looking at the previous examples and trajectories provided, I can see that some policies have resulted in rewards around 0.10 to 0.25. The top-performing ones have slightly higher rewards but still far from the optimal 1.0. This suggests we need a better strategy.

Since the environment is slippery, the agent's path isn't straightforward. To maximize success, each state should have an action that increases the probability of eventually reaching state 15 without hitting a hole. 

I notice in some trajectories that agents fall into loops or get stuck near holes. So, it's crucial to choose actions that lead away from these dangerous states and towards the goal.

Let me think about key states:

- State 0 (top-left corner): The agent can move down, right, or up with action 0, but since moving up isn't possible, maybe moving right is better.
- States near the bottom-right (like 13,14) should have actions leading towards state 15.

I also need to ensure that the chosen actions don't lead into holes. For example, certain states might be near holes, so their policies should avoid directions leading to those holes.

Maybe a greedy approach would work best here, where each action is chosen to maximize the chance of moving closer to the goal while avoiding known dangerous areas. However, since the environment has stochastic movements, it's tricky to plan exact paths.

I'll consider setting actions in such a way that from each state, the agent moves towards the right or down as much as possible, which are the directions leading towards the goal. But I have to account for the slippery nature, meaning each action can lead in three directions with equal probability.

Perhaps, for most states, choosing an action that has one of the desired directions (right or down) and two alternative safe ones could help. For example, in state 0, action 1 might be better because it includes right as a possible move.

I should also look at the trajectories provided to see where agents are failing and adjust their policies accordingly. If an agent is getting stuck near a hole, I can change the policy for that state to choose actions leading away from it.

Given all this, I think setting most states to action 1 or 2 would be beneficial because they include right and down movements. For example, action 1 includes moving right, which is helpful in navigating towards the goal. However, some states might need different actions depending on their position relative to the goal and holes.

I'll proceed by assigning each state an action that has a high probability of moving it closer to the goal without risking falling into holes. This likely means prioritizing actions 1 and 2 for most states, adjusting as needed based on proximity to the goal.
