You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get an episodic reward of around 1.0, which means reaching state 15 without falling into any holes. From what's given, the current policies aren't performing well—most have rewards below 0.45, and some even have negative rewards because they fell into holes.

First, I need to understand the environment better. The grid is 4x4, with slippery movements meaning each action has a 1/3 chance of going in three possible directions. Holes are present, but their exact locations aren't specified yet. So, the policy must avoid these holes by learning from previous trajectories.

Looking at the recent policies and their rewards, it seems that most strategies result in either falling into holes or getting stuck in loops without reaching the goal. For example, some trajectories show repeated actions leading to the same states, which probably means they're not making progress towards state 15.

Since I'm supposed to maximize information gain as a stateless optimizer, and given that rewards are still low, I should focus on exploring different strategies rather than tweaking existing ones. This means proposing new parameter configurations that haven't been tried before, especially those that might lead the agent closer to the goal or avoid holes.

I notice that in some previous policies, actions 1 and 3 were more common for certain states. Maybe trying a mix of these with other actions could help. For example, maybe in state 0 (top-left corner), instead of always taking action 1, which might lead down or right with equal probability, perhaps another action would be better.

I should also consider the structure of the grid and how to navigate towards state 15 optimally. The shortest path from state 0 is likely moving right twice and then down twice, but given the slippery nature, this isn't straightforward. So, the policy needs to guide the agent in a way that increases the probability of reaching the goal without getting stuck.

Another thought: perhaps certain states have higher risks of falling into holes, so their policies should be set to safer actions that minimize those risks. For instance, if state 1 is a hole, then action 0 (which might move down or left) could be dangerous. But since I don't know the exact hole locations, I need to infer them based on trajectories.

Looking at one of the top-performing policies, params[0] was set to 1. Maybe trying different actions for state 0 and seeing how it affects the trajectory would help. If action 2 is chosen for state 0, perhaps it increases the chance of moving up or right, which could be beneficial.

I should also ensure that each proposed policy is unique from previous ones to gather new information about which states are safe and which lead to rewards. This way, over iterations, we can build a better map of the environment.

In summary, my next step is to propose a new set of parameters where I change some actions in key states like 0, 4, 8, etc., to different values from 0-3, ensuring they haven't been tried before. This should help explore new trajectories and possibly find a path that avoids holes and reaches the goal more efficiently.
