You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right) without falling into any holes. From the history provided, it looks like most policies are yielding low rewards around 0.2 to 0.3, and some even zero. My task is to suggest a new set of parameters that might help improve the reward.

First, I need to understand the environment better. The grid is 4x4 with states from 0 to 15. Each state can transition to three other states with equal probability due to the slippery nature. Holes are present but their exact locations aren't specified, so the policy must avoid actions that could lead to them.

Looking at the top performing params, they seem to have a mix of actions, but none reach close to 1.0 reward. The recent attempts have varied, with some policies not moving much (like staying in place) and others trying different combinations. The trajectories show that many get stuck or fall into holes quickly.

I think I should focus on creating a policy that moves towards the goal while minimizing the risk of falling into holes. Maybe prioritizing right and down actions but also considering how the slippery nature affects movement.

Let me try to structure it:

1. **States near the bottom-right (states 12-15):** These are close to the goal. From state 14, moving right leads to 15, which is good. From state 13, moving down or right should help.

2. **Middle states:** States like 8-11 need actions that can lead towards 12-15 without risking holes.

3. **Top and left states:** Starting from the top-left (state 0), actions should move towards the goal direction.

I'll try assigning actions based on this logic. Maybe for each state, choose an action that has a higher chance of moving closer to the goal, considering the possible slippery transitions.

For example:

- State 0: Moving right or down would help, but since it's top-left, maybe move right (action 1).
- State 1: Similar, perhaps move right.
- Continue this pattern towards the bottom-right.

But I need to ensure that each action doesn't lead into a hole. Since holes aren't specified, I'll have to make educated guesses based on trajectories. For instance, in state 5, maybe moving down is safer than left if previous attempts fell into a hole when taking left.

Putting it all together, I'll assign actions step by step from each state towards the goal, considering possible safe paths.
