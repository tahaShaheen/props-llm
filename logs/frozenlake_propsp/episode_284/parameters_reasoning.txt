You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, let's try to figure out the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get from the top-left corner (state 0) to the bottom-right corner (state 15). The agent can move in four directions: left, down, right, or up, each with equal probability when taking an action.

First, I'll look at the provided params array where most entries are either 1.0 or 2.0. This setup suggests that certain actions might be more favorable based on their distribution across the grid. Let me go through the params values step by step to understand the policy.

Starting from state 0: action is 0 (down). From state 0, possible moves are down, left, and up. Since all three directions are equally likely, I should choose an action that optimizes the chances of reaching the goal quickly or avoiding pitfalls. Moving right seems counterintuitive here because it would take us away from the goal. So, choosing between down and up might be better.

For state 1: action is 1 (right). This means moving right, left, or down equally. If I'm at state 1, the optimal strategy could involve prioritizing moves that lead towards the goal without getting stuck in a hole. Right seems like it would move me closer to the exit, so maybe choosing right here makes sense.

State 2: action is 2 (up). Up from state 2 takes me back to state 3, which might be a hole or another problematic area. Since up leads back to a potentially bad state, I should avoid this action unless it's absolutely necessary.

Moving on to the higher-numbered states, each has its own set of actions. For example, in state 4 (down-left), action is 0 (down). From here, moving down takes me to state 7, which might be a hole. So I need to ensure that sometimes I take other directions to avoid getting stuck.

I also notice patterns where certain states are visited more frequently with specific actions. For instance, from state 6 (right-middle), action is 1 (left). This suggests that moving left could help in navigating through some tricky areas without being caught off guard.

Considering the global optimal, I need a policy that avoids stepping into holes and efficiently progresses toward the exit. The current setup with most actions at 1 or 2 seems too rigid. For example, state 4 is visited by action 0 (down) from state 7. But if sometimes moving up (action 2) could be better to navigate through any possible holes.

I should test some other combinations, like having more 'up' and 'right' actions in certain regions to ensure that the agent can always find a safe path back towards the goal without repeatedly stepping into holes. Also, considering all transitions from each state is crucial to determine which action yields better returns when combined with the rest of the policy.

In summary, my initial approach has some issues where sometimes moving away from the exit could lead to higher rewards, but not necessarily. I need to adjust the policy so that it's more adaptive and avoids being caught in a hole, while still exploring other paths when necessary. Maybe having more 'up' and 'right' actions in regions with lower transition rates towards holes would be beneficial.
