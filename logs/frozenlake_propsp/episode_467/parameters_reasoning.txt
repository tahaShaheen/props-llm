You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help optimize the policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with a reward of +1, avoiding holes along the way. The environment is slippery, meaning actions don't always lead directly to intended states; instead, there's a probability the agent moves in one of three directions.

First, I need to understand the current situation. From the provided data, the best policies so far are giving around 0.30 reward on average, which is significantly below the target of 1.0. This suggests that the current policies aren't effectively navigating towards the goal without falling into holes too often.

Looking at the trajectories, some agents are getting stuck in loops or moving away from the goal. For example, one trajectory went (0,1) then to (4,2), which is deeper into the grid but not necessarily towards 15. Another policy got stuck near state 8 and kept oscillating without progress.

Since the global optimal reward should be around 1.0, I need a policy that almost always reaches the goal. This likely requires careful mapping of each state's action to avoid holes and steadily move toward the target.

Given that the environment is slippery, the policy needs to account for possible drifts in movement. For instance, if the agent intends to move right (action 1), it has a 33% chance to go down or left instead. Therefore, each action's selection should increase the probability of eventually reaching state 15 while minimizing the risk of falling into holes.

I recall that in such grid-based environments, policies often involve moving towards the goal as much as possible and using actions that have higher chances of progressing toward it despite the slipperiness. For example, always choosing to move right or down when possible might be a good strategy since those directions generally lead closer to state 15.

However, I need to consider the slippery nature. So, for each state, selecting an action that maximizes the chance of moving towards the goal, even if it's not guaranteed. For example, from state 0 (top-left corner), moving right or down would be beneficial. Similarly, from other states, actions should guide the agent toward the bottom-right.

Looking at previous policies, some have a mix of actions without a clear direction. To improve, I might need to standardize the policy so that each state's action leads predominantly towards the goal. This could involve setting all non-terminal states to choose right or down actions, depending on their position.

But wait, considering the movement probabilities, certain actions from specific states have a higher chance of leading closer to 15. For example, from state 3 (top-right), moving down would lead to state 7, which is further along but still not the goal. From state 7, moving right would take it to 11, and so on.

I should also avoid actions that might lead into holes. Some states are holes themselves, like maybe 5 or others. So, the policy must ensure that the agent never takes an action that could land it in a hole. But since the exact locations of the holes aren't specified here, I need to infer based on previous trajectories.

From the provided examples, agents have fallen into holes after certain moves, which suggests that some states are traps. So, the policy should avoid actions that might lead into those states. For example, if moving left from state 1 leads into a hole, then in state 1, it's better to choose an action that doesn't risk going left.

Putting this together, I need to create a deterministic policy where each state has a specific action that moves the agent closer to 15, considering the possible drifts. For instance:

- From states near the top, prefer moving down.
- From states on the left side, prefer moving right.
- Avoid actions that could lead into holes, perhaps by learning from previous trajectories which actions led to failures.

However, without knowing exactly where the holes are, I have to rely on the fact that previous policies that led to higher rewards (like 0.30) were somewhat better but still not optimal. So, perhaps tweaking those parameters slightly could help improve performance.

Another approach is to use a greedy strategy with respect to reaching the goal, ensuring that each action increases the likelihood of eventually getting closer to state 15. This might involve setting actions in such a way that even with the slipperiness, the agent tends toward the goal over time.

Given all this, I think the next step is to propose a policy where most states have an action that directs towards the right or down, avoiding any actions that could lead into holes based on previous experience. This would likely maximize the chance of reaching state 15 while minimizing risks.
