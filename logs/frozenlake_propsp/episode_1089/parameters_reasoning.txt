You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

Do NOT output anything else. No explanation, no reasoning, nothing.



LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15, which gives a reward of +1, while avoiding holes that end the episode with 0 rewards.

From the problem description, each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability due to the slippery nature of the grid. So, I need to design a policy that maximizes the chances of reaching the goal without falling into any holes.

Looking at the top 5 best performing params, they all have an average reward around 0.35-0.45. The optimal should be around 1.0, so there's room for improvement. That means I need to explore more effective policies.

The most recent four params are not doing well, with rewards as low as 0.00 and 0.25. So, maybe the current best isn't great, and we need to try different actions in critical states.

I notice that state 15 is the goal, so it's optimal to stay there once reached. But how do we get there?

Looking at the trajectories:

- The top params' trajectory often goes from (0,1) through various states towards 15 but might be getting stuck or falling into holes.
- Some recent policies are not even reaching the goal, which suggests they're failing early.

I should focus on creating a policy that directs the agent towards state 15 without getting stuck. Maybe setting certain actions in key states to push more towards right and down directions, considering the slippery nature.

For example:

- In state 0 (top-left), moving right or down could help move towards the goal.
- In state 3, which is top-right, moving down would be better.
- States along the bottom row should try to move right towards state 15.

I also need to ensure that in states near the edges, actions don't lead into holes. Maybe some states need specific actions to avoid dangerous moves.

Given that previous policies didn't reach high rewards, I'll propose a new policy that emphasizes moving right and down, with some flexibility based on current positions.

Let me draft params where each state is assigned an action that generally pushes towards the goal:

- States in the top row: move right (action 1) or down (action 0)
- Middle rows: prefer right (action 2 or 3) or down
- Bottom row: move right (action 2,3) to reach 15.

I'll assign these actions systematically across all states, ensuring that from any state, the agent has a path towards 15 without falling into holes.
