You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to help optimize the policy for the FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with a reward of +1, avoiding holes along the way. The slippery nature means each action can lead in three directions randomly.

First, looking at the top params provided, they all seem to have low rewards around 0.15 or lower. That's much below the target of 1.0, so I'm in "Explorer" mode, meaning I should try new configurations to gather more information rather than tweaking existing ones.

The recent policies tried didn't perform well either, with even some getting stuck or falling into holes. For example, one policy kept looping between states without progressing towards the goal.

I need to think about which states are near the goal and how to guide the agent there effectively. Maybe adjusting actions in key positions like the states close to 15 could help. Also, ensuring that from any state, the chosen action doesn't lead into a hole with high probability is crucial.

Considering the slippery nature, each action has three possible outcomes. So, the policy should choose actions that maximize the chance of moving towards the goal while minimizing the risk of falling into holes. For instance, states near the bottom right (like 12-15) should push the agent towards state 15.

Looking at the grid, state 15 is the target. So, for the state before it (state 14), choosing an action that can reach 15 when possible is important. Similarly, states in row 3 (8-11) need actions that help move right or down towards 15.

I'll try to set params for states near the goal to push towards 15. For example, setting state 14 to action 2 might help as moving up from 14 would take it to 10, but considering the slipperiness, maybe another action is better.

Wait, let's clarify the movement based on actions:

- Action 0 leads to down, left, or up.
- Action 1 leads to right, down, or left.
- Action 2 leads to up, right, or down.
- Action 3 leads to left, up, or right.

So, for state 14 (which is in the third row, second column), choosing action 3 might be better because it can go left, up, or right. From 14, moving right would take it to 15, which is the goal. So if params[14] is set to 3, there's a chance of reaching 15.

Similarly, for state 13 (third row, first column), action 2 could be good as it can go up, right, or down. Moving right from 13 takes it to 14, which is closer to the goal.

I should ensure that states in the lower rows are set to move towards the right and down, while upper rows might need to move down to reach the lower rows eventually.

Let me try setting some key states:

- params[0]: Moving down (action 0) would take it to state 4.
- params[1]: Maybe action 3 to go left, up, or right. But being in top row, moving down is probably better, so maybe action 0 or 1.

Wait, but I'm trying to maximize the chance of reaching the goal. Perhaps a more aggressive approach is needed.

Let me think about each state's optimal action:

- States in the bottom row (12-15): Focus on moving right towards 15.
- States in the third row (8-11): Move down or right to get closer.
- States in the second row (4-7): Move down to reach the third row.
- States in the first row (0-3): Move down to start descending.

So, for state 0: action 0 (down) leads to 4.
State 1: action 1 (right or down). Maybe action 1 to have a chance to move right to 5 or down to 7.
Wait, no, moving right from 1 would take it to 2? Or is the grid structured differently.

Wait, I need to clarify how the states map. Each row has four states:

Row 0: 0 (top-left), 1, 2, 3 (top-right)
Row 1: 4,5,6,7
Row 2:8,9,10,11
Row3:12,13,14,15

So, moving right from state i takes it to i+1 if possible. For example:

From state 0 (row 0, column 0), moving right would go to 1.
From state 1 (row 0, column 1), moving right goes to 2, and so on.

Similarly, moving down from row 0 takes it to row 1, same column. So:

- From state 0 (0,0) down is 4
- From state 3 (0,3) down is 7

Moving up from row 1 would take it back to row 0.

Given that, the optimal path likely involves moving right and down towards the goal.

But considering the slippery nature, each action has a 1/3 chance of going in any direction. So, the policy needs to choose actions that have the highest probability of eventually reaching the goal without falling into holes.

So, for most states, choosing an action that can move towards the right or down is better.

Let me try setting:

- For all states not in the bottom row (12-15), set their action to either 0 (down), 1 (right or down), 2 (up, right, down), or 3 (left, up, right). 

But considering that moving right is essential for reaching 15 from earlier rows.

Wait, perhaps setting all states except the bottom row to choose actions that have a high chance of moving down or right.

For example:

- For states in rows 0, 1, and 2 (states 0-11), set their action to 1 (right, down, left) or 2 (up, right, down). Action 1 can move right or down, which are both useful. Action 2 includes up, but that might take it back.

Alternatively, action 3 for states in columns where moving right is possible could help.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to set all non-bottom row states to action 1 or 2 to maximize the chance of moving towards the goal.

But I need to ensure that from any state, there's a path that can reach 15 without hitting a hole.

Looking back at previous policies, some had low rewards because they fell into holes. So, the policy should avoid actions that lead to holes with high probability.

Given that, perhaps for certain states near holes, the action should be chosen carefully.

But since I don't have information on where the holes are, I need to infer them based on trajectories.

Wait, in the initial problem statement, it says the agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectories. So, from the history of trajectories, we can see which states lead to falls.

Looking at the recent trajectories:

One trajectory was (0,3) (1,3) (1,3)... leading to a fall. That suggests that state 1 might be near a hole or the action taken led to a hole.

Another trajectory: (0,0) (4,1) (8,1) etc., which didn't reach the goal.

So perhaps states like 1 and others are holes or lead to them.

Given that, I need to adjust policies to avoid actions that would lead to these problematic states.

For example, if state 1 is a hole, then from state 0, taking action 1 (which can go right) might be risky. So perhaps setting params[0] to 0 (down) instead of 1.

But in the top policies, some had params[0] as 1 and performed poorly. Maybe state 1 is a hole?

If that's the case, then from state 0, action 0 (down to 4) would be safer.

Similarly, for other states, choosing actions that don't lead to holes.

But without explicit knowledge of which states are holes, it's tricky. So, I'll proceed by trying to set actions that generally move towards the goal and avoid what seems like dangerous paths based on previous trajectories.

Let me attempt a new policy where:

- For state 0: action 0 (down) to go to 4.
- State 1: action 3 (left, up, or right). But if moving left from 1 leads back to 0, which might be safe. Or maybe action 2 for up and right.
Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's try setting most states in the earlier rows to move down, except when near the edges.

For example:

- States 0-3: action 0 (down)
- States 4-7: action 1 (right or down)
- States 8-11: action 2 (up, right, down) but maybe better to go down
Wait, no. From state 4 (row 1, column 0), moving down would take it to 8.

Alternatively, setting states in row 1 and above to move down towards the lower rows, which are closer to the goal.

So:

- For states 0-3: action 0 (down)
- States 4-7: action 0 or 2. Action 0 moves down to 8, action 2 can go up, right, or down.
Wait, but moving down from state 4 would take it to 8.

Alternatively, set states in row 1 and above to move towards the goal by going down as much as possible.

So:

- params[0] = 0 (down)
- params[1] = 0
- ...
- Similarly for all non-bottom states: action 0 or another that moves down.

But I'm not sure if this would maximize the chance to reach the goal.

Alternatively, perhaps using a more varied approach where some states push right and others down.

Given the uncertainty and previous attempts, I think it's best to try a policy where most states in earlier rows choose actions that have a mix of moving down and right, while avoiding risky moves that lead into holes as inferred from past trajectories.

After considering all this, I'll propose a new set of params where:

- For state 0: action 0 (down)
- State 1: action 3 (left, up, or right). But since left would take it back to 0, which might be safe.
Wait, but in the previous attempts, taking action 1 from state 0 led to issues. So maybe setting params[0] to 2.

Alternatively, perhaps setting all states except for those near the goal to action 1 or 2 to encourage movement towards the right and down.

But I'm not entirely sure, so I'll proceed with a cautious approach.

Step-by-step explanation:

I decided to set the policy to encourage movement towards the goal (state 15) while avoiding actions that might lead into holes. For states near the bottom row, I chose action 2 or 3 to have a chance of moving right towards the goal. Earlier states are set to move in directions that can eventually reach the lower rows where the goal is located. This approach aims to balance exploration and exploitation by varying actions to find the optimal path without falling into known holes.
