You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to help the user optimize a policy for the FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with the highest possible reward, avoiding holes along the way. The user has provided some details about the environment and the current best policies they've tried so far.

First, I need to understand the setup. It's a 4x4 grid where each cell represents a state from 0 to 15. The agent can move in four directions, but because of the slippery nature, each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability. Holes are present, and stepping on them ends the episode.

The user mentioned that the global optimal reward should be around 1.0, which means the policy needs to reliably reach state 15 without falling into holes. The current best policies have rewards averaging around 0.15, which is quite low. So, there's a lot of room for improvement.

Looking at the recent parameters and trajectories provided, it seems like many policies are getting stuck or falling into loops. For example, some trajectories show repeated states, indicating that the agent isn't making progress towards the goal. This suggests that the current policies aren't effectively navigating towards state 15.

I need to think about what a good policy should look like. The optimal strategy would be one that increases the chances of moving right and down, as those are the directions leading towards state 15. However, because of the slippery nature, each action has a probability of going in three different directions. So, the policy needs to choose actions that statistically guide the agent towards the goal while avoiding holes.

In the current top parameters, many have alternating actions between right (action 1) and up (action 3), which might not be the most efficient. For example, action 1 leads to moving right, down, or left, while action 3 leads to left, up, or right. Maybe a more consistent direction would help.

I should consider designing a policy where states closer to the goal are set to move directly towards it, and for other states, choose actions that statistically push the agent in the right or down directions. For instance, setting states near the top-left (like state 0) to action 1 (right/down/left), which has a higher chance of moving right, but also some risk. Alternatively, using action 2 (up/right/down) might sometimes move up, which isn't helpful from state 0.

Wait, actually, from state 0 (top-left corner), the possible moves are down, left, or up for action 0; right, down, left for action 1; up, right, down for action 2; and left, up, right for action 3. So, to move towards the goal, which is at state 15 (bottom-right), from state 0, moving right (action 1) gives a chance to go right, which would take the agent closer.

But considering the slippery nature, each action has three possible outcomes. For example, choosing action 1 from state 0 gives a 1/3 chance of moving right, down, or left. Moving right is good, but moving down takes the agent away from the goal (to state 4), and moving left would take it to state 3, which is also not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe choosing action 2 for some states could be better because it includes up, right, and down. From certain positions, moving up might lead out of bounds or into a hole, so that's risky.

I need to map each state to the best possible action considering the slippery nature and the position of holes. But since I don't have the exact location of the holes, I'll assume they're at states 5, 6, 7 (second row), as those are common in FrozenLake problems, but not always.

Given that, for each state, I need to choose an action that maximizes the chance of moving towards the goal without stepping into a hole. For example:

- State 0: Choose action 1 (right) because it has a chance to move right.
- States 1 and 2: Maybe action 3 or 1 to push towards the right or down.
- States in the bottom row (12-15): Focus on moving right until state 15.

But without knowing the exact holes, this is tricky. Alternatively, perhaps a greedy approach where each state's policy points towards higher-numbered states would work, but considering the slippery nature, it needs to be probabilistic.

Another approach is to consider that with optimal play and avoiding holes, the agent should have a 100% chance of reaching state 15 if there are no obstacles. But since there are holes, the policy must navigate around them.

Looking at the recent parameters provided, many of them seem to cycle or not progress towards the goal. For example, one trajectory is (0,0) repeating and then moving down. This suggests that from state 4, the agent might be taking an action that doesn't move it closer.

I think a better approach would be to set each state's policy to prefer actions that statistically increase the likelihood of moving towards state 15 while avoiding holes. For example, in the first row (states 0-3), choosing right or down actions. In the second and third rows, depending on position, choose right or down.

But without knowing where the holes are, it's hard to be precise. However, based on standard FrozenLake setups, holes are typically in states like 5, 6, 7, and 12, but I'm not entirely sure here.

Given that the user provided some recent parameters with low rewards, perhaps trying a different approach would help. Maybe setting all policies to action 3 (which has right as an option) could increase the chance of moving towards state 15. Alternatively, alternating actions to explore more might help in avoiding holes.

Wait, but each action choice is fixed per state, so it's not about exploration during training but setting a deterministic policy that maximizes expected reward.

Another thought: maybe some states should be set to stay still? But no, the available actions don't include staying still; they're all moves. So, each action will always cause a move in one of three directions.

Given that, perhaps for each state, we can compute which action leads to the highest probability of eventually reaching state 15 without hitting a hole.

But since I don't have exact knowledge of the holes, I'll assume standard positions. Let's say the holes are at states 5, 6, 7 (second row) and perhaps 12.

In that case, from state 4 (which is in the second row), choosing an action that doesn't lead down would be better because moving down might take the agent into a hole.

Wait, but in standard FrozenLake, the holes are in states 5,6,7, and 12. So, if the agent is at state 4 (second row, first column), taking action down would move to state 8 or 9 or something else? Wait no, each move from a state can lead to adjacent cells.

Actually, let's map out possible moves:

From any state i (r,c), moving up would take it to (r-1,c) if within bounds, else stays. Similarly for other directions.

But since the grid is 4x4, moving beyond borders might not be allowed—probably, the agent stays in place or wraps around? Wait, no, in standard FrozenLake, I think moving out of bounds would result in staying in place or maybe being absorbed as a hole.

Wait, the user didn't specify what happens when you move outside the grid. But since they mentioned that stepping on holes ends the episode, perhaps moving beyond the grid is not allowed and leads to a hole or stays.

Assuming that moving out of bounds is treated as a hole (i.e., ending the episode), we need to make sure policies don't lead the agent off the grid.

Given all this complexity, I think the best approach is to set each state's policy to an action that statistically moves towards the goal without leading into known dangerous areas. For example:

- States in the first row (0-3): prefer right and down actions.
- States in other rows: move towards the bottom-right.

But again, without exact hole positions, it's challenging. Alternatively, perhaps a policy where every state chooses action 1 (right) or 2 (up), but that might not be optimal.

Wait, looking at the previous best parameters, some have a pattern of alternating actions between right and up, which could be causing loops. Maybe instead, setting a consistent direction would help.

Perhaps for even-numbered states, choose action 1 (right), and for odd-numbered states, choose action 0 (down). That way, the agent moves in a diagonal manner towards the goal.

Alternatively, since each action has three possible outcomes, maybe setting policies that increase the chance of moving right and down more often would help. For example, action 1 gives a higher chance of moving right, which is good for states on the left side.

Another idea: use dynamic programming to compute the optimal policy based on expected rewards. Each state's value depends on its possible next states, considering the slippery moves and hole probabilities. But since I can't do that here, I'll have to make an educated guess.

Considering all this, perhaps setting each state to action 1 (right) or 2 (up) might be better than the previous attempts. Alternatively, maybe a combination of right and down actions.

Wait, but without knowing where the holes are, it's hard to avoid them. So, perhaps a safer approach is needed that reduces the risk of falling into holes.

In conclusion, I'll propose a policy where each state chooses an action that statistically moves towards the goal while minimizing the chance of hitting a hole. For example:

- States in the first column (0,4,8,12): choose down to move towards the next row.
- Other states: choose right to move towards the goal.

But since actions are probabilistic, maybe choosing action 1 for most states and action 3 for others could help.

After considering all this, I'll suggest a new set of parameters that deviate from previous attempts, focusing on moving right and down consistently. For example:

params[0]:1; params[1]:1; params[2]:1; ... etc., setting each state to action 1 or 3 to push towards the goal.
