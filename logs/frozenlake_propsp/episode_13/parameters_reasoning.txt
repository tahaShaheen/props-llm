You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get a reward of 1 by reaching state 15 without falling into any holes. The tricky part is that the agent's actions are slippery, meaning each action has three possible outcomes with equal probability.

First, I need to understand the grid setup. It's a 4x4 grid where states are numbered from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). Each state can transition to three other states based on the action taken and the environment's slipperiness.

Looking at the problem, the policy is defined by an array of 16 actions (each being 0-3), where each index represents a state. My job is to propose this array in each iteration, aiming for the highest possible reward.

From the provided examples, I can see that most policies aren't performing well yet, with rewards around 0.05. The best ones have trajectories that either reach the goal or get stuck. For example, one trajectory goes from (0,1) to (4,2) and then to (8,2), but doesn't reach 15.

I think a good starting point is to design policies that move towards the goal as much as possible while avoiding holes. Since the environment is slippery, I need actions that have a higher probability of moving in the desired direction without leading into dangerous states.

Let me consider each state and decide which action would maximize the chance of moving closer to 15 or staying safe. For instance, state 0 (top-left) should probably move right (action 1), but considering the slipperiness, it might go down, left, or right with equal chance. But since the goal is at 15, which is right and down from here, maybe moving right or down is better.

However, looking at the trajectories provided, many end up in loops or don't reach the goal. So I need to find a policy that can navigate effectively without getting stuck.

Another approach is to use the fact that certain states are closer to the goal than others. For example, state 14 is just one move away from 15, so ensuring that state 14's action leads directly to 15 would be ideal.

I also notice that some of the previous attempts lead into loops, like staying on state 0 repeatedly. That suggests that the policies might not have a clear path towards the goal and get stuck in certain states.

Given that I'm supposed to act as an optimizer now because rewards are low, I should tweak the best-performing policies slightly. The top policy had f(params) of 0.05 with a trajectory going through (0,1), (4,2), (8,2). Maybe adjusting some actions in those states can lead closer to the goal.

I think focusing on states near the goal is crucial. For example, state 12 is just above 15. If I set action for state 12 to move right or down, it might help reach 15.

Also, avoiding holes is essential. From the environment description, some states are holes, but their exact locations aren't specified. However, based on trajectories, certain actions lead to failures, so I should avoid those paths.

In summary, my approach would be:

1. For each state, determine which action has the highest chance of moving towards the goal or staying safe.
2. Ensure that states near the goal have actions leading directly there.
3. Avoid actions that lead into known dangerous trajectories.
4. Propose a new policy by adjusting the best-performing ones slightly to explore better paths.

After considering all this, I'll create a new params array where each state's action is chosen to maximize progress towards 15 while avoiding loops and potential holes.
