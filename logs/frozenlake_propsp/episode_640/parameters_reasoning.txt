You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let's break down what I know.

First, the environment is a 4x4 grid, and each state can be represented by numbers from 0 to 15. The goal is state 15, which gives a reward of +1. All other states give 0, but some are holes that end the episode immediately. 

The policy is defined by an array of 16 actions (params[0] to params[15]), each being 0-3 corresponding to up, right, down, left? Wait, no—looking back, actually:

Wait, in the problem statement, it's specified that:
- Action 0 leads to [down, left, up]
- Action 1 leads to [right, down, left]
- Action 2 leads to [up, right, down]
- Action 3 leads to [left, up, right]

So each action has three possible directions with equal probability. The environment is slippery, so the agent doesn't always move in the direction it chooses.

The challenge is to design a policy that maximizes the reward by avoiding holes and reaching state 15 as often as possible.

Looking at the history provided:

- The top-performing policies have f(params) around 0.3, which is low but higher than others.
- The most recent policies all performed very poorly (f(params): 0.0 or 0.05), suggesting they either fell into holes or didn't reach the goal.

Since we're at iteration 640 and have a max of 5000, I need to decide whether to explore more or exploit what's working so far.

Given that the rewards are still below 1.0, according to the strategy, I should be an "Explorer". This means I should choose a new policy distinct from previous ones to gather more information about which states lead to holes and which don't.

Looking at the recent policies, they all seem to have similar issues—maybe not moving towards state 15 effectively or getting stuck in loops. So, perhaps changing the actions for key states could help.

For example, maybe some states near the goal aren't taking optimal paths because their current action isn't leading them directly towards 15. Alternatively, certain states might be causing the agent to fall into holes because their action choices are risky.

I should consider what each state's best move would be. For instance:
- State 0 (top-left corner): Maybe moving right or down is better.
- State 3: Being on the top row, it's adjacent to the hole perhaps.
- Mid states like 7 and 8 might need careful handling.

I'll also check if any of the recent policies had actions that led directly into holes. For example, if a state near a hole chose an action that has a high probability of moving into it, changing that action could prevent failure.

Since I can't remember previous attempts (stateless), each new policy must be novel. So I'll try modifying a few key states' actions to see which direction might work better without falling into holes.

Let me think about how the agent moves in different scenarios. For example, state 15 is the goal—so once there, it's done. States near it should aim to move towards it.

I need to ensure that from each state, the chosen action has a high probability of avoiding holes and progressing towards the goal. Since the environment is slippery, taking an action that, on average, moves closer to the goal would be better.

Perhaps I can set certain states to always choose actions that have a higher chance of moving right or down (towards 15) but also avoid the holes.

Looking at the recent policies, maybe some had too many left or up movements which could lead away from the goal or into holes. So adjusting those to more right/down might help.

Also, considering the slippery nature, choosing actions that have multiple possible directions but with a higher chance of moving towards the goal is key.

I'll proceed by creating a new policy where I change several states' actions, particularly in the upper rows and near the goal, to push towards state 15 more effectively while avoiding known hole positions.
