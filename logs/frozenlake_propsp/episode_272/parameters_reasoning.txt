You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Alright, I'm trying to find the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment using an episodic reward where each state gives a reward of 0 except the goal (state 15) which gives +1. The agent can take actions with certain probabilities and needs to avoid stepping into holes, leading to failure.

First, I understand that the policy is represented by a set of parameters where each parameter corresponds to an action for a specific state. Since there are 16 states (4x4 grid), params[0] is for state 0, params[1] for state 1, and so on up to params[15] for state 15.

The policy is the vector of these parameters, each being 0, 1, 2, or 3. The goal is to reach state 15 with maximum reward. Since the problem states that the global optimal should be around None (or very high), I need a strategy that explores all possibilities without falling into holes.

In the training example given, params seem to have various combinations of actions. However, without prior examples, it's challenging to determine which combination would lead to the best rewards.

I realize that since the environment is slippery, each action choice doesn't yield 1/3 probability as in a standard policy gradient approach but instead 3 possible directions with equal chance when an action is taken. This means that sometimes, certain paths might be more likely than others based on the parameters provided.

To find the optimal params, I would need to explore different combinations and see which one yields the highest reward. However, without prior knowledge or examples of successful policies, it's difficult to predict.

I recall that in policy gradient methods, using techniques like RMSprop or Adam optimizes the parameters by adjusting them based on the gradient of the expected reward with respect to each parameter. This would help find a balance between exploiting good paths and exploring others to avoid holes.

Given the complexity and the need for exploration, I think a promising approach is to use an iterative method that tries different params, evaluates their rewards, and adjusts them accordingly. Starting from a default (like 0, 1, etc.) and gradually refining based on observed outcomes would be effective.

I also consider that since the agent needs to explore holes through previous trajectories, I should ensure that the exploration doesn't get stuck once it detects an illegal move but instead focuses on re-traversing states visited before when a hole is found. This might involve revisiting states with different paths to avoid repeating problematic ones too soon.

In conclusion, without specific observations of past training runs or examples, adjusting params directly isn't feasible. Instead, implementing an iterative policy optimization method using gradient-based techniques seems like the way forward to find the optimal balance between exploration and exploitation.
