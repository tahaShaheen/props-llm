You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy parameters for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get the agent to reach state 15 (the bottom right corner) as quickly and safely as possible, avoiding any holes along the way.

From the problem description, each action taken by the agent has a probability of moving in three directions with equal chance due to the slippery nature of the environment. This means that even if the agent chooses an action, it might not end up where we expect because there's some randomness involved.

Looking at the top 8 best performing params, I see that many of them have f(params) around 0.15. That's significantly below the target of 1.0, which suggests that we're still in the exploration phase since the rewards aren't close to optimal yet. So, according to the strategy, I should focus on maximizing information gain by trying out new configurations rather than tweaking existing ones.

The most recent params provided have even lower rewards (like 0.00 and 0.05), which reinforces that we're not yet exploiting but still exploring. Therefore, my next move should be to propose a completely new set of parameters that haven't been tried before, ensuring they don't fall into any holes based on the trajectories observed.

I notice in the previous attempts, some policies lead the agent towards state 15 but get stuck or fall into holes because their action choices aren't optimal for all states. For example, if a policy keeps moving right from certain states, it might end up stepping into a hole instead of reaching the goal.

So, I need to design a policy where each state's action choice has a high probability of leading towards the goal without risking falling into any holes. Since each action can result in three possible moves, I should choose actions that have at least one safe path towards the goal. For instance, from state 0 (top-left), choosing action 1 might move down or right, but considering the slippery nature, it's better to pick an action that has a higher chance of moving towards the goal without hitting a hole.

I'll go through each state and decide which action is least likely to lead into a hole. For example:

- State 0: Choosing action 1 (which can move right or down) might be safer than others.
- State 1: Maybe action 3 could help move towards the goal without hitting a hole.
- I'll continue this reasoning for each state, ensuring that each choice has at least one valid path towards the goal.

After considering all states and their possible transitions, I'll compile the params array with these new values, making sure they haven't been tried before. This approach should help gather more information about which paths are safe and effective.
