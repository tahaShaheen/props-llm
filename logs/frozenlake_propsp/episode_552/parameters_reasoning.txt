You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get the agent from any starting position to state 15 (the bottom-right corner) without falling into any holes. The tricky part is that the environment is slippery, meaning each action leads to one of three possible directions with equal probability.

First, I need to understand how the policy works. Each state (from 0 to 15) has an associated action from [0,1,2,3], which determines which direction the agent will try to move. But because of the slipperiness, each action leads to a random movement with three possible outcomes.

Looking at the problem statement, I see that the optimal reward should be around 1.0, meaning the agent successfully reaches state 15 in most cases. The current best policies have rewards around 0.30, which is significantly lower than desired, so we need to explore more.

The recent parameters tried include various combinations but none have achieved a high reward yet. For example, one recent parameter set led to trajectories that didn't reach the goal and had many loops. This suggests that the current policies might not be guiding the agent efficiently towards state 15 or are causing it to get stuck in holes.

To improve this, I should focus on creating a policy that directs the agent towards the goal (state 15) as much as possible while avoiding the holes. Since each action is probabilistic, the policy needs to choose actions that have the highest chance of moving the agent closer to state 15 without leading it into dangerous areas.

I recall that in such grid-based environments, a common strategy is for the agent to move towards the goal based on its position. For example, if the agent is in the top row (states 0-3), it should aim to go right or down. If it's in the first column (states 0,4,8,12), it should probably move right since moving up might lead it into a hole or out of bounds.

Looking at the current parameters, some states are set to actions that might not be optimal. For instance, state 0 is set to action 1 in some recent trials, which could mean trying to go right, down, or left with equal chance. But since the agent starts at state 0 (top-left), moving down would take it to state 4, which is still on the path towards the goal.

Wait, no—state 0 is the top-left corner. Moving down from state 0 would take it to state 4, which is correct. But considering that actions are slippery, we need to choose actions that maximize the chance of moving in the desired direction.

So perhaps for state 0, choosing action 1 (which allows movements right, down, or left) might not be the best. Maybe action 2 would give more opportunities to move up or right, but wait, from state 0, moving up is impossible because it's already at the top row. So action 0 for state 0 could be better, as it gives a chance to go down (to state 4) or left (which might not make sense, so perhaps better to avoid that.

Hmm, maybe I should look into each state individually and decide which action would best guide the agent towards state 15 while avoiding holes.

For example:

- State 0: Top-left corner. The goal is to move down or right. But from state 0, moving right is possible by choosing action 1 (which includes right as one of its options). Alternatively, action 2 also allows right movement. So perhaps setting state 0's action to either 1 or 2 would be good.

- State 1: Top-middle. From here, the agent should aim to move down towards row 2 or right towards column 3 (state 3), which is closer to the goal.

Continuing this way for each state might help in creating a more optimal policy.

But since the environment is slippery and there are holes, I need to ensure that the chosen actions don't lead the agent into any holes. For example, certain states near the edges or in specific positions have holes, so the policy must avoid actions that could lead to those holes.

Given that the recent parameters didn't perform well, perhaps we should try a different approach. Maybe using a more greedy strategy where each state's action is chosen to maximize the immediate chance of moving towards the goal.

Another thought: since the average reward is around 0.20-0.30, which is low, it suggests that the agent is not reaching the goal often and is getting stuck or falling into holes frequently. Therefore, the next policy should focus on paths that minimize this risk.

Perhaps setting up the policy to always move towards the right or down when possible could help navigate towards state 15 without going near the holes.

Looking at the example trajectories provided, some ended quickly because the agent fell into a hole after a few steps. So, the new policy needs to avoid actions that lead to those holes from neighboring states.

In summary, I need to create a parameter set where each state's action is chosen to move the agent as close as possible to state 15 without stepping on any holes, considering the slippery nature of movement.
