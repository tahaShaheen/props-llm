You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to find the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment described. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward by reaching state 15 without falling into any holes.

First, I need to understand the setup:

- **Environment**: 4x4 grid with states 0 to 15.
- **Actions**: Each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability due to slipperiness.
- **Rewards**: +1 for reaching state 15, 0 elsewhere. Holes end the episode.

Given that the policy is an array of 16 actions (each from 0-3), I need to determine which actions will guide the agent optimally through the grid.

Looking at the provided data:

The top-performing policies have average rewards around 0.2, which is much lower than the target of 1.0. This suggests that none of the current policies are consistently reaching the goal. The trajectories show various paths, but none successfully reach state 15 without falling into a hole or getting stuck in loops.

Since the maximum reward observed is 0.2, which is significantly below the target, I should adopt an exploration strategy to gather more information rather than exploiting suboptimal policies. My aim is to propose new parameter configurations that can lead to higher rewards by exploring different paths and avoiding holes.

I need to consider each state's possible actions and how they could guide the agent towards the goal while minimizing the risk of falling into holes. For example, states near the edges or in certain positions might have specific optimal actions based on their neighbors.

Let me think about each state:

- **State 0 (top-left)**: Possible moves are down, left, up. Left is out of bounds, so moving right (which would be action leading to state 1) or down (state 4). But since the agent can only choose one action per policy, I need to pick an action that could lead towards the goal when considering the slippery nature.

- **State 15 (goal)**: Once reached, the episode ends with a reward. So policies leading here are optimal.

But given the slipperiness, even if the agent chooses the correct direction, it might not reach the intended state. Therefore, the policy must account for all possible moves from each action choice.

I need to analyze the trajectories provided to see where agents are failing and adjust the policies accordingly. For instance:

- In one trajectory, the agent takes a long time without reaching the goal.
- Another falls into a hole early on.

So, perhaps adjusting certain states' actions could help avoid holes or push towards the goal more effectively.

I'll start by trying to modify some of the less optimal parameters from previous iterations. For example, changing state 0's action from 1 to another might provide a better path. Similarly, examining other states where agents are getting stuck and altering their actions to encourage movement towards the goal or away from holes.

Finally, I'll propose a new set of params that is distinct from previously tried configurations, focusing on states near the goal and potential paths, ensuring each action has a chance to navigate towards state 15 without falling into known holes.
