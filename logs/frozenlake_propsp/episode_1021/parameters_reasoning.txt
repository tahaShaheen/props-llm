You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help optimize a policy for the FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right) and get a reward of +1, avoiding holes along the way. The agent moves in a 4x4 grid, and each action has three possible outcomes due to the slippery nature of the environment.

Looking at the problem, I need to propose a policy that's as optimal as possible. From the given examples, it seems like the best performing policies are averaging around 0.45 reward, which is quite low compared to the target of 1.0. So, there's room for improvement.

I remember that in FrozenLake, the holes are at certain states. I think they're at positions 5,7,11, and 13 or something like that. But since the exact locations might vary, it's better to ensure that each state's action doesn't lead into a hole with any probability.

Given that, for each state, the policy should choose an action that maximizes the chance of moving towards the goal while avoiding holes. Since the environment is slippery, the agent can end up in any of three directions when taking an action. So, we need to pick actions that, on average, guide the agent towards 15 without stepping into a hole.

Looking at some of the top-performing params, they seem to have certain patterns. For example, in state 0 (top-left), choosing action 2 (which allows moving up, right, or down) might help explore different paths. Similarly, for other states, actions are chosen that try to move towards the goal.

I think a good strategy is to set each state's action such that it tries to head directly towards the goal, considering the possible slipperiness. For example, if the agent is on the top row (states 0-3), moving right or down would be better. But since actions have three outcomes, we need to pick the one that has the highest probability of moving in a good direction.

Wait, but each action leads to three directions. So for state i, the policy should choose an action whose possible moves include steps towards the goal and avoid holes. For example, if from state 0, choosing action 2 (which can move up, right, or down) might be better because moving right is one step closer to the goal.

But I also need to make sure that for each state, none of the possible moves from the chosen action lead into a hole. That's tricky because without knowing where exactly the holes are, it's hard to ensure complete safety. But based on common FrozenLake setups, I can assume certain positions as holes and adjust accordingly.

In the top-performing params given, many have action 3 for state 1 (which is top-middle). Action 3 allows moving left, up, or right. So from state 1, moving right would take it closer to the goal, but if there's a hole in that direction, it might be risky.

Perhaps I should focus on creating a policy where each action from a state has a path that leads towards 15 without ever stepping into known holes. For example, states near the top-right (like state 3) would benefit from moving down or right, but if moving right is a hole, then maybe moving down is better.

Wait, in the given trajectories, some end quickly because they fall into holes. So perhaps I need to adjust actions for certain states to avoid those paths.

For instance, looking at the most recent params: one had action 1 for state 0 (move right, down, or left). If moving right from 0 is a hole, that might be bad. So maybe changing it to an action that doesn't risk going into the hole would be better.

Alternatively, if I can find which states are holes, I can adjust the policy accordingly. Let's say state 5 is a hole (second row, second column). Then from state 4, moving right might lead to state 5, which is a hole. So in that case, action for state 4 should avoid right.

But without knowing the exact positions of the holes, it's challenging. However, based on common FrozenLake setups, I can make educated guesses.

I think a standard optimal policy for FrozenLake (without slipping) would be to move towards the goal directly. But with slipping, this becomes more complex. The policy needs to account for uncertainty in movement.

So perhaps setting each state's action to move as close to the goal as possible, considering all three possible directions, and ensuring that none of them lead into a hole if possible.

Given that, I might start by creating a rough map of what actions each state should take. For example:

- State 0 (top-left): moving right or down.
- States in the top row: move right until at state 3, then move down.
- Middle states: move towards the bottom-right.

But considering slipperiness, I need to pick actions that have a good chance of getting closer to the goal. For example:

- From state 0 (top-left), action 2 allows moving up, right, or down. Moving right is better, so choosing action 2 gives a chance to go right.
- From state 1 (top-middle), action 3 allows moving left, up, or right. Maybe action 3 is good because it can move right towards the goal.
- Similarly, for other states, choose actions that have a higher probability of moving towards the goal.

Looking at the top-performing params again, they seem to have certain patterns: for example, many use action 1 or 3 in state 0 and 1. Maybe those are good starting points.

Since we're at iteration 1021, which is less than half of MAX_ITERATIONS (5000), perhaps I should continue exploring different policies rather than exploiting the best ones yet found. The current top reward is around 0.45, which is significantly below 1.0, so it's better to explore more.

I need to propose a new set of params that haven't been tried before and could potentially lead to higher rewards by avoiding holes and guiding towards the goal effectively.

Let me try to construct such a policy:

- For each state, select an action that has movement options which include steps towards the goal.
- Avoid actions that have any possibility of moving into known hole states.

Assuming that the holes are in certain positions (like 5,7,11,13), I can adjust the actions accordingly. For example, from state 4, if moving right leads to a hole at 5, then action should be set to move down or left instead.

But without exact hole positions, it's hard to make precise adjustments. So perhaps a general approach is better.

I'll propose a policy where each state chooses an action that has the highest chance of moving towards the goal, considering all possible movement directions.

For example:

- State 0: Action 2 (up, right, down). Right moves closer to goal.
- State 1: Action 3 (left, up, right). Right moves towards goal.
- State 2: Action 1 (right, down, left). Right is good, but if in a row where moving right is risky, maybe adjust.
- Continue this pattern for all states.

But I need to ensure that the action choices don't lead into holes. So, perhaps some trial and error is needed.

Given that, I'll try to create a params array where each state's action is set to move towards the goal as much as possible, with some consideration for avoiding loops or staying within safe paths.

Let me draft such a policy:

params[0]: 2 (from 0, can go up, right, down)
params[1]: 3 (from 1, can go left, up, right)
params[2]: 1 (from 2, can go right, down, left)
...
Wait, but this is just a rough idea. I might need to adjust based on the actual hole positions.

Alternatively, perhaps setting all states to action that moves them towards the bottom-right as much as possible, considering their current position.

But without knowing where the holes are, it's challenging to make precise adjustments. So, maybe the best approach is to propose a policy that tries to move right or down in each state, depending on their position.

Another thought: since slipping can send the agent in any of three directions, choosing actions that have movement options that include steps towards the goal while avoiding holes as much as possible.

Given all this, I'll propose a new set of params where each state's action is chosen to move towards the goal without leading into known hole positions.
