You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get an average reward close to 1.0 over 20 episodes. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, understanding the environment: it's a 4x4 grid with state 15 as the target, which gives +1 reward. Holes are present, and stepping on them ends the episode with 0 reward. The slippery nature means each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability.

Looking at the params structure, each of the 16 states has an action (0-3) assigned. The challenge is to set these actions such that the agent reaches state 15 without falling into holes, considering the probabilistic movement.

From the provided data, the top-performing params have average rewards around 0.45, which is less than the target of 1.0. This suggests we need a more effective strategy.

I notice that in some trajectories, the agent gets stuck or falls into loops, like moving between states without progressing towards the goal. Maybe adjusting certain states' actions can help break these loops and guide the agent more directly to the goal.

For example, state 15 should obviously stay as is since it's the target. But looking at other states near the edges or in tricky positions, perhaps changing their action could increase the chances of moving towards the right direction despite the slipperiness.

Also, considering that each action leads to three possible moves, choosing actions that have a higher probability of moving towards the goal might be better. For instance, from state 14 (which is one step left of the goal), taking an action that mostly leads right would be beneficial.

I should also look at states near holes and ensure that their policies avoid those holes as much as possible. Maybe changing actions in such states to move away or towards safer areas.

Another thought: since the agent has no memory, each trial is independent, so each params configuration needs to be self-contained without relying on past knowledge beyond what's given.

Perhaps focusing on states along the main path from start (0) to goal (15), ensuring that each step increases the likelihood of moving towards the goal. For example, in state 4 (which is at row 2, column 1), choosing an action that tends to move down or right could help progress.

Wait, looking back, some top params have certain patterns. Maybe tweaking a few key states can make a significant difference. For instance, if from state 10 (row 3, column 2) the current policy is moving left or up, perhaps changing it to move right would increase chances of reaching state 15.

Also, considering that each action has three possible outcomes, we need to balance exploration and exploitation. Since the average reward isn't close to 1.0 yet, maybe exploring new configurations rather than optimizing existing ones could help gather more data on which states are problematic or beneficial.

I should generate a params array where as many states as possible have actions that push towards the goal, considering the slippery nature. Maybe setting most states' actions to move right or down, depending on their position, to increase the chance of moving towards state 15.

Let me draft some changes:

- States closer to the top-left might benefit from moving right or down.
- Middle states should have a mix of actions that can navigate around holes and towards the goal.
- Edge states need careful handling to avoid falling into holes but still progress.

I'll try adjusting certain states' actions. For example, in state 14 (row 3, column 3), maybe action 0 or 2 would help. Similarly, for other edge cases.

After considering all this, I think changing some of the middle and lower states' actions to prioritize right and down movements could lead to a higher reward.
