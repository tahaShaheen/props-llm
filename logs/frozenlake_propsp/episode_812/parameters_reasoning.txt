You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. It's a 4x4 grid where the agent moves around, and there are holes that can end the episode if stepped on. The goal is to reach state 15, which gives a reward of +1, while all other states give 0. The environment is slippery, meaning each action taken has a 33% chance of moving in one of three directions.

First, I need to understand how the policy works. The policy is an array of 16 elements (params[0] to params[15]), where each element represents the action to take when in that state. Actions can be 0, 1, 2, or 3, each corresponding to a different set of possible movements due to the slippery nature.

Looking at the provided data, the top-performing policies have average rewards around 0.45, which is below the target of 1.0. This suggests that while these policies are working better than others, they're not yet optimal. The trajectories show that some paths end quickly by falling into holes or reaching the goal but not consistently.

The most recent attempts have lower rewards (like 0.10 and 0.05), indicating that maybe the agent is still getting stuck in holes or not efficiently moving towards the goal. I need to find a policy that avoids these holes while effectively navigating towards state 15.

I should consider how each action from a given state can lead closer to the goal without stepping into holes. Since each action has a 33% chance of three directions, the policy needs to choose actions that maximize the probability of reaching the goal and minimize the risk of falling into holes.

Looking at the grid, state 15 is in the bottom-right corner. So, from states near it, moving right or down should help reach the goal. However, I need to check which paths are safe and avoid any known holes.

Given that previous policies have trajectories where they sometimes fall into holes, perhaps adjusting certain actions in key states can prevent this. For example, if a state is adjacent to a hole, choosing an action that moves away from it or towards the goal would be better.

I might start by setting up some heuristics: for each state, choose the action that has the highest chance of moving closer to 15 while avoiding known dangerous areas. But since I don't have specific information on where the holes are, I need a more general approach.

Perhaps focusing on states near the goal and ensuring their actions lead towards it without risk. For example, from state 14 (which is one step away from 15), taking action that moves right or down should help reach the goal.

Also, in earlier attempts, some policies get stuck moving in circles or end up falling into holes because of the slippery nature causing unintended movements. So, the policy needs to be robust against such possibilities by choosing actions that have a higher chance of leading towards the goal even when there's uncertainty.

I should also consider if certain states are particularly dangerous and adjust their actions accordingly. For instance, if moving left from state 1 leads to a hole, then perhaps params[1] should avoid action 0 or something that could cause that movement.

Another angle is to look at the trajectories provided. The best-performing policies had trajectories like (0,1) leading towards 4 and then further down. Maybe this path avoids holes but isn't efficient enough. Adjusting some actions in early states might allow for a more direct path towards the goal.

I think I need to propose a new set of parameters that deviates from previous attempts, especially since we're still below the target reward. Perhaps tweaking certain high-impact states can lead to better overall performance.
