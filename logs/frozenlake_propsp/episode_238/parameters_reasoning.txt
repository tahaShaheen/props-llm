You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I need to help find the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The state is a 4x4 grid with states numbered from 0 to 15. Each action can take the agent in four directions, but when the agent is on certain states, some actions are unavailable or have different probabilities.

First, the problem states that the policy is represented by an array of 16 values, where each value corresponds to a state (0-15). These values represent the action to take for each state. The goal is to find a set of these parameters that maximizes the episodic reward f(params).

The user provided several examples of params and their corresponding rewards. For instance, one example has an average reward of 1.00. Another had 0.30 and another 0.25. The most recent ones include 0.05 and 0.00, while some have the same as others.

Since I don't know where exactly the global optimal lies, I'll need to explore different parameter values systematically. Considering that each action can take on values 0-3, but when certain states are taken, the probabilities might change based on whether it's the top row or column.

I should try different combinations of parameters and observe how they affect the reward. It seems like higher rewards suggest better exploration in tricky areas (like holes), so I should avoid stepping into those. But since all other actions yield 0 rewards except for action 3, which is left, maybe some states will require avoiding certain directions.

Also, the agent starts at state 0, top-left corner. From there, moving up, down, or left could be tricky, especially if the hole is in state 12 (bottom-right). I need to avoid stepping into holes unless necessary.

Given that all params are from [0,3], I can try each combination but it might take a lot of iterations. Since the user will stop after 400 steps with their last response at iteration 238, I should continue until convergence or find a consistent value.

I think a good approach is to randomly sample parameter combinations and compute the reward for each until we see stable values across multiple runs.
