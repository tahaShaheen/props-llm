You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. So, first off, the environment is a 4x4 grid where the goal is state 15, and there are some holes that will end the episode if stepped on. The agent's actions are slippery, meaning each action has a 33% chance of moving in one of three directions.

The policy is an array of 16 values, each representing the action to take in states 0 through 15. My goal is to find the optimal set of parameters that maximizes the episodic reward, which should ideally be around 1.0 if it's possible to reach the goal consistently without falling into holes.

Looking at the provided data, I see that most policies have low rewards (around 0.1 to 0.2). The best performing ones so far only average 0.20, which is way below the target of 1.0. This suggests that the current policies aren't effectively navigating towards state 15 without falling into holes or getting stuck in loops.

I need to consider how each state's action choice affects the agent's path. For example, being near the edges (like states 3,7,11,14) might require different strategies than being in the center. Also, avoiding holes is crucial—so I need policies that prevent moving into those states.

In the most recent attempts, the policies are either looping indefinitely or falling into holes quickly. This indicates that perhaps the current actions aren't guiding the agent towards state 15 effectively. Maybe some states aren't being explored enough, or the policy isn't encouraging movement directly towards the goal.

Given that I'm supposed to act as a stateless optimizer, I should focus on maximizing information gain. Since previous policies haven't achieved high rewards, I need to explore new configurations. But also, if I notice some parameters are consistently good, maybe tweaking them could lead to better performance.

Looking at the top-performing params, they have certain patterns, like using action 2 and 3 frequently. However, their reward is still low. Maybe changing a few key states' actions could make a difference. For example, ensuring that from state 0 (top-left), the agent moves right or down to start heading towards state 15.

I also need to think about how each action's probabilities affect the overall trajectory. Since the environment is slippery, choosing an action that has a higher chance of moving towards the goal might be better. For instance, in some states, taking an action that could lead to multiple directions towards the goal might balance exploration and exploitation.

Perhaps I should adjust the actions for certain key states, like near the edges or near the holes, to prevent falling into them. Also, ensuring a path from the start (state 0) directly to state 15 by moving right and down when possible could help.

In summary, I need to create a policy that carefully navigates each state, avoiding holes and guiding towards the goal with actions that have higher probabilities of success given the slippery nature. Testing new configurations that deviate from previous attempts might reveal better reward outcomes.
