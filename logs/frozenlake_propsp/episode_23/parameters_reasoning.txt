You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to find the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment using a grid-based approach with multiple policies. The problem statement mentions that the global optimal reward is around None, which suggests that we're aiming for high rewards but need careful exploration.

First, I understand the environment setup: it's a 4x4 grid where each cell represents a state (0 to 15). The agent can move up, down, left, or right. When moving in certain directions from specific states, there's a slip probability involved, meaning the next action is chosen randomly among three options with equal chance.

The policy is represented by an array of 16 parameters, where each parameter corresponds to a state (0-15). Each parameter is an integer between 0 and 3. The goal is to choose these parameters to maximize the episodic reward over time.

Looking at the provided examples, some policies yield rewards around 1.00, while others have lower rewards like 0.20 or even negative values. My task is to find a parameter set that yields an optimal reward close to None, meaning it should converge towards high or stable rewards through exploration and exploitation.

The user has given several parameter sets as examples, each with different combinations of 0-3 for the parameters [0] to [2]. These seem to vary in how the policy responds to each state. For instance, some policies might suggest moving right (param[1]) more often, others left (param[0]), and so on.

To approach this systematically, I'll consider varying param[0], param[1], and param[2] as these seem to control the movement from the top row (states 0-3). Changing these could lead to different exploration patterns. The remaining parameters [3] might influence other states, but their effects are less direct.

I should explore a range of possible values for these parameters while ensuring each value is within [0,1,2,3]. For example, trying all combinations where param[0], param[1], and param[2] can be 0, 1, 2, or 3. This gives us 4^3 = 64 possible parameter sets to test.

However, the user's initial instructions suggest that after each iteration, I should output a specific line with params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, etc., without any other explanation. So instead of testing all 64 combinations right away, I might need to focus on key parameters first. 

But considering the complexity, perhaps it's better to start by adjusting param[2] since it has a larger impact due to being chosen from [up, right, down]. Changing this could significantly alter the movement probabilities. Similarly, varying param[1], which is influenced by left and other directions, might affect more states.

Alternatively, I can try setting some parameters to 0 or 3 to see if that leads to better rewards. For example, if a parameter is set to 0, it means taking that action with zero probability but selecting from the other three options equally. This could encourage more exploration in certain directions.

After trying these variations, perhaps I can observe which combination stabilizes the reward at a higher value without causing instability or negative feedback loops in the policy.
