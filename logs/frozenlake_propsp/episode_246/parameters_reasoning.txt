You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Okay, so I need to find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment where the agent is in a slippery state. The tricky part is that some states are holes that can be stepped on and lead back into the game. This means the agent has to explore thoroughly through these holes by reading their trajectories.

The policy parameters are an array of 16 values, each representing the action (0-3) when the agent is in a specific state. My goal is to set these parameters so that the agent can navigate from the start state (0) to the goal (15) efficiently, avoiding the holes and maximizing rewards along the way.

I know that the reward for reaching state 15 is +1, and other states give 0 unless there's a hole. The policy should explore all possible paths through the holes. However, since the environment is slippery, each action taken has an equal probability of moving in any direction, making exploration necessary to avoid getting stuck.

I remember that parameters like params[2] (up) or params[3] (left) might be problematic because they can lead to unexpected states due to their high probability. So, I need to balance these out by exploring other actions when necessary.

Looking at the examples provided, some policies use 0, 1, 2, or 3 for different state positions. For instance, in one example, all top-left states (params[0] and [1]) are set to 2, which probably means moving up from there, avoiding the slippery action probabilities.

Since the policy values should be chosen from [0,1,2,3], I need to ensure that each parameter isn't redundant. For example, if params[i] is 2, it could mean a combination of actions 1 and 3, but since all result in equal probability, perhaps setting params[2] to the same as another action would help.

I also consider that the agent should avoid cycles by occasionally exploring other paths when stuck. Maybe starting with parameters set to 0 or 1 where possible could help find a clear path quickly without unnecessary exploration elsewhere.

Maybe I can start by randomly assigning some parameters, like setting params[2] and params[3] to low values (like 1) so that the up and left actions are more likely. But then, if the agent gets stuck in a hole, it might not explore other paths efficiently.

Wait, perhaps focusing on exploration through higher parameters where action selection varies could help avoid getting stuck. For example, setting params[0] to 2 (up), which spreads out the directions but also explores left and right.

Alternatively, I could try using parameters that represent taking certain actions more often based on their position in the state grid. Maybe params[1] being higher for some states where moving down from there is safer due to holes.

I might need to experiment with setting params like [2] = 3 or [3] = 0, as they have higher probabilities of leading in certain directions that could avoid getting stuck.

After trying several combinations and seeing the agent's performance, I realize that without enough exploration, the agent will get stuck. So I must ensure that parameters allow for sufficient movement while keeping some actions more likely than others to explore different paths when needed.
