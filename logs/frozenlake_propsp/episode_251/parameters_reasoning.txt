You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me start by understanding the problem thoroughly.

The environment is a 4x4 grid where the agent can move in four directions: left, down, right, up. Each state is represented by a number from 0 to 15, with each row containing 4 states. The goal is to reach state 15, which gives a reward of +1, while all other states give 0. There are holes in the grid that end the episode if stepped on.

The agent's actions aren't straightforward because the environment is slippery. When an action is taken, there's a 33% chance it will move in one of three directions. For each action (0 to 3), there are specific possible moves:

- Action 0: down, left, up
- Action 1: right, down, left
- Action 2: up, right, down
- Action 3: left, up, right

I need to design a policy represented by an array of 16 numbers (params[0] to params[15]), each indicating the action taken in that state.

From the history provided, I can see that previous policies have average rewards around 0.15 or lower, which is significantly below the target of 1.0. This suggests that the current policies aren't effectively reaching the goal and are getting stuck or falling into holes often.

The recent attempts include various configurations, but they all result in low rewards. For example, some trajectories loop endlessly without progressing towards state 15. Others get trapped near the top-left corner (state 0), which is a hole or leads to holes. 

Given that the average reward is far below the target, my strategy should focus on exploration rather than exploitation. I need to propose new policies that haven't been tried before to gather more information about which actions lead to success.

One approach could be to design a policy where each state's action directs towards moving closer to the goal (state 15). Since the grid is slippery, the agent needs multiple attempts, so the policy should encourage movement towards the right and down directions as much as possible. However, considering the slipperiness, choosing actions that have a higher probability of moving in the desired direction could help.

For example:
- States near the goal (like 12, 13, 14) should push the agent to move right or down.
- Middle states should prioritize moving towards the lower-right quadrant.

Looking at previous policies, some had params[0] set to 1 or 2. Let me try setting params[0] to 2 (up), but considering state 0 is top-left, up isn't possible, so it might loop. Alternatively, setting it to 3 could move right with a third chance.

Another idea is to have states in the top row (0-3) encourage moving down, as that's the only way to progress towards the goal. So for these states, choosing actions that include down as one of their possible moves would be beneficial.

Let me map out some key states:

- State 0: top-left corner. To move right or down.
- State 3: top row end. Should push towards state 7 (right) or state 4 (down).
- States in the first column (0,4,8,12): perhaps encourage moving right to avoid falling into holes.

I'll try creating a policy where each state's action is designed to move towards the goal as much as possible, considering the slipperiness. For example:

- In state 0: choose action 3 (right, up, left). But since it's top-left, moving down might be better, so perhaps action 1 or 2.

Wait, in state 0, possible moves are limited because moving up would stay in place (since it's the first row), same with left. So actions that include down and right would help move towards the goal.

Let me try assigning params[0] = 3: which for action 3 gives a 1/3 chance to go right, up, or right again? Wait no, action 3 is left, up, right.

Wait, correction:

Action 3 in any state will have a 33% chance to move left, up, or right. So from state 0 (top-left), moving left would stay at 0 (if it's the first column), up would stay at 0 (first row), so only right is useful here.

Therefore, for state 0, choosing action 3 gives a 1/3 chance to move right towards state 1. That seems better than other actions because moving down from state 0 isn't possible as it's the first column? Wait no: in state 0 (row 0, col 0), moving down would go to state 4.

Wait, actually, in FrozenLake, each move is allowed unless it's out of bounds. So in state 0, moving down would take you to state 4, which is the cell below. Similarly, moving right takes you to state 1.

So perhaps for state 0, choosing an action that includes both down and right as possible moves would be beneficial. Let me see:

Action 0: down, left, up
From state 0, moving down leads to state 4, which is better than left or up (both lead back). So action 0 gives a chance to move down.

Action 1: right, down, left
Right takes to 1, down to 4, left stays in 0. This might be good because right and down are both towards the goal.

Action 3: left, up, right
Left and up stay in 0; right moves to 1.

So for state 0, choosing action 1 (right, down, left) gives a chance to move right or down, which is better than other actions. Alternatively, action 3 has a chance to go right but also includes staying in place.

But since the environment is slippery and there are holes, maybe it's safer to have a policy that tries multiple paths to increase the chances of avoiding holes.

Given that previous attempts didn't yield high rewards, perhaps we need to explore more diverse policies. Maybe setting each state to choose an action that has a higher probability of moving towards the goal or exploring different paths.

Another approach is to make sure that from any non-terminal state, the agent has multiple possible ways to reach the goal without falling into holes. This might involve creating loops or detours if necessary.

Wait, but the environment's slippery nature makes it so that each action leads to a 3-way choice. So perhaps the optimal policy needs to account for all possible paths and choose actions that maximize the probability of reaching state 15 without hitting any holes.

But since I can't remember previous attempts (as per the stateless strategy), I need to propose a new set of params each time based on what's been seen so far. Looking at the recent policies, they seem to cluster around certain action choices but haven't yet found one that reliably reaches the goal.

Given that, perhaps I should choose a policy where each state directs towards moving right and down as much as possible. For example:

- States in the first row (0-3) could be set to move right or down.
- States in the last column (3,7,11,15) would aim to stay there if they're close to the goal.

But considering the slipperiness, maybe setting each state's action to have a higher chance of moving towards the goal direction. For instance:

- In states where moving right is possible, set actions that include right.
- In states where moving down is necessary, set actions that include down.

For example:

params[0] = 1 (right, down, left) → allows moving right or down from state 0.
params[1] = 3 (left, up, right) → from state 1, can move right to state 2 or down to state 5.
... and so on.

But I need to map this for all 16 states. Alternatively, perhaps setting a policy that encourages moving towards the goal by always choosing actions that have a higher chance of progressing towards it.

Another idea is to use a greedy approach where each action leads closer to the goal as much as possible. For example:

- From state i, choose an action that maximizes the probability of moving towards the right or down.

But considering the grid structure and the slipperiness, this might be complex.

Alternatively, I could set all states to move in a way that tends towards the lower-right corner. For instance:

- For states not in the last row or column, choose actions that have a higher chance of moving right or down.
- For states near the goal, perhaps set actions that keep them there or push further.

Wait, but state 15 is terminal, so once reached, it's done. So for states adjacent to 15 (like 14 and 11), their actions should aim to move towards 15.

Given all this, I think a possible strategy is:

- For each state, choose an action that includes moving right or down as one of the options.
- Avoid actions that have a high chance of moving into known holes.

But without knowing where the holes are exactly, it's challenging. However, from the trajectories provided, some paths end quickly because they fall into holes. For example:

Trajectory: (0,1) (4,2) (8,2) suggests that state 8 is a hole or leads to one.

Wait, in one of the top params, the trajectory was (0,1) (4,2) (8,2). Then it stopped because perhaps state 8 is a hole. Similarly, another trajectory went through (0,3) and ended up looping.

So maybe states 4-7 are holes or lead to holes? Or specific states in those rows?

Alternatively, perhaps the holes are randomly placed, so I need a general policy that avoids getting stuck.

Given all this, I think proposing a new set of params where each state's action is chosen to maximize the chance of moving towards the goal while diversifying actions to explore different paths could be beneficial.

Perhaps setting params as follows:

- For states in the first column (0,4,8,12), choose actions that include moving right or down.
- For other states, choose actions that have a mix of right and down movements.

But I need to translate this into specific action choices for each state.

Alternatively, perhaps setting all states to always try moving towards the goal by choosing actions that include right and down.

Wait, let me consider an example:

State 0: top-left. Possible actions:
- Action 1 (right, down, left) gives a chance to move right or down.
- Action 3 (left, up, right) also has a chance to go right.

I'll choose action 1 for state 0, as it allows moving right or down with higher probability.

State 1: top-middle. Possible actions:
- Action 1: right, down, left → can move towards state 2 or down to 5.
- Action 3: left, up, right → can go back or move right.

I'll choose action 3 for state 1, as it includes moving right.

Continuing this way for all states:

But I need a systematic approach. Maybe create a grid and assign actions based on proximity to the goal.

Alternatively, perhaps setting all even-numbered states (0,2,4,...) to one action and odd-numbered states to another could spread out the exploration.

Wait, but without knowing the hole locations, it's hard to ensure safety. So maybe focusing on a policy that moves towards the lower-right corner while avoiding loops.

Given that previous attempts didn't yield high rewards, I should try a new configuration where each state has an action that allows moving right or down with higher probability, ensuring that the agent has multiple paths to reach the goal.

Let me attempt to create such a params array:

params[0] = 1 (action 1: right, down, left)
params[1] = 3 (action 3: left, up, right)
params[2] = 1
params[3] = 3
params[4] = 1
params[5] = 3
params[6] = 1
params[7] = 3
params[8] = 1
params[9] = 3
params[10] = 1
params[11] = 3
params[12] = 1
params[13] = 3
params[14] = 1
params[15] = 2 (action 2: up, right, down) → but since it's the goal, maybe action 0?

Wait, state 15 is terminal, so perhaps setting its action to anything doesn't matter. But in practice, once reached, the episode ends.

So for state 15, any action is fine, as the agent stops anyway.

Alternatively, set params[15] = 2 (action 2: up, right, down) which would have no effect since the episode is done.

But I'm not sure if this configuration will lead to higher rewards. It alternates actions between states, trying different directions.

Another idea is to make sure that each state has a mix of movements that don't trap the agent in loops. For example:

- States in the first row (0-3) could alternate between right and down.
- Middle rows could also do similar, ensuring movement towards the goal.

But without knowing hole locations, it's tricky. So perhaps choosing actions that have a higher chance of moving right or down while avoiding staying in place.

Given all this, I'll propose a params array where each state alternates between action 1 and 3, to encourage exploring different paths towards the goal.
