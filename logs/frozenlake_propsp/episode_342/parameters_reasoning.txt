You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help optimize a policy for the FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with the highest possible reward, avoiding holes along the way. Let me break down what I know.

First, the environment is a 4x4 grid where each cell represents a state from 0 to 15. The slippery nature means that when an action is taken, there's a 33% chance of moving in one of three directions. So, for example, if I'm at state 0 (top-left corner) and take action 0, I could go down to 4, left (which isn't possible since it's the edge), or up (also impossible). Wait, no—actually, the description says that each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability. So for each action, there are three possible directions, but if moving in a particular direction is not possible (like going left from state 0), I assume it just stays or maybe wraps around? Or perhaps the movement just doesn't happen. Hmm, this might be crucial because it affects how the agent navigates.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 numbers, each indicating the action to take in that state. The challenge is to choose these actions such that the agent maximizes its chance of reaching state 15 without falling into any holes.

Looking at the previous attempts and trajectories provided, it seems like most policies are getting low rewards around 0.25 or less. The optimal reward should be around 1.0, so clearly, there's room for improvement.

In the latest iteration, the policy had a reward of 0.10 with a trajectory that went from (0,0) to (4,1), then to (8,1), and stayed there. This suggests that maybe the agent is getting stuck in certain states or not progressing towards the goal effectively.

I need to think about how to structure the policy so that it navigates efficiently towards state 15 while avoiding holes. Since the environment is slippery, actions don't always result in the intended movement, so the policy needs to account for this uncertainty.

One approach could be to have the agent generally move towards the goal as much as possible. For example, from states near the top-left (0-3), moving right or down might be better since those directions lead closer to state 15. Similarly, in other parts of the grid, the agent should adjust its actions based on proximity to the goal.

I also need to consider where the holes are located because stepping into them ends the episode with no reward. Without knowing their exact positions, the policy must avoid taking actions that could lead to those states. From the trajectories provided, it seems like the agent has encountered some dead-ends or loops, so perhaps adjusting certain state-action pairs can help break these cycles.

Looking at the previous best policies, they often have a mix of actions, but maybe there's a pattern where specific states are being mishandled. For example, if from state 8 (which is in the third row, first column), taking action 2 (up) might lead towards the goal, but perhaps it's better to take another action given the slippery nature.

I think I'll start by assigning actions that generally push the agent towards the right or down since those directions are more likely to lead closer to state 15. For example:

- From states in the top row (0-3), moving right could help reach the goal.
- From states on the leftmost column (0,4,8,12), moving down or right would be better.
- In the bottom-right area, ensuring that actions lead directly to state 15.

But I also need to make sure that these actions don't lead into holes. Without knowing where they are, it's a bit tricky, but perhaps by having the agent explore different paths when possible can help avoid them.

Another consideration is balancing exploration and exploitation. Since we're early in the iteration process (342 out of 5000), maybe exploring more varied policies could provide new information about which states are holes and how to navigate effectively.

I'll propose a policy where each state's action is chosen to move towards increasing row and column indices, but with some variance to handle the slipperiness. For example:

- States in the top-left might take actions that can move them right or down.
- Middle states could have mixed actions to navigate around potential holes.

After considering all this, I'll structure the params array accordingly, ensuring each action is chosen from 0-3 and trying to maximize the chance of reaching state 15 while avoiding loops or dead-ends.
