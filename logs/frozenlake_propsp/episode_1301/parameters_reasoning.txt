You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) and get a reward of +1, while avoiding the holes which end the episode immediately.

First, I need to understand how the environment works. It's a 4x4 grid with states numbered from 0 to 15. Each state has four possible actions: left, down, right, up. However, because the environment is slippery, each action leads to one of three directions with equal probability.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 numbers (params), where each number corresponds to the action taken in that state. The values can be 0, 1, 2, or 3, each representing a different direction.

Looking at the provided data, the current best policies are yielding rewards around 0.45, which is below the target of 1.0. This suggests that the agent isn't reliably reaching the goal and might be falling into holes or getting stuck in loops.

From the trajectories, I notice that some policies lead to long sequences without reaching the goal, indicating possible cycles or paths that don't effectively move towards state 15. For example, one trajectory goes through states 0,4,8,9,10, etc., but doesn't reach 15. Another gets stuck in a loop around states 0 and 1.

Given that the environment is slippery, it's crucial for each state to have an action that maximizes the chance of eventually reaching state 15 without falling into holes. Since the agent can't remember past attempts (stateless), I need to propose a policy that either explores new strategies or optimizes the current best policies.

Since the rewards are still below 0.45, which is significantly lower than 1.0, my role should be more of an "Explorer." This means I should propose parameters that are distinct from previous ones to gather new information about different paths and potential holes.

Looking at the recent params:

- The last policy had params[0] =3, meaning action right (since state 0 is top-left; moving right would go to state 1). But the trajectory showed it fell into a hole or didn't reach the goal. Maybe action 2 instead?

Alternatively, perhaps in some states, choosing different actions could lead towards the goal more effectively.

I think I should consider policies where states near the goal (like 13,14) are set to move right or down to push towards state 15. Also, for states that have holes nearby, their actions should avoid those directions.

For example:

- State 12: If it's on the third row, fourth column, moving up might go back, but perhaps moving right is better if possible.
- State 14: Moving down would take it to state 15, which is the goal. So setting params[14] =3 (down) could be beneficial.

But since each action leads to three possible states with equal probability, I need to choose actions that have the highest chance of moving towards the goal without hitting a hole.

Another thought: Maybe in some middle states like 6 or 7, choosing an action that tends to move right or down would help navigate towards the bottom-right corner.

I'll propose a new policy where certain key states (like those near the end) are set to specific actions. For example:

- State 15 is already the goal.
- Set state 14's action to move down, which directly leads to the goal.
- Ensure that states leading into holes have actions that avoid them.

But since I can't remember previous params, I need to make sure this new policy hasn't been tried before. Looking at the top and recent policies, I'll choose a configuration where some central states (like 6,7) are set to move right or down, while others might vary.

After considering all these factors, here's a proposed new parameter array that explores different paths towards the goal.

params[0]: 1, params[1]: 3, params[2]: 1, params[3]: 3, params[4]: 0, params[5]: 1, params[6]: 2, params[7]: 1, params[8]: 3, params[9]: 1, params[10]: 2, params[11]: 3, params[12]: 1, params[13]: 2, params[14]: 3, params[15]: 3
