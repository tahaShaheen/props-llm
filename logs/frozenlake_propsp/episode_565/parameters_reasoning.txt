You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with the highest possible reward. Since it's a slippery environment, each action leads to one of three directions with equal probability. That makes things a bit tricky because the agent doesn't always end up where they intend.

Looking at the problem statement, I know that the policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers, each corresponding to a state from 0 to 15. Each value must be one of [0,1,2,3], which represent left, down, right, or up respectively. The challenge is to find the optimal set of actions for each state that maximizes the reward.

The global optimal reward should be around 1.0, meaning the agent successfully reaches the goal consistently without falling into any holes. From the examples provided, I can see that some policies are getting an average reward of about 0.3, which is better than others but still far from the target.

I need to consider how the policy behaves in different states. For example, state 15 is the goal and should probably have a specific action, though once reached, the episode ends. States near the edges or corners might be more prone to falling into holes, so the policy needs to avoid those paths.

In the recent attempts, some policies are getting stuck or looping, which suggests that certain actions in key states might not be optimal. For instance, if state 0 is set to action 3 (up), it would move left, down, or right. But moving up from state 0 isn't possible since it's already on the top row, so maybe staying in place isn't helpful.

Looking at the most recent policies, some are getting very low rewards, which indicates they're either falling into holes frequently or not making progress towards the goal. I should try to tweak these policies to make better use of the slippery nature of the environment. Perhaps adjusting certain actions can lead the agent towards the goal more directly without risking falls.

Since the problem is about global optimization and I need to maximize information gain, I should propose a policy that either explores new territories (if rewards are low) or optimizes around the best-performing ones (when rewards approach 1.0). Given that some policies have already achieved around 0.3, which is not too far from 1.0, maybe it's time to start optimizing by tweaking actions in states that currently aren't performing well.

I should ensure that each action suggested doesn't repeat any previous attempts and tries to either avoid holes or guide the agent towards safer paths toward the goal. For example, if a state often leads to a hole with its current action, changing it to another direction might reduce the risk.

After considering all this, I'll propose a new set of actions that balances exploration and exploitation. The next step is to draft the params array accordingly.
