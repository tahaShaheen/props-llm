You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) and get a reward of +1, while avoiding holes which end the episode with 0 reward.

First, I need to understand the movement dynamics because the environment is slippery. Each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability. For example, if the agent takes action 0, it can move down, left, or up each with a 1/3 chance. Similarly for other actions.

Looking at the previous params and their rewards, the highest reward observed was around 0.30, which is still below the target of 1.0. So, there's room for improvement. The agent isn't consistently reaching the goal yet.

I notice that some policies are getting stuck in loops or falling into holes. For example, a policy might keep moving left or right without making progress towards the goal, leading to repeated states and no reward.

I should focus on designing a policy that directs the agent towards the goal while avoiding dangerous states (holes). Since the environment is 4x4, I can think of it as trying to move right and down more often. However, because of the slipperiness, each action has multiple possible outcomes.

Perhaps setting up the policy so that in certain positions, the agent is more likely to head towards the goal direction. For instance, near the top-right corner (state 3), moving right or down would be beneficial. Similarly, near the bottom row, moving right might help reach state 15.

But wait, since each action has three possible outcomes, choosing an action that covers the most promising directions could maximize the chance of reaching the goal. For example, in some states, choosing action 0 (which allows down, left, or up) might not be as effective as choosing action 3 (right, up, left), depending on where the agent is.

I should also consider how to avoid holes. From the examples provided, it seems that certain actions lead to holes, so the policy needs to learn which states are safe and which aren't.

Given that I can only propose a single new params array each iteration, and I need to maximize information gain, perhaps I should vary some of the parameters in a way that tests different paths towards the goal. Maybe changing some key state's actions to see if it leads to better rewards.

Looking at the most recent policies, many have low rewards because they're getting stuck or falling into holes. To break this pattern, maybe I can adjust certain states' actions to nudge the agent towards more promising directions without immediately optimizing for reward.

For example, in state 0 (top-left), moving down might help start moving towards the goal. But considering the slipperiness, action 3 for state 0 allows moving right, down, or left. Alternatively, action 1 allows right, down, or left. Maybe choosing action 1 for state 0 could give a better chance to move right or down.

Similarly, in state 1 (top-middle), perhaps choosing action 3 would encourage moving right or up or left, but since we want to go towards the goal, maybe action 2 is better? Or another option.

I'm also thinking about states near the bottom-right. For example, state 14 (third row, third column). Choosing an action that increases the chance of moving right would be beneficial because state 15 is just one step to the right from 14. So perhaps in state 14, choosing action 3 (which includes right) could help.

But I need to make sure that the chosen actions don't lead into holes. From the examples, some trajectories end quickly due to falling into holes, so avoiding states that lead there is crucial.

Another approach is to structure the policy such that it generally moves towards increasing row and column indices. For example, in earlier rows, encourage moving down or right; in later rows, focus more on moving right to reach state 15.

Let me try constructing a params array step by step:

- State 0 (top-left): Maybe action 3 (right, down, left) because starting towards the right might be better.
- State 1: Action 3 again, pushing towards the right.
- States in the top row (2 and 3): Keep moving right if possible, but need to avoid falling into holes.
- Middle states: Perhaps action 0 or 1, which have a mix of directions that can help move down or right.
- Lower rows: Focus on moving right and up to reach state 15.

Wait, but in some cases, moving down might take the agent closer. For example, in state 4 (second row, first column), moving down would lead to state 8, which is further away from the goal. Maybe it's better to move right or left instead?

Alternatively, maybe a more balanced approach where each action choice increases the chances of making progress towards the goal without getting stuck.

I also need to ensure that the policy doesn't get stuck in loops. For example, if the agent keeps moving between states 4 and 0 (if state 4's action leads back up), it would loop indefinitely without progressing.

Considering all these factors, perhaps a policy where each state is set to an action that maximizes the chance of moving towards the goal direction while avoiding holes. This might involve testing different actions in key positions to see which ones yield better rewards.

Since I can only propose one new params array now, I'll choose some states to adjust their actions based on the above reasoning.
