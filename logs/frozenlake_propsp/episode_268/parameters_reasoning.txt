You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to find the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment using a Q-learning approach with parameterized actions. The policy is represented by an array of 16 values, each corresponding to one of the grid states (from 0 to 15). Each value in this array should be 0, 1, 2, or 3. 

First, I need to understand how Q-learning works with parameterized actions. In standard Q-learning, the agent chooses an action based on the current state and its associated Q-value. Here, instead of fixed actions, each state's action is determined by a parameter in the policy array. The goal is to maximize the expected reward.

The environment is slippery, meaning that when the agent takes any of three possible actions (down, left, up), they don't have equal probability. Instead, it seems that when an action is taken, there are specific probabilities associated with each direction. For example, if the policy for state 0 is 2, which means taking action 2, then moving up has a higher chance than the others? Or wait, no—action 2 picks from [up, right, down]. So perhaps each of these directions has equal probability when action 2 is taken.

Wait, looking back: When action 2 is taken, it chooses among up, right, or down with equal probability. That means if action 2 is selected for a state, the agent will take those three actions equally likely (each with 1/3 chance). Similarly, other actions have their own selection probabilities.

So for each policy parameter value from 0 to 3 in a given state, that state's action is determined by looking up the corresponding index in the policy array. For example, if the policy at state 0 is 2, then the agent will take action 2 when in state 0.

To implement this, I'll need to set up an initial parameter value for each of the 16 states. These parameters should be chosen from {0, 1, 2, 3} and should help guide the agent's exploration through difficult parts of the grid that are blocked (holes). The goal is to maximize the expected reward by exploring these holes efficiently.

I'll start with all parameters set to 0. Then, I'll train for a certain number of iterations, say 400 as specified. During training, after each iteration, I'll evaluate the performance based on the episodic reward obtained. The evaluation should consider both the immediate rewards from explored areas and any future opportunities gained by navigating around holes.

Since the environment is slippery, the agent's exploration needs to be more cautious about the ones leading to holes. By setting parameter values that encourage certain actions when in challenging states, I can help the agent avoid falling into the holes by exploring them more thoroughly.

After several iterations of training with different parameter combinations, I expect the policy will converge towards a set of parameters that maximize the expected reward, allowing the agent to navigate through the frozen lake without falling into the holes. The final output should list the optimal parameters for each state in order from 0 to 15.
