You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. It's a 4x4 grid where the agent can move in four directions, but because it's slippery, each action has three possible outcomes with equal probability. The goal is state 15, which gives a reward of +1, and other states give 0. There are holes that end the episode if stepped on.

First, I need to understand how the environment works. Each state is represented by a number from 0 to 15. The agent's policy is an array of these 16 numbers, each indicating which action (0-3) to take in that state. The tricky part is that because the environment is slippery, taking an action doesn't guarantee moving in one direction; instead, there's a 1/3 chance for three possible directions.

I recall that the optimal policy should maximize the expected reward. Since the goal is to reach state 15, the policy needs to navigate towards it while avoiding holes. From previous knowledge, the optimal strategy often involves moving right and down as much as possible, but in this slippery environment, we have to account for the probabilistic movements.

Looking at the problem statement, the user provided some top-performing policies and recent ones. The best reward so far is 0.45, which is below the target of 1.0, indicating there's room for improvement.

In iteration 936, I need to propose a new set of params. Since the rewards are still low, I should act as an explorer and try configurations that haven't been seen before to gather more information about which states lead to holes or help reach the goal.

I'll start by considering each state and determining the best action based on avoiding holes and moving towards the goal. For example, in state 0 (top-left), choosing action 1 (which allows movement right, down, left) might be beneficial because from there, moving right would take it closer to the goal.

Looking at some states:

- State 0: Being the start, probably want to move right or down. Since action 1 allows both.
- State 3: Close to the top-right corner, so moving down would help towards the goal.
- State 4: In the second row first column; perhaps moving right is better.

But because of the slippery nature, it's hard to predict exact paths. So the policy needs to be robust, ensuring that even with probabilistic movements, it doesn't fall into holes and has a high chance of reaching the goal.

I should ensure that for each state, the chosen action leads towards the goal as much as possible while avoiding states known to have holes. From the trajectories provided, some paths end in holes or take too long, so I need to adjust actions to avoid those paths.

After considering these factors, I'll propose a new set of params where each state's action is chosen to move towards the goal with higher probability, even accounting for the slipperiness. For example, in states near the bottom and right edges, choosing actions that have a high chance of moving down or right.

Let me draft a possible param configuration:

params[0]: 1 (action 1 allows movement right)
params[1]: 3 (action 3 allows up, left, right)
params[2]: 2 (action 2 allows up, right, down)
...
Wait, I need to make sure each action is chosen from [0,1,2,3], and each corresponds to a specific set of possible movements.

I think for state 0, choosing action 1 would allow the agent to move right, down, or left. Moving right is towards the goal, so that's good. Similarly, in state 15, it's already at the goal, but since it's terminal, perhaps no action is needed, but params[15] can be set to any value as it won't be used.

I'll proceed to construct the params array, ensuring each state's action is chosen to move towards the goal while considering the possible movements from each action.
