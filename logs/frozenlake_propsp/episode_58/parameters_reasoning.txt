You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

Do NOT output anything else. No explanation, no reasoning, nothing.



LLM:
<think>
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the environment is a 4x4 grid representing FrozenLake with some holes. The goal is to reach state 15 (bottom-right corner) for a reward of +1, and all other states give 0 except for the holes which end the episode. The agent can move in four directions, but due to slippiness, each action results in one of three possible moves with equal probability.

First, I need to understand how the slippery nature affects movement. For example, taking action 0 (left) could result in moving down, left, or up. This means that even if the agent chooses a specific action, it might not end up where intended, adding an element of randomness and making planning more challenging.

The policy is defined by an array 'params' of length 16, each representing the action to take from state i (0 to 15). The challenge is to find the optimal policy that maximizes the reward, which should ideally be around 1.0 if it can reach the goal reliably without falling into holes.

Looking at the top 3 best performing params provided, they all have f(params) less than or equal to 0.10. This suggests that none of them are consistently reaching the goal state 15, so there's room for improvement. The trajectories show that some policies reach state 8 (third row, first column) and then get stuck or fall into holes.

Since the average reward is low, I should adopt an exploration strategy to find new configurations that haven't been tried before, as per the stateless strategy guidelines. The goal is to maximize information gain by proposing a 'params' array that hasn't been seen yet and might lead to higher rewards.

I notice that in previous attempts, certain states were leading the agent towards dead-ends or holes. For instance, if the policy directs the agent from state 0 (top-left) to move right (action 1), it could end up moving down, left, or somewhere else due to slippiness. Maybe a different action from state 0 would lead towards the goal more effectively.

Let me think about each state and what actions might help avoid holes and move closer to the goal. For example, state 0 (top-left) should probably move right or down to progress towards the goal. However, due to slippiness, moving right could send it elsewhere. Maybe choosing an action that has a higher chance of moving in the desired direction.

Looking at each possible action's outcomes:
- Action 0: down, left, up
- Action 1: right, down, left
- Action 2: up, right, down
- Action 3: left, up, right

I need to choose for each state an action that, considering the probabilities, is more likely to avoid holes and head towards state 15.

For instance, from state 0 (top-left), moving right (action 1) might help get closer. But since it can also move down or left, I should check if those states are safe. Similarly, for other states, the optimal action would depend on avoiding known holes and progressing towards the goal.

Given that the current top policies aren't performing well, I'll propose a new 'params' configuration where each state's action is selected to either directly aim towards the goal or avoid dangerous areas based on previous trajectories. Since I can't remember past attempts, I need to ensure this new configuration hasn't been tried before and offers a unique path.

After considering all these factors, here's a proposed 'params' array that might help the agent explore more effectively and avoid holes while trying to reach the goal.
