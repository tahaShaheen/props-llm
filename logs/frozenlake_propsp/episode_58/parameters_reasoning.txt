You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment using a policy gradient method. The agent is moving in a 4x4 grid, and each action has certain probabilities based on the parameter values provided.

First, let me understand the problem setup. The state is numbered from 0 to 15, corresponding to positions (row, column). The goal is at state 15. Each state gives a reward of +1 if it's not a hole and 0 otherwise. The agent starts randomly, but we're using specific parameters for exploration.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 values where each index corresponds to the action (0-3) in a particular state. For example, params[0] dictates the action when at state 0.

Each iteration increases the number of steps taken, and after each step, we evaluate the total reward using these parameters. The goal is to maximize this reward over multiple trials.

I've seen some examples where different parameter values lead to varying rewards. From those, I notice that sometimes higher actions (like 3) can lead to better rewards, but it also depends on avoiding holes and reaching the goal safely.

Since we're using a policy gradient approach, the parameters guide the agent's exploration. The best reward seems around 0.15 or lower based on the provided examples. So, I need to adjust params[0:3] to encourage moving towards higher values (like 3) while avoiding holes and reaching state 15.

I should consider how each action influences the next state probabilities. For instance, when in a high reward state, an action that leads directly to the goal is preferred. Also, actions that lead into dangerous areas should be avoided.

Maybe I can test some specific parameter configurations. For example, if params[3] (action 3) has higher values, the agent might favor right turns more often. Alternatively, if params[0] increases to encourage moving down, it could help in exploring different paths.

I also notice that parameters around 2 and 1 have certain advantages. It might be beneficial to set these regions high to increase exploration or reinforce movement towards certain directions.

After some experimentation, perhaps setting params[3] higher than others would allow the agent more opportunities to reach the goal, which is crucial since the reward for states with holes is 0. So, avoiding them is important.

I should also consider the probability distribution of each action. Since all actions are equally probable when taking an action (as per the problem statement), focusing on certain high-numbered actions could encourage exploration in those areas and reinforce moving towards better states.

Finally, I think setting params[3] to 1 for some steps might help the agent take right turns more often, which can be beneficial in navigating the grid without getting stuck. This would balance between exploration and following known good paths.
