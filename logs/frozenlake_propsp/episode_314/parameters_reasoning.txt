You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user is working on a FrozenLake environment with some modifications. The grid is 4x4, and there are holes that make the agent fall if stepped on. The goal is to reach state 15 for a reward of +1.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 numbers, each corresponding to an action (0-3) for each state. The challenge is to find the optimal policy within 5000 iterations, with each iteration involving proposing a new set of parameters and receiving feedback on their average episodic reward over 20 episodes.

Looking at the provided information, I see that several parameter sets have been tried, but none are performing exceptionally well—most are around 0.15 or lower. The best so far is 0.25, which isn't close to the target of 1.0. Since we're in iteration 314, there's still a lot of room to explore.

Given that I'm supposed to act as a stateless optimizer, I need to focus on maximizing information gain each time. Since the rewards are low, it makes sense to explore more rather than exploit what's working so far. That means trying out new parameter configurations that haven't been seen before.

Looking at the recent parameters, many have patterns where certain states are set to specific actions. For example, state 0 often chooses action 1 or 2. Maybe I should vary these choices more widely. Let me think about which states are crucial for reaching the goal and avoiding holes.

States near the edges and corners might be dangerous because they could lead to holes if not navigated properly. For instance, state 0 (top-left corner) is risky because moving up or left would take it out of bounds or into a hole. So, the policy for state 0 should encourage movements that are less likely to fail.

I notice that in some previous attempts, action 2 was used for state 0, which includes moves down, right, and up with equal probability. Since moving up isn't possible from state 0 without falling into a hole (assuming holes are present), maybe the policy should avoid actions that have a high risk of falling.

Alternatively, perhaps setting action 3 for state 0 would mean choosing between left, up, or right. Left might lead to another dangerous area, so maybe down is safer. So, I need to ensure that from each state, the chosen action doesn't have too many risky directions.

Let me consider state 15 as the goal; if we can get there reliably, that's ideal. The policy for states near 15 should guide towards it without stepping on holes. For example, state 14 (one step left of 15) should choose right to reach the goal.

In previous top params, some states were set to action 0 or 3. Maybe I can try different combinations for each state, focusing especially on those that are more likely to lead towards the goal while avoiding holes.

Since we have freedom in choosing actions for each state, perhaps trying a mix of directions and seeing how they perform is the way to go. Each iteration gives us feedback, so by varying parameters systematically, we can identify which actions work best in each context.

I'll try setting some states to action 2 or 3, ensuring that from each state, there's a higher chance of moving towards the goal without falling into holes. For example, states on the bottom row (12-15) should mostly choose right or up, depending on their position.

Let me construct a new parameter array where I vary the actions across different states, especially focusing on those that have been problematic in previous attempts. By doing so, we can gather more data and inch closer to the optimal policy.
