You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get the highest possible reward by reaching state 15 without falling into any holes. Let's break down what I know.

First, the environment is a 4x4 grid where each cell represents a state from 0 to 15. Movement isn't straightforward because of the slippery nature—each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability. This adds a layer of uncertainty that makes planning tricky.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 numbers, each indicating the action to take in that state. The actions are 0 (down/left/up), 1 (right/down/left), 2 (up/right/down), and 3 (left/up/right). So for each state, I need to pick one of these four actions.

Looking at the provided data, the best performing policies have an average reward around 0.45, which is significantly below the target of 1.0. That suggests that we're not yet reaching the goal consistently and are probably falling into holes or getting stuck in loops.

The most recent five params didn't perform well, with some even resulting in zero rewards. This indicates they either fell into holes or got stuck moving without progress towards the goal. So, I need to adjust these policies to avoid those issues.

I notice that in the top-performing params, states 0 and 1 are set to action 1 and 3 respectively. Let's think about what that does. Action 1 from state 0 (top-left) would try to move right, down, or left with equal chance. But if moving down is an option (since it's a slippery action), maybe that helps in avoiding the holes below.

Looking at the trajectories, some agents are getting stuck in cycles, like staying on state 0 for multiple steps. That's inefficient and leads to low rewards. So I need policies that encourage movement towards the goal without looping.

Another thing is the slippery nature: choosing an action doesn't guarantee moving in that direction. So the policy needs to account for all possible outcomes. Maybe encouraging actions that, on average, move the agent closer to the goal despite the randomness.

For example, from state 0 (top-left), taking action 1 (right) might help head towards the right side, but considering the slippery effect, it could also go down or left. However, if moving down leads to a hole, that's bad. So maybe I should choose an action that minimizes the risk of falling into holes while having a path towards state 15.

Looking at the grid, the bottom-right (state 15) is the goal. The holes are in certain positions—probably states like 5, 6, 7, etc. So when designing policies, I need to make sure that from each state, the chosen action doesn't have a high probability of leading into those holes.

Maybe focusing on creating a policy that navigates towards state 15 by moving right and down as much as possible without getting stuck or falling into holes. Since movement is probabilistic, I need to find actions that statistically lead closer to the goal.

I also see that some policies are taking longer paths or getting stuck in certain areas. So perhaps adjusting specific states' actions to nudge the agent more directly towards the goal could help.

Given all this, I think I'll propose a new set of params where from each state, the action chosen is the one that statistically has the highest chance of moving towards the goal while avoiding holes. For example, in states near the top, choosing right or down might be better, and in other areas, perhaps left or up if they're closer to the target.

But since I can't remember previous attempts (due to being stateless), I need to choose a policy that's distinct from what's been tried before. So I'll look at the current top params and try to tweak them slightly but effectively.
