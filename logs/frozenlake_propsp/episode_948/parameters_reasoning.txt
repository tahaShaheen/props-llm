You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The environment is a 4x4 grid, with states numbered from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). The goal is state 15, which gives +1 reward, and all other states give 0. But there are holes that end the episode if stepped on. Since the environment is slippery, each action leads to a random direction with equal probability.

The policy is an array of 16 actions (each from 0-3), where each index corresponds to a state's action. The challenge is to find the optimal policy that maximizes the reward by avoiding holes and reaching the goal as often as possible.

Looking at the provided data, the top-performing policies have average rewards around 0.45. This suggests that the current best isn't great but we're making progress. My goal is to propose a new set of params that might improve this.

First, I notice that the policy needs to navigate from any state towards 15 while avoiding holes. Since each action has probabilistic outcomes, it's crucial to choose actions that maximize the chance of moving closer to the goal without falling into holes.

Looking at the most recent policies:

- The last few have low rewards (0.15 and 0.05), so maybe we're stuck or not exploring enough. I should try a more exploratory approach.
- Holes are unknown, but based on trajectories, stepping on certain states ends the episode. So, the policy must avoid actions leading to those holes.

I think of strategies like always moving towards the right and down since that would naturally guide towards state 15. However, due to slipperiness, sometimes you might move in other directions, so it's better to have a mix of right and down actions.

For example:
- For states near the top-left (0,1), maybe action 1 (right) is good.
- States on the first row should probably aim to go right or down, depending on their position.

But I need to be careful not to repeat previous params. So, let me vary some actions in critical states.

Looking at the current best param set:
params[0]:1; ... 
This means state 0 (top-left) takes action 1 (right), which is good since it moves towards higher-numbered states closer to 15.

But maybe for other states, changing actions could help. For instance, in state 4 (row 2, column 0), taking action 0 might be better as it can move down or left or up—though moving down from 4 would go to 8, which is the bottom-left corner. Alternatively, maybe action 3 for state 4 could encourage right movement.

I need to think about each state and decide the best possible action that, on average, leads towards the goal without falling into holes.

Another approach: Since the environment is known, perhaps I can precompute safe paths. For example:

- From state 0 (top-left), moving right (action 1) would go to state 1.
- From state 1, moving down (action 0) might take you to 5 or other states.

But given the slipperiness, each action leads to three possible directions with equal chance. So, for any state, choosing an action that has a higher probability of moving towards the goal would be better.

I think I should try setting as many actions as possible to move right and down, especially in states where that makes sense.

Let me try to create a new params array:

- For states 0: choose right (1)
- States along the top row (0-3): moving right or down
- Middle rows: prioritize moving right or down towards the goal

Wait, but I need to ensure that for each state, the chosen action doesn't lead into a hole. Since I don't know where the holes are, maybe focusing on general movement is better.

Alternatively, perhaps setting all states except those near the goal to move right and down, and those near the goal to move towards 15.

But without knowing hole positions, this is tricky. Maybe it's better to explore a policy that varies actions in different parts of the grid to maximize information gain.

Given the current best reward isn't close to 1.0, I should try exploring more by varying the params to see which states are leading to holes or not.

So, I'll propose a new set where some key states have different actions than before, focusing on moving towards the goal but also changing direction in certain spots to avoid potential traps.
