You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I need to figure out how to approach this problem. The user is asking for the optimal policy in a FrozenLake environment using an episodic reward function. The agent's action space includes moving left, down, right, or up with some probabilities when certain states are encountered. Also, there are holes on the map that can trap the agent.

First, I recall that in such environments, exploration is crucial to find these holes. The agent should not just follow a fixed policy but actively explore different actions to avoid getting stuck. Since the policy parameters are given as an array of 16 values representing actions for each state (0-15), my task is to set them optimally.

I remember that in reinforcement learning, one common approach is Q-learning or policy gradient methods likeActor-Lambda or PPO. However, since the user mentioned a specific setup where parameters are from [0,1,2,3], I think it's referring to a simpler method where each parameter can be set independently but constrained within this range.

The goal is to maximize the episodic reward. So, for states without holes (non-whole states), taking action 0 (move down) gives 0 reward, action 1 (right/down/left) also 0, and action 3 (left/up/right) gives +1. For the top-left state (0,0), the possible actions are [0,1,2], but I think the policy should prefer action 3 to explore more.

I realize that without knowing which states are holes, it's hard to set specific parameters for each state, but perhaps certain patterns emerge from the given best-performing params. For instance, some higher parameters might be associated with exploring more.

Wait, in the examples provided, parameters like [2,0,3,2] seem to prioritize action 2 (up) or other options when on certain states. But without knowing which are holes, it's speculative.

I decide that the optimal policy would involve maximizing the reward by sometimes moving into hole states to learn and avoid them in future. So, setting parameters like params[1] (right/down/left) to a higher value might encourage some exploration there.

But considering the slippery nature of the environment, each action still has equal probability when certain states are reached, except for those on 0 or 3 which have different rewards. So, perhaps actions that lead into holes should be prioritized more by setting their parameters higher.

I also note that action 2 (up) is in a corner and can trap the agent if not explored, so it's crucial to try it early.

Putting this together, I think the optimal policy would have some parameters set to higher values when possible, especially for actions leading into holes. So, for states where down and left are beneficial, action 0 might be taken more often, while up could be prioritized in certain spots.
