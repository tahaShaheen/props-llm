You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help optimize the policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me first understand the problem. The environment is a 4x4 grid where each cell can be in one of several states, some of which are holes leading to game over. The agent's goal is to reach state 15, giving a reward of +1, while all other states give 0. The policy is a function that maps each state (from 0 to 15) to an action (0-3), and I need to find the optimal set of actions to maximize the average episodic reward.

From the problem description, I know that the environment is slippery, meaning when the agent takes an action, it has a 1/3 chance to move in one of three directions. So each action choice isn't straightforward because there's uncertainty in where the agent will end up.

The user provided some previous attempts and their rewards. The top-performing params had an average reward around 0.35, which is relatively low since the goal is to reach 1.0. This suggests that the current policies aren't consistently reaching the goal state within a reasonable number of steps.

Looking at the recent trials, most of them either fell into holes or didn't reach the goal efficiently. For example, one trajectory had the agent stuck in a loop without progressing towards the goal. Another trajectory ended quickly because it fell into a hole.

Given that I need to maximize information gain and explore new policies, especially since the rewards are still below 1.0, I should consider generating a policy that explores different paths and avoids holes more effectively. 

I remember from previous knowledge in RL that policies often need to balance exploration and exploitation. Since the current reward isn't close to optimal, I'm in the 'exploration' phase, so I should vary actions to see new states and outcomes.

One approach is to design a policy where each state has an action that moves towards the goal but also allows for some variance. For example, states closer to the bottom-right (state 15) might have more direct actions, while others might take different paths.

I'll consider setting certain states to specific actions that are likely to move them closer to the goal without immediate risk of falling into holes. However, since the environment is slippery, I need to choose actions that give a good chance of moving in the intended direction but also have backup options if they slip.

Looking at state 0 (top-left), it's best to try moving down or right. But considering slippiness, action 1 for state 0 might be better because it includes right as one of the three possible moves. Similarly, states near the edges should have actions that keep them within bounds to avoid falling into holes.

I'll go through each state and assign an action that, on average, increases the chances of moving towards the goal while minimizing falls into holes. For example:

- States in the top row (0-3) might benefit from right or down actions.
- Middle rows should aim to move closer to the bottom-right, using left/right/down as appropriate.

I need to ensure that the proposed params haven't been tried before and are distinct enough to provide new information. From the previous attempts, certain patterns have been used, so I'll vary them.

Finally, I'll construct a new set of params where each state's action is chosen to either move towards the goal or explore alternative paths, ensuring a good balance between exploration and potential progress.
