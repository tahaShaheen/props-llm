You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, let's try to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. So, from what I understand, it's a 4x4 grid where the agent can move in four directions, but because of the slippery nature, each action leads to one of three possible moves with equal probability. The goal is state 15, and there are some holes that end the episode if stepped on.

Looking at the problem statement, the policy is defined by an array of 16 integers, each representing the action taken in states 0 to 15. The actions are 0 (down/left/up), 1 (right/down/left), 2 (up/right/down), and 3 (left/up/right). Each action has three possible outcomes.

The user provided some previous examples of policies along with their rewards and trajectories. From the top 4 best-performing params, I notice that they have varying actions but all seem to be trying to navigate towards state 15 without falling into holes. The most recent policies, however, are yielding lower rewards, around 0.00 or 0.05, which suggests that perhaps those policies aren't effective.

The goal is to reach the global optimal policy with a reward of around 1.0, meaning it's reaching the goal consistently without falling into holes. Since we're at iteration 600 out of 5000, there's still time to explore and optimize.

Given that I'm supposed to act as an optimizer now because the rewards are below but not extremely far from 1.0, I should tweak the best parameters slightly. Looking at the top params, one had a reward of 0.30, which is relatively decent but not optimal yet.

I think the key here is to ensure that each state's action choice leads towards state 15 without stepping into any holes. Since actions are probabilistic, the policy needs to choose actions that maximize the chance of moving towards the goal while minimizing the risk of falling into a hole.

Looking at state 15 as the goal, it should probably have no action since once reached, the episode ends. But in the params, it's still set to an action, which might not be necessary but perhaps for safety, I'll keep it as is.

I'll need to analyze each state and determine which action gives the best chance of moving towards 15 without hitting a hole. For example, states near the bottom-right should push towards state 15. Let me try to map out possible actions:

- State 14 (third row, third column) is adjacent to state 15. So from here, moving right or up might be better, but considering the slippery nature, it's better to choose an action that can reach 15.

Wait, actually, in a 4x4 grid, state 14 is the cell above state 15. So from state 14, moving down should lead directly to 15. But since actions are probabilistic, choosing an action that has a higher chance of moving down or right might help.

Similarly, for other states, I need to choose actions that statistically increase the likelihood of reaching state 15 without hitting holes. It's a bit tricky because each action can lead in three directions, so it's about balancing between exploration and exploitation.

Looking at the best previous policies, they had varying combinations of actions, but perhaps some patterns emerge where certain states consistently choose specific actions that work better than others. For example, in state 0 (top-left), choosing action 1 might help move right or down, which could be beneficial.

Since I'm supposed to maximize information gain and avoid repeating previous params, maybe I should try a new combination of actions for some key states while keeping the working parts intact.

Let me try adjusting a few states:

- State 0: Maybe action 1 (right/down/left) since right moves towards the goal.
- State 3: Action 3 could help move left/up/right, which might navigate around holes.
- States near the bottom-right should push down or right to reach state 15.

But I'm not entirely sure about each state's optimal action. Perhaps a more systematic approach would be better, but given the constraints of being stateless and only seeing previous examples, it's challenging.

After considering all this, I'll propose a new set of params that tweaks some actions from the top-performing policies to see if we can get closer to the optimal reward.
