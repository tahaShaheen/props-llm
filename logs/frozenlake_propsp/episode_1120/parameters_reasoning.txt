You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with a reward of +1, avoiding holes along the way. The environment is slippery, meaning each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability.

First, I need to understand how the policy works. Each state from 0 to 15 has an action (0-3) that the agent takes. The challenge is figuring out which actions in each state will maximize the reward by reaching the goal without falling into any holes.

Looking at the top 5 best performing params, I see they have a reward of around 0.45, which is below the target of 1.0. So, the current policies are not optimal yet. The most recent params didn't perform well, yielding rewards like 0.00 and 0.25. This suggests that the agent is either falling into holes or getting stuck in loops.

I should consider what makes a policy optimal. It needs to navigate from any starting point towards state 15 without stepping on holes. Given the slippery nature, each action choice must account for multiple possible movements. For example, if a state is near the edge, certain actions might have a higher chance of leading out of bounds or into holes.

Looking at the trajectories provided, many end in loops or fall into holes. This indicates that some policies aren't handling the slippery transitions well. To improve this, I should design policies where each action choice leads towards 15 as much as possible, considering the probabilities of each movement.

I think a good starting point is to map out safe paths from each state. For instance, states near the goal (like 12, 13, 14) might have higher chances of reaching 15 if they move right or down (depending on their position). But because of the slippery nature, I need to choose actions that statistically increase the chance of moving towards the goal.

Let me consider each state and decide which action would best navigate towards 15:

- For states in row 0 (top row), moving down is essential since up would take them out of bounds.
- States on the rightmost column should move right to reach 15, but since it's slippery, their actions might vary.
- Middle states need a balance between moving right and down.

I also need to avoid actions that lead into holes. From the trajectories, some states seem to have high risks when taking certain actions. For example, state 0 taking action 2 (which can move up) might be risky if it leads out of bounds or into a hole.

To maximize information gain, I should propose params that are significantly different from previous ones to explore new paths. However, given the current best reward is 0.45, which is not close to 1.0, perhaps I need to tweak parameters near high-reward regions.

Wait, no—since rewards are below 1.0, according to the rules, if they're far from 1.0, I should be in "Explorer" mode, ignoring specific values and choosing distinct configurations to gather new information.

So, I'll try to vary actions across states, ensuring that each choice statistically increases the chance of moving towards 15 while avoiding holes.

Let me draft a possible set of params:

- For state 0 (top-left), moving right or down. Since it's top-left, moving right is better.
- State 1: Maybe move down to avoid getting stuck on the left side.
- States in row 3 should focus on moving towards the goal.

But I'm not sure about all of them. Maybe a more systematic approach would help. Let me list each state and choose actions that generally push towards 15, considering their positions.

Alternatively, perhaps using a greedy approach where each action is chosen to maximize the immediate chance of reaching the goal, even if it's probabilistic.

I think I'll propose a policy where most states in the bottom row move right or down as needed, and middle states prioritize moving towards the goal. I should also ensure that actions don't lead into holes based on previous trajectories.

Wait, without knowing the exact positions of the holes, this is tricky. But from the examples given, certain transitions led to falling into holes. So, for example, if state 0 takes action 3 (which can move left or up or right), but moving left would take it back to itself, while moving up might be a hole.

Alternatively, maybe the optimal policy requires careful consideration of each state's possible moves and their probabilities.

Given all this, I think the next step is to propose a new set of params that differs significantly from previous ones, focusing on getting to 15 while avoiding risky actions that lead into holes.
