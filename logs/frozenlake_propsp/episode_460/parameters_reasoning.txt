You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help optimize the policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me try to break down what's going on here.

First, the environment is a 4x4 grid, and the agent can move in four directions—up, down, left, right. But because it's slippery, each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability. The goal is state 15 (bottom-right corner), which gives +1 reward, while all other states give 0. There are also holes that end the episode if stepped on.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 parameters, each representing the action taken in a specific state. Each parameter can be 0,1,2,3 corresponding to the four possible actions. The challenge is to find the optimal set of these parameters that maximizes the reward.

Looking at the provided data, it seems like previous attempts have resulted in average rewards around 0.20-0.30. The goal is to reach close to 1.0, so there's room for improvement.

The top-performing policies so far have trajectories that either quickly reach the goal or avoid holes but don't consistently get to state 15. For example, one policy with f(params) of 0.30 had a trajectory ending at state 8 (params[8]:3), which is not the goal.

I need to think about what states are leading towards the goal and which actions can help avoid holes. The agent needs a strategy that moves towards state 15 without falling into any holes.

Let me consider each state:

- State 0: top-left corner. To get to the goal, it should probably move right or down.
- State 1: top-middle. Moving right is better towards the goal.
- Similarly for other states: moving in directions that lead closer to state 15 while avoiding holes.

But because of the slippery nature, each action has a 33% chance to go three different ways, so the policy needs to choose actions that have the highest probability of eventually reaching the goal without hitting a hole.

Looking at previous attempts, policies that tend to move towards the right and down are better. For instance, in state 0, choosing action 1 (right) might be better than others because it directly moves closer to the goal.

Wait, but looking back at the top params, some have action 2 for state 0, which is up. That's confusing because moving up from state 0 would take it outside the grid or maybe loop? Or perhaps in this setup, moving up from state 0 might not be allowed or leads to a hole.

I need to figure out which states are holes. The problem statement mentions that some states are holes but doesn't specify which ones. So I have to deduce them based on the trajectories provided.

Looking at the most recent policies and their trajectories, I can infer which states are holes by seeing where the episodes ended in failure. For example:

- In one trajectory, the agent went from state 0 to action 1 (right), leading to state 4. Then action 2 (up) would take it back to state 0, creating a loop. But since the episode didn't end in a hole but continued, perhaps state 0 is not a hole.

Wait, no—the trajectory for one policy was: (0,1) (4,3). So from state 4, action 3 leads to some state. If it's a hole, the agent would have ended there, but instead, it moved on. So maybe holes are in certain states like 5 or others.

Alternatively, perhaps the holes are at states that when entered cause termination. For example, if an agent steps into state 5, which is (0,2), maybe that's a hole because in one of the trajectories, stepping onto state 5 led to failure.

Wait, let me look again. One trajectory was: (0,3) (1,3). If (1,3) is a hole, then it would have terminated there. But in some cases, agents moved into these states without termination, so perhaps those aren't holes.

This is a bit confusing. Since the exact positions of holes aren't given, I need to make assumptions based on the trajectories.

Looking at the top 6 best policies:

- The first policy had a trajectory ending at state 8 (params[8]:3), which suggests that moving from state 4 with action 2 leads there.
- Another ended at state 15, but it's unclear if that was achieved or not because the reward is only 0.30.

Wait, no—rewards are based on reaching state 15. So if an agent reaches state 15, they get +1. The higher rewards are closer to that.

Given that, I need policies that have a high chance of moving towards state 15 without stepping into holes.

Perhaps the optimal strategy is to move right and down as much as possible because those directions lead towards the goal. But due to the slippery nature, each action has multiple possibilities, so the policy must choose actions that maximize the probability of reaching state 15 while avoiding holes.

Looking at previous policies, some had high rewards but didn't reach the goal consistently. So maybe adjusting certain states' actions could help push the agent closer.

For example, in state 14 (third row, third column), choosing action 2 (up) might not be ideal because it would take the agent back a row; instead, moving right or down is better. But considering the grid structure, from state 14, moving right leads to state 15, so action 2 (right) is optimal.

Wait, no—the states go 0-3 (top), 4-7 (second), 8-11 (third), 12-15 (bottom). So state 14 is the third row, second column. From there, moving right would take it to state 15, which is the goal.

Therefore, in state 14, action 0 might be down, but that would take it to 15? Or wait: each state's possible moves depend on their position.

Alternatively, perhaps I should map out all states and determine the best actions for each to reach the goal while avoiding holes.

But without knowing which states are holes, this is challenging. However, from the trajectories, some policies have ended in certain ways that suggest certain states might be problematic.

For example, one trajectory was (0,1) (4,2) (8,2). So state 8 with action 2 leads to another state. If that led to a hole, it would have terminated there.

Alternatively, maybe the agent fell into a hole at some point, so I need to ensure that the chosen actions don't lead to those states.

Given all this uncertainty, perhaps a good strategy is to make sure that in each state, the action chosen has a higher probability of moving towards state 15 without falling into any known problematic states.

Looking back at previous policies, some had high rewards but didn't reach the goal. So maybe adjusting certain parameters can help push the agent towards the goal more directly.

I think for this iteration, to explore new configurations, I'll choose a set of actions that encourages moving right and down as much as possible while avoiding loops or states that have previously led to failures.

So let's construct a policy where:

- States closer to the bottom-right (like 12,13,14,15) take actions towards 15.
- Middle states move right or down.
- Avoid actions that could lead back to previous rows unless necessary.

Let me try defining params as follows:

params[0]: action 1 (right)
params[1]: action 2 (down)
params[2]: action 3 (some combination)
Wait, no—each action corresponds to a specific movement. Let me clarify the action definitions again.

Action 0: move down, left, up with equal probability.
Action 1: right, down, left.
Action 2: up, right, down.
Action 3: left, up, right.

So each action has three possible outcomes. To maximize progress towards state 15, which is at the bottom-right, we want actions that increase the row (down) and column (right).

Thus:

- For states in the top rows, prefer actions that move down or right.
- For states in the left columns, prefer actions that move right or down.

For example:

- State 0: action 1 (right has a chance to go to state 1; down goes to state 4)
- State 1: action 3 (right is possible)
- Etc.

But given the slippery nature, it's hard to predict exact moves. So perhaps choosing actions that have a higher probability of moving towards the goal.

Looking at previous best policies, some had high rewards but didn't reach the goal often. Maybe tweaking certain states' actions can help increase the chances.

Given all this, I think I'll propose a new set of parameters where most states choose actions that prioritize right and down movements to push towards state 15, avoiding loops or moves that could lead into holes.
