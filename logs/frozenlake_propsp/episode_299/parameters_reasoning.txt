You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to find the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15, which is the bottom right corner, and each state gives a reward of 0 except for the start state (0) which gives +1. There are some holes in the map that can be stepped on, ending the game if you do so.

The policy is represented by an array where each element corresponds to a state from 0 to 15. The value at params[i] determines the action to take when in state i. I can only adjust four parameters (params[0], [1], [2], [3]), and my goal is to find the best combination that maximizes the expected reward.

First, I need to understand how the policy works. Each parameter corresponds to a different action:
- params[0]: pick from move down, left, up.
- params[1]: pick from right, down, left.
- params[2]: pick from up, right, down.
- params[3]: pick from left, up, right.

But the key here is that each action has a certain probability. For example, when you're in state i (0-15), you choose an action based on which parameter's value you set and then generate a random choice among the selected actions with equal probability.

The challenge is to find the combination of these four parameters that maximizes the expected reward over time, avoiding stepping into any hole. Since it's a probabilistic policy, I need to explore different combinations and see which one leads to the highest average reward.

I remember from previous knowledge that the optimal policy in such environments often involves exploring neighboring states when stuck, to discover if there are paths leading towards the goal without hitting holes. So maybe the optimal policy is where each parameter is set based on certain conditions—like not being too aggressive with sticking to a single direction (params[0], [1], etc.).

Looking at the examples provided, some policies have parameters like [2]: 3 and others having [0] as 2 or [2] as 1. It seems that balancing exploration and exploitation is key. If I set all parameters to 2, maybe that leads to a policy where each action is equally likely in certain directions, but perhaps it's too conservative and doesn't explore enough.

I also notice that some policies result in a reward of 0.35 or 0.25, which are lower than others. So, the challenge is not just about finding any optimal combination but one where the policy actually reaches the goal without hitting holes more often.

Maybe I should focus on setting each parameter to values that encourage exploration when the current action leads back into a hole. For example, if choosing down from params[0] and landing in a hole, then adjusting params[0] up would make it less likely to land there again.

But since I can't know which parameters will cause future holes, maybe I should set them in a way that initially explores all possibilities before settling into a strategy. Perhaps starting with balanced values for each parameter and gradually increasing some might help discover different paths.

Another approach is to consider that the optimal policy should have certain properties. For example, when at state 14 (top right), taking action down would lead back into a hole unless params[3] is set high. So perhaps params[3] needs to be higher in that area.

Similarly, near the bottom left, taking action up might lead back to a hole if not handled properly. So maybe params[2] should be higher when in certain states.

I'm also thinking about using a brute-force approach by trying all possible combinations of 0-1 for each parameter and seeing which one gives the best average reward. But that's computationally intensive, so I might need to find a smarter way.

Perhaps there's a pattern in the examples where higher parameters result in better exploration (higher params) but sometimes lead to more deterministic actions. It depends on how the holes are arranged around each state. Without knowing which states have holes, it's tricky, but focusing on ensuring that any action not taken is either towards the goal or leads to a hole.

In summary, my strategy should involve:
1. Starting with parameters set based on balancing exploration and exploitation.
2. Testing different combinations by adjusting each parameter's value (0-1) to see which yields the highest average reward.
3. Being cautious about states that lead into holes and adjust parameters accordingly.
4. Iterating this process until I find a policy that consistently reaches the goal without hitting holes, leading to an optimal reward.

I'll start by setting each parameter as 2 (moderately exploring) and see how it performs. If that doesn't yield high rewards, I'll experiment with increasing some parameters or balancing them differently.
