You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help optimize a policy for the FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right corner) with the highest possible reward. The environment is slippery, meaning each action taken results in one of three directions chosen randomly. There are holes that end the episode if stepped on, so avoiding them is crucial.

First, I need to understand the current state of the policy based on the provided data. The user has shared some top-performing params and recent ones along with their rewards. From this, I can see that the best performing policies have an average reward around 0.45, which is lower than the target of 1.0. This suggests that we're still in the exploration phase.

Looking at the most recent policies:

1. The first recent policy had a reward of 0.00 and took a trajectory that went from (0,3) to various states ending up in state 3 with action 0. This seems like it's not reaching the goal but rather moving left or down, possibly hitting a hole.

2. The second recent policy also resulted in a 0.00 reward, with a very long trajectory that didn't reach the goal and ended without any reward, likely because it fell into a hole or stayed too long without progress.

3. The third recent policy achieved a 0.15 reward by reaching state 8 (params[8] is action 3), but then got stuck moving around without reaching the goal.

Given that these recent policies aren't performing well, we're likely in an exploration phase where we need to find new configurations that can lead closer to the goal or avoid holes more effectively.

I should focus on proposing a policy that either finds a path towards state 15 while avoiding known holes. Since the environment is slippery and actions are probabilistic, each action choice needs to have a high chance of moving towards the goal without stepping into a hole.

Looking at the current best params (params[0] to params[15]), I see that some states are set to specific actions. For example, state 0 has action 1, which from the problem description translates to choosing right, down, or left with equal probability. But since state 0 is at the top-left corner, moving right (to state 1) or down (to state 4) might be better.

I need to think about each state and decide the best action that maximizes the chance of reaching state 15 without falling into a hole. However, since I don't know where the holes are exactly, I should look for trajectories that either reach the goal or end in a hole to infer their locations.

For instance, if a trajectory ends because it fell into a hole after taking certain actions from specific states, we can adjust those states' actions to avoid moving towards the hole. But since the user hasn't provided info on which exact states are holes, I need to make educated guesses based on trajectories.

In the top-performing params, state 4 is set to action 0, which would move the agent down, right, or up. If that leads the agent to a hole, maybe changing it to another direction could help. Similarly, other states might have actions leading towards dangerous areas.

To explore further, I should propose a new policy where certain key states are adjusted. For example, state 0: if action 1 isn't working well (as seen in recent params), perhaps setting it to action 3 (which moves left, up, or right) could give more flexibility. Alternatively, maybe action 2 would push the agent towards moving up or right.

I'll consider each state and think about the best possible action that can lead closer to state 15 while avoiding probable holes. Since I don't have exact hole locations, I should focus on general movement towards the goal.

After considering all states, I'll propose a new set of params where certain critical states (like those near the edges or potential paths) are adjusted. For example:

- State 0: Maybe action 2 to try moving up or right.
- State 15: Since it's the goal, perhaps setting it to any action doesn't matter as once reached, the episode ends.

I'll also ensure that I don't repeat any previous params and that each proposed set is distinct to maximize information gain for future iterations.
