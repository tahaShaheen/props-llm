You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to help find the global optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment using a stateless RL approach. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward by reaching state 15 without falling into any holes. 

First, let's understand the problem. The agent moves on a 4x4 grid (states 0-15). Actions are taken with some probabilities because of the slippery nature. Each action leads to three possible directions with equal chance. The policy is an array of 16 elements where each element determines the action for that state.

The best reward we can get is around 1.0, which means reaching the goal in every episode. However, from the top 5 params and their trajectories provided, it looks like none are achieving this yet. Most have rewards around 0.35-0.45, which suggests there's room for improvement.

Looking at the recent params, some trajectories end quickly without reaching the goal or falling into holes. For example, the most recent param leads to a trajectory that goes in circles without making progress towards state 15.

Since we're in iteration 1170 out of 5000 and rewards are still below optimal, I should act as an "Explorer" by proposing new params different from previous ones. The idea is to maximize information gain by exploring new configurations that might lead to better outcomes.

I need to think about which states are crucial for reaching the goal. State 15 is the target, but also, being in a position where actions can reliably move towards it despite the slipperiness is key. Maybe focusing on states near the bottom right would help.

For example, state 12 is at the bottom left of the last row. From there, moving right (action 0) might lead to state 13, but due to slipperiness, it could go down, left, or up. Similarly, for state 14, moving right (action 3) can get to 15, which is the goal.

I should set params such that states near the bottom have actions that push towards the right or down. Also, I need to ensure that from other states, the agent moves in directions that could lead closer to state 15 without getting stuck in loops or falling into holes.

Perhaps setting params for the last few states (12-15) to move right or down might help. Let me try modifying some of these to see if it improves the trajectory.

Looking at the previous attempts, many have params[15] set to 3, which could be moving up, but that's not helpful since we're already at the goal. Maybe setting params[14] and params[12] to move right would help get to state 15.

I'll propose a new param where key states are adjusted to push towards the goal. For instance:
- State 0 (top left) could go down (action 0)
- State 1 (top middle) could go down or right
- Ensure that states near the bottom have actions leading to state 15.

After considering, I'll set up params where most states move towards increasing their row number or moving right when possible. This might help navigate towards the goal more effectively.
