You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy parameters for the FrozenLake environment based on the information given. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward by reaching state 15, while avoiding the holes.

First, I need to understand the setup. It's a 4x4 grid with states numbered from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). Each state has actions that are slippery, meaning each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability. The rewards are +1 for reaching state 15 and 0 otherwise, except when falling into a hole which ends the episode.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 parameters, each representing the action taken in the corresponding state. Each parameter can be 0, 1, 2, or 3, corresponding to the four possible actions (left, down, right, up). The challenge is to find the optimal set of these parameters that maximizes the average reward over multiple episodes.

Looking at the provided information, I see a list of top-performing params and their rewards. The best so far have an average reward of 0.45, which is below the target of 1.0. This suggests that there's room for improvement and we're not yet at the optimal policy.

In the most recent iterations, some policies are getting rewards as low as 0, indicating they might be falling into holes or taking paths that don't lead to the goal efficiently. The trajectories show that some agents are stuck in loops or moving towards states that aren't productive.

To improve, I should consider what actions lead closer to state 15 and avoid the holes. For example, in state 0 (top-left), moving right (action 1) could be beneficial because it takes the agent towards state 3, which is closer to the goal. Similarly, in other states, choosing actions that generally move downward or to the right would help navigate towards the bottom-right corner.

I also need to ensure that the chosen actions don't lead into known holes. From the trajectories provided, some agents fall into loops or get stuck near the edges. So, I should analyze which states are considered safe and which ones aren't.

Looking at the recent policies, they sometimes take the same action multiple times, leading to repetitive paths. To break out of these loops, varying the actions might help, but in a structured way that still moves towards the goal.

One approach is to set up a deterministic policy where each state chooses an action that has the highest probability of eventually reaching the goal without falling into a hole. Since the environment is slippery, the agent's path isn't entirely controlled by its choices, but selecting actions that generally progress towards the goal increases the chances.

For example:
- In state 0 (top-left), moving right (action 1) would take it to state 3.
- From state 3, moving down (action 0 or 2) might lead to states closer to the bottom row.
- Along the way, ensuring that actions avoid moving into known hole positions.

I should also consider states near the goal. Once in state 15, the agent has reached the target, so no further action is needed. But for states adjacent to it, like 14 and 13, choosing right or down (depending on their position) would be optimal.

Given that the best reward so far is 0.45, I need a strategy that can push this closer to 1.0. Maybe adjusting certain key states' actions could lead to more consistent progress towards the goal.

I'll focus on setting up a policy where each state's action moves the agent in a direction that generally progresses towards state 15, considering the slipperiness and hole positions.
