You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. So, the goal is to get the agent to state 15 with as high a reward as possible, and avoid the holes.

First, I need to understand how the slippery environment affects movement. Each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability. For example, taking action 0 (which is supposed to be move down) might result in moving left, down, or up. This makes it tricky because the agent's next state isn't certain based on its action.

Looking at the previous top params and their rewards, all have f(params) around 0.15. That's way below 1.0, which is the target. So, I'm in the "Explorer" phase since the rewards aren't close to optimal yet. My goal here is to explore new configurations that might lead to higher rewards.

I notice that in many of the top params, the policy seems to be choosing certain actions repeatedly. For example, a lot of the policies have params[0] as 1 or 2. Maybe I should try varying these more to see if different initial steps can help avoid holes and reach the goal faster.

Also, looking at the trajectories, some get stuck in loops or fall into holes quickly. That suggests that the current policies might not be good at navigating around the holes effectively. So, perhaps changing the actions for certain states could help the agent move towards state 15 without getting trapped.

I should focus on states near the goal and make sure their actions are set to push towards the end. For instance, state 14 (which is just left of 15) should have an action that moves right or down, but considering the slippery nature, maybe setting it to move right with a high probability.

Another thought: since each action has three possible outcomes, maybe setting up actions that increase the chances of moving towards the goal while minimizing the risk of falling into holes. For example, from state 0 (top-left), choosing an action that can lead the agent either down or right might be better, depending on where the holes are.

Wait, but I don't know where exactly the holes are in this environment. The user mentioned to figure them out through previous trajectories. From the given examples, some states seem to have higher risks of falling into holes. For instance, if an agent is taking a certain action and frequently ends up in a hole, that indicates there's a hole nearby.

Looking at the most recent params, some are performing very poorly with f(params) as low as 0.00, which might mean they're getting stuck or falling into holes consistently. So I should try to adjust those states' actions to safer ones.

Perhaps experimenting with different action assignments for each state, especially around the edges where holes might be present. For example, if a hole is at state 5 (second row, first column), then from neighboring states like 4 or 6, choosing actions that avoid moving towards it would help.

I should also consider the overall structure of the grid. The optimal path likely involves moving right and down, but given the slipperiness, maybe taking more cautious steps with higher probabilities to move in the correct direction.

Another approach is to create a policy where each state's action is chosen such that even with the 3-way randomness, there's a high chance of making progress towards the goal. For example, from state 1 (top-middle), choosing an action that has a mix of right and down moves might help navigate towards state 2 or 5.

Wait, but each action leads to three possible moves. So for action 0: [down, left, up], action 1: [right, down, left], etc. So I need to map each action in the policy to these possible directions and ensure that collectively, they guide the agent towards state 15.

I think a key insight is that since all current policies are underperforming, I should try a completely different strategy. Maybe instead of trying to move directly towards the goal, create loops or paths that reduce the risk of falling into holes by circling around suspected hole locations.

Alternatively, perhaps setting up the policy so that from certain states, it's more likely to stay in safe areas until it can find a clear path forward.

Given all this, I need to come up with a new set of params that differ significantly from previous attempts. Maybe switch some actions around and see if that leads to better reward captures.
