You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me start by understanding the problem thoroughly.

The environment is a 4x4 grid where each cell represents a state from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). The goal is to reach state 15, which gives a reward of +1. All other states give 0. However, there are holes in the grid that end the episode if stepped on.

The agent's actions aren't straightforward because of the slippery nature. Each action taken by the agent doesn't directly lead to the intended movement but instead has an equal chance of moving in three directions. For example, taking action 0 could result in moving down, left, or up with equal probability.

Given that the policy is represented as a list of 16 integers (params), each corresponding to the action taken in states 0 through 15, my task is to find the optimal set of actions that maximizes the episodic reward. The reward should ideally be around 1.0, meaning the agent successfully reaches state 15 without falling into any holes.

Looking at the history provided:

- The top-performing policies have rewards ranging from 0.20 to 0.30.
- Recent policies are performing worse, with some even getting 0.00 or 0.05.
- Trajectories show that agents often get stuck in loops or fall into holes.

My strategy is to suggest a policy that guides the agent towards state 15 while avoiding known holes. Since we don't have specific information about where the holes are, I need to make educated guesses based on common FrozenLake setups, which typically have holes around states like 2 (right of the start), 7 (leftmost bottom row), and others.

I recall that in standard FrozenLake, the optimal path often involves moving right or down towards the goal. However, due to the slippery nature here, the agent's actions are probabilistic, so I need policies that increase the chances of moving closer to state 15 without risking falling into holes.

Let me think about each state and what action would be safest:

- State 0 (top-left): To move right or down. But since it's slippery, taking an action that has a higher chance of moving towards the goal might be better.
- States in the top row: They should aim to move down or right to avoid falling into holes below.
- Middle states: Actions should balance movement towards the goal while avoiding edges where holes are likely.

I need to create a policy where each state's action is chosen to maximize the probability of reaching state 15 without hitting a hole. Since we don't know the exact locations, I'll make assumptions based on standard FrozenLake setups.

After considering all this, here's a possible optimal policy:

params[0]: 2 (action 2 for state 0)
...
I need to assign each state an action from 0-3 that helps move towards the goal while avoiding risky moves. For example, in states near the edges, actions should avoid moving into likely hole positions.

But since I can't remember previous attempts and must choose without any prior knowledge beyond what's provided, I'll suggest a policy where each state is set to an action that primarily aims towards the center or the goal, with some randomness to explore.
