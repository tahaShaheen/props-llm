You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy parameters for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to maximize the reward by getting the agent to state 15 without falling into any holes. From what I understand, each action taken has a 33% chance of moving in one of three directions due to the slippery nature of the environment.

Looking at the examples provided, it seems like most policies aren't performing very well. The highest reward so far is 0.20, which is way below the target of 1.0. This suggests that the current strategies are either not reaching the goal consistently or falling into holes too often.

I remember that in such grid worlds, a common approach is to have policies that guide the agent towards the goal while avoiding known holes. Since the environment is slippery, the policy needs to account for the probabilistic movements and choose actions that statistically increase the chances of reaching the goal.

In the top-performing examples, I notice that certain states are being set to specific actions. For instance, state 0 (top-left corner) often chooses action 1 or 2. Action 1 from state 0 could lead the agent to move right, down, or left with equal probability. But since moving right is towards the goal, maybe that's a good strategy.

Looking at state 15, which is the goal, it's already a terminal state, so perhaps setting its action doesn't matter, but in the examples, it's set to 2, which might not be necessary. However, in some cases, setting it to another action could prevent potential issues, though I'm not sure.

I think I should try to create a policy that encourages movement towards the right and down, as those directions are generally towards the goal (state 15). For example, states near the top row might benefit from moving down or right. Similarly, states on the left side could move right to progress towards the goal.

Considering the slippery nature, I need to make sure that each action choice increases the probability of eventually reaching the goal without stepping into a hole. Maybe setting certain states to always try to move in a direction that statistically has a higher chance of avoiding holes and moving closer to the goal.

Looking at the most recent parameters provided, some have actions that loop or don't progress towards the goal effectively. To improve this, I should ensure that each state's action choice is optimized for making progress towards state 15 while minimizing the risk of falling into a hole.

I'll try creating a policy where states closer to the goal encourage moving right and down, and states further away do the same but in a way that avoids potential holes. For example, from state 0 (top-left), choosing action 2 might move the agent towards up, which isn't helpful, so perhaps action 1 or 3 would be better.

Wait, I should think about how each action affects movement. Action 0 from any state leads to down, left, or up with equal probability. Similarly, other actions have their own sets of possible movements. So the policy needs to select actions that, on average, push the agent towards the goal.

I think a greedy approach might work here: for each state, choose the action that has the highest chance of moving closer to the goal. Since it's slippery, I need to consider all possible outcomes of an action and their probabilities.

For example, from state 0 (which is (0,0)), taking action 1 would allow movement right, down, or left. Moving right goes towards state 1, which is better than moving left back to itself. So perhaps action 1 is a good choice for state 0.

Similarly, state 7 is at the top-right corner of the second row. From there, moving right might lead to state 15 if possible. But considering the slippery nature, maybe action 3 would be better as it allows movement left, up, or right, which could help in navigating around potential holes.

I should map out each state and determine which action gives the best chance of moving towards the goal without falling into a hole. This might involve some trial and error, but given that I'm supposed to suggest parameters step by step, I'll aim for a policy that prioritizes right and down movements where possible.

Another consideration is that certain states are holes. From the trajectories provided, it seems like state 10 (which is in the third row) might be a hole because one trajectory ends there with a reward of 0. So, avoiding actions that lead to state 10 would be crucial.

In summary, I'll construct the policy by assigning each state an action that statistically increases the chances of moving towards the goal and avoids known holes. This should involve setting most states to move right or down, adjusting based on their position relative to the goal.
