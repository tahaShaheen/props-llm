You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to find the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment using a policy gradient method. The policy is represented by an array of 16 values corresponding to each state in the grid. Each value can be 0, 1, 2, or 3, representing different actions: 'left', 'down', 'right', and 'up'. 

From what I understand, the goal is to maximize the episodic reward by learning a policy that avoids stepping into holes (wholes) on the grid. The agent should exploit promising paths while not getting stuck in the slippery map where it can go four directions equally. 

I need to experiment with different values for params[0] through params[15], which determine the actions taken from each state. My first move is to try a couple of parameters that might balance exploration and exploitation. I remember reading about Q-learning, which uses a discount factor (like gamma) but in this case, we're using a policy gradient method. 

I'll start by trying params[0] = 1 and params[1] = 2. So from the top-left state (0), the agent should take action 'down' with probability 1. Then, from other states where possible actions are taken in certain proportions. I need to consider that sometimes it might be better to stick with known good actions but occasionally explore others.

Let me think about some specific examples. In the first example given, params[0] = 2, which means 'down' is less likely. That seems a bit safer because if there's an issue around the grid (the holes), the agent might have trouble continuing. On the other hand, in another example, params[1] = 3 suggests a higher chance of taking certain actions. I should probably find a middle ground where both exploration and exploitation are balanced.

I also recall that using a value function based on state distributions could help. Maybe if I calculate an expected reward for each action from a given state, the agent can decide which action gives the highest immediate reward plus the potential future rewards. 

Wait, but since this is a policy gradient approach, maybe I should focus more on the gradients of the policy parameters with respect to the returns. This might allow me to adjust the parameters based on how much improving one action would benefit overall performance.

I'm also considering whether higher values like 3 (up, right, or down) are better in certain situations. For example, if moving up could avoid some immediate holes and open up more paths, that might be a positive action. Conversely, taking 'left' when it's risky to step into a hole is important for safety.

I should try varying params[0] from 1 to 3 and see how it affects the policy. Let me pick params[0] = 2 (down) and others as they are in some examples. That might balance between taking down and not getting stuck where there's slippery terrain. 

Alternatively, I could set params[0] = 0 (move left) to explore more, but that seems too conservative since it allows for immediate risks. So perhaps a mix is better.

I think the key is to try parameters where some actions are taken with higher probabilities and others less, while ensuring that no single action becomes overused or underused. I'll start by trying params[0] = 1, params[1] = 2, etc., in both directions and see which combination leads to better performance.

I should also consider the immediate reward from each action and how it affects future steps. For states on holes (like state 15), the reward is zero except when they are reached, which gives +1. So avoiding reaching these states would be crucial for higher rewards.

Overall, I'm going to try several parameter combinations where some actions are taken more frequently than others, ensuring that both exploration and exploitation opportunities are covered without overfocusing on any single action. This way, the policy should navigate the grid effectively while not getting stuck in the slippery patches.
