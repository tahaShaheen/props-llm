You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. So, from what I understand, it's a 4x4 grid where each state is represented by a number from 0 to 15. The goal is to reach state 15, which gives a reward of +1, but there are holes that end the episode if stepped on. 

The environment is slippery, meaning when you take an action, you might not move as intended—each action has a 33% chance of moving in three possible directions. So, my policy needs to account for this uncertainty.

Looking at the previous top-performing policies and their rewards, I notice that most have f(params) around 0.45 or lower. The global optimal should be around 1.0, so we're definitely not there yet. This suggests that our current strategies are either getting stuck in loops or not efficiently navigating towards the goal.

The recent params provided didn't yield any reward, which might mean they led to falling into holes or were ineffective. I need to propose a new set of parameters that explore different paths and avoid these issues.

I think a good approach is to design policies that move the agent towards state 15 while avoiding known holes. Since each action has multiple possible outcomes, we should choose actions that maximize the chances of moving closer to the goal without risking falling into a hole.

For example, from the start (state 0), moving right or down might be better since it can lead towards the goal. But considering the slippery nature, perhaps choosing an action that gives multiple movement options could help in navigating around holes.

I'll try to create a policy where each state directs the agent towards states closer to 15 while having some flexibility due to the slippery effect. Maybe for each state, choose an action that allows the agent to move right or down more often, but with enough variation to avoid getting stuck.

Let me sketch out some possible actions:

- State 0: Try moving right (action 1) which can lead to states 1, 4, or another direction.
- States near the top row might benefit from moving down as it's closer to the goal.
- For middle states, perhaps a combination of right and down actions.

Wait, but I should make sure that each action allows for multiple paths. Maybe setting all policies to choose an action that has a mix of movements that could lead towards the goal without risking immediate falls.

Alternatively, maybe setting all actions to 1 or 2 could help in exploring more directions. But looking at previous top params, many use action 1 and 3, which might suggest a balance between right/down/left.

I think I'll propose a new set where each state's action is chosen to maximize the chance of moving towards the goal while considering possible slippery outcomes. Maybe setting all actions to either 1 or 2, as these allow for right and other movements, which could help in reaching the bottom-right corner.

Wait, but I also need to avoid falling into holes. So perhaps for certain states near the edges, specific actions are better. For example, state 0: moving right (action 1) because it's the start, and action 1 can move down, left, or right—so a mix that might get towards the goal.

I'm not sure if this is optimal, but I'll proceed to suggest a new set of params where each state chooses an action that has a higher probability of moving towards the goal, considering the slippery nature.
