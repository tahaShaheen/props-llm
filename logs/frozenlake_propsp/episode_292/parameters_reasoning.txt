You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me break down what I know and think through how to approach this.

First, the environment is a 4x4 grid with state numbers from 0 to 15. The goal is state 15, which gives a reward of +1, while all others give 0. The slippery nature means that each action has three possible outcomes, each with equal probability (1/3). So when the agent takes an action, it can move in one of three directions randomly.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 parameters, each being 0-3, representing the action taken from each state. The challenge is to find the set of actions that maximizes the average reward over episodes, avoiding holes which end the episode with no reward.

Looking at the provided data, the top-performing policies have rewards around 0.25, which is significantly below the target of 1.0. This suggests that there's room for improvement and better policies haven't been found yet.

In the most recent trials, some parameters are leading to very low or zero rewards. For example, one policy got a reward of 0.00 with a trajectory ending in loops without reaching the goal. Another had 0.05 but still didn't reach state 15. So, I need to propose new policies that might explore more effectively.

Given that we're in iteration 292 and have 5000 total allowed, it's early enough to focus on exploration rather than exploitation since the rewards are far from optimal. My goal is to suggest a parameter set that hasn't been tried before and could potentially reach the goal state.

I'll consider what states might be leading towards the goal. For instance, states closer to 15 should have actions that move right or down, considering the grid's layout. But since actions are probabilistic, each state's policy must account for possible movements without falling into holes.

Looking at the top policies, some have a mix of actions like moving right, up, and others. To explore further, perhaps setting certain states to always move towards the goal direction could help. For example, in state 0 (top-left corner), action 1 is right, which moves to state 3 or maybe another nearby state.

Wait, let me think about each state's possible transitions. From state 0 (0,0), moving right goes to state 1, down to state 4, and up would stay in the same row but can't go beyond the grid, so it might wrap or not move. But considering the slippery nature, from state 0, action 0 is [down, left, up], which would have left leading to invalid state, perhaps staying put? Or maybe it's undefined, and the agent remains in the same state.

Hmm, I need to clarify how the grid handles edges. If an action leads outside the grid (like moving up from row 0 or down from row 3), does the agent stay in place or is that considered a hole? The problem statement doesn't specify, so perhaps it's safe to assume that such moves are invalid and might result in staying put or not progressing.

Given this uncertainty, I should choose actions that have a higher chance of moving towards the goal without getting stuck. For example, in state 0, choosing action 1 (right) would try to move right, which is valid, so it increases the chance of reaching the goal path.

Similarly, for other states like 7 (top-right), moving down might be better as that's closer to the goal. From state 4 (row 2, column 0), action down leads to row 3, column 0, which is state 12, and so on.

I should also consider avoiding holes by ensuring that actions from certain states don't lead into known holes. For example, if a hole exists at state 5, then the policy for nearby states should avoid actions that would land there with high probability.

But without knowing where exactly the holes are, I need to make general assumptions. The key is to set each state's action such that it maximizes the chance of moving towards the goal while minimizing the risk of falling into a hole.

Looking at previous policies, many had varying actions, but none reached the optimal reward. Perhaps a more deterministic approach in some states could help, like always choosing right or down from certain positions.

I think setting up a policy where each state directs the agent either right or down based on their grid position might be effective. For example:

- From even-numbered columns (like 0,2) in row 0, move right.
- From odd-numbered columns in row 0, move down to start moving towards the bottom.

But considering the slippery nature, this deterministic approach isn't possible since each action has three possible outcomes. So instead, I need to select actions that have a higher probability of contributing to reaching the goal.

Alternatively, focusing on states near the goal might be more effective. For instance, setting state 14 (third row, third column) to move right or down, as moving right from there would reach state 15.

Wait, let me map out the grid again:

- Row 0: 0 (0,0), 1 (0,1), 2 (0,2), 3 (0,3)
- Row 1: 4 (1,0), 5 (1,1), 6 (1,2), 7 (1,3)
- Row 2: 8 (2,0), 9 (2,1), 10 (2,2), 11 (2,3)
- Row 3: 12 (3,0), 13 (3,1), 14 (3,2), 15 (3,3)

From state 14, the goal is to move right to reach 15. So action 3 from state 14 would have possible moves left, up, or right. Right leads to goal, others might loop or go back.

So setting params[14] = 3 (action right) could help in reaching the goal when the agent is there. Similarly, for other states near the goal, choosing actions that increase the chance of moving towards it.

But since each action has three possible moves, I need to ensure that from each state, at least one of the possible moves leads closer to the goal without falling into a hole.

Perhaps a greedy approach where each state's action is chosen to maximize the expected progress towards the goal. For example:

- From state 0: choose right (action 1) to move towards state 3.
- From state 4: choose down (action 0) to move towards state 8, but wait, that might not be optimal as it's moving away from the goal.

Alternatively, maybe from states in row 0 and columns less than 3, choosing right action; from row 0 column 3, choosing down. From other rows, choose down or right based on proximity to the goal.

But without knowing the exact hole positions, this is tricky. However, given that all previous policies have low rewards, perhaps I should try a policy where more states are set to move towards the bottom-right direction.

I'll propose a new set of parameters where each state's action is chosen to generally move down or right, depending on their position. For example:

- In row 0: choose right actions except for column 3.
- In row 1: choose down actions more often.
- Similarly, in rows 2 and 3, choose right towards the goal.

But since each action has three possible moves, I need to select the action that has a higher chance of moving towards the goal. For instance, from state i, choose an action that includes a movement towards the goal in at least one of its possible directions.

Alternatively, perhaps choosing actions that allow for more exploration, like varied movements, could help discover new paths or avoid holes.

Given all this, I think a reasonable approach is to set each state's action such that it has a higher probability of moving towards the goal. For example:

- From even-numbered states in even rows, choose right.
- From odd-numbered states in even rows, choose down.
- Similarly for other rows.

But without precise mapping, perhaps I should look at previous top policies and see if there's a pattern to build upon. The first top policy had params[0]=2 (action 2), which is up, left, or down. Maybe that wasn't the best choice as it didn't reach the goal.

Alternatively, setting action 1 for state 0 might be better as it includes right, down, and left, but right leads towards the goal.

Wait, perhaps I should make a table of each state's optimal action based on their position relative to the goal. For example:

- States in row 3 (states 12-15) should have actions that move right or stay if at 15.
- States in columns closer to 3 should prioritize moving right.

But considering the slippery nature, each action's outcome is random among three directions, so it's challenging. Maybe setting all states near the goal to action 3 (right, up, left) could help as one of the outcomes leads directly to the goal.

Alternatively, for state 14 (3,2), choosing action 3 would allow a chance to move right to state 15, which is good. Similarly, for state 10 (2,2), choosing action 3 would let it try moving right or down.

In summary, I think the optimal policy should have actions that from each state, at least one of the possible moves leads closer to the goal without falling into a hole. Therefore, I'll propose a new set of parameters where each state's action is chosen based on its position relative to the goal, aiming to increase the probability of reaching state 15.
