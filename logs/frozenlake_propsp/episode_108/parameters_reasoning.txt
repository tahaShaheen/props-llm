You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's try to figure this out step by step. So, I'm trying to help find the optimal policy for a FrozenLake environment that's 4x4. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) which gives a reward of +1. All other states give 0, and there are holes that end the episode if stepped on.

First, I need to understand how the environment works. It's slippery, so each action has three possible outcomes with equal probability. That means when an agent takes an action, it doesn't always go where it intends—it might move in one of two other directions randomly. This makes planning a bit tricky because the agent can't be certain where it will end up.

The policy is defined by an array called params, where each element corresponds to a state (0-15) and determines which action to take from that state. The possible actions are 0, 1, 2, or 3. The challenge is to set these values so that the agent maximizes its chance of reaching state 15 without falling into any holes.

Looking at the examples provided, I see that previous policies have yielded low rewards (around 0.10), which suggests that none of them are very effective yet. This indicates that we're in an exploration phase since the rewards aren't close to the theoretical maximum of 1.0.

Given that it's slippery and actions can lead to unintended movements, a good strategy might be to have the agent move towards the goal while minimizing the risk of falling into holes. For example, moving right or down generally brings the agent closer to state 15, but we need to ensure that these moves don't lead into known holes.

Since the environment is 4x4, I can map out each state and figure out which actions would be safest. For instance:

- In state 0 (top-left corner), moving right or down should help move towards the goal.
- In state 15 (bottom-right), the agent has already reached the goal, so any action is moot.

I also notice that in previous attempts, agents often get stuck in loops or fall into holes because their policies aren't accounting for the slippery nature. So, I need to design a policy where each state's action choice leads towards the goal while considering possible slips.

Let me sketch out some potential actions:

- States closer to the bottom-right (like 12, 13, 14, 15) should have actions that move right or down if possible.
- For states near the edges, actions should avoid moving into known hole positions.

But without knowing exactly where the holes are, it's challenging. However, from the trajectories provided, I can infer some patterns. For example, certain states might lead to holes frequently, so avoiding actions that go towards those directions could be beneficial.

I think a good approach is to have each state choose an action that generally moves toward the goal while being cautious about possible slips. Since each action has three possible outcomes, the policy should account for all possibilities and try to maximize the chance of reaching the goal without falling into holes.

Given that previous policies aren't performing well, I'll propose a new set of params that tries different actions in key states to see how they perform. For example:

- In state 0 (top-left), maybe trying action 1 (which can move right, down, or left) might help explore more directions.
- In state 1, perhaps action 3 could lead towards the goal without immediate risk.

I'll aim to create a policy where each state's action choice is varied enough to avoid getting stuck but also directional enough to head towards the goal. Since all previous policies have low rewards, it's essential to try new configurations that might open up better paths.

So, putting this together, I'll propose a params array that assigns actions in a way that generally moves towards the goal but varies enough to explore different paths and avoid holes.
