You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to help the user find the optimal policy in the FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15, which is the bottom right corner, and get a reward of +1 there. All other states give a reward of 0.

The user mentioned that it's an slippery environment, meaning when the agent takes an action, it has equal probability to go in three directions instead of two. So each action leads to one of three possible next states with equal chance. 

The policy is represented by a function mapping state indices (from 0 to 15) to actions (0-3). The current parameters (params array) are set to [0, 0, 0, 0], and the user wants these params values to be chosen from [0,1,2,3]. 

The reward function f(params) is computed over iterations. The goal is to maximize this reward, aiming for the highest possible value. 

Looking at the examples provided, some policies yield a reward of 1.00, which seems good, but others have lower rewards. The best policy gives around 0.25 or higher in some cases.

I remember that this is a reinforcement learning problem where we need to find the optimal policy through trial and error, possibly using techniques like Q-learning or policy gradient methods. Since the user wants exploration via trajectories and picking actions not leading to holes, I should ensure that the agent explores various paths without getting stuck on any "holes" in the grid.

Given that each action leads to 3 possible next states with equal probability, the agent's behavior will have some uncertainty. To avoid getting stuck, it needs a strategy that allows it to revisit previously visited states but also explore new ones based on the current policy.

Now, considering the parameters array of size 16, each param represents an action from 0 to 14 when in state 0 to 15 respectively. The optimal params might be a combination of these that encourage exploring different paths without getting stuck into holes.

From the examples provided, it seems that policies where some actions (like action 2) lead deeper into the grid can yield higher rewards. Maybe using parameters like [0:2, 1:3, 2:1] or similar combinations could be effective. I should test different parameter sets to see which ones maximize the reward.

I might need to run a few iterations manually with different params values, evaluating each one's f(params) as the user provides the current iteration number. If I can find that higher reward comes from certain action patterns in some states, I can then adjust the parameters accordingly. But since I don't have actual execution here, I'll rely on my understanding of how these policies perform.

In summary, to maximize the reward, the agent should balance exploration (trying different actions) and exploitation (focusing on good paths), using parameter values from 0-3 for each action in their respective states. The optimal params likely encourage a mix of right, down, and up moves across various grids.
