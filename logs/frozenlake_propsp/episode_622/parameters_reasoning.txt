You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get the agent from any starting position to state 15 (the bottom-right corner) while avoiding holes. Since it's a 4x4 grid, there are 16 possible states, each represented by params[0] to params[15].

First, I need to understand how the slippery environment affects movement. Each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability. So, for example, if the agent takes action 0 (left), it can move down, left, or up, each with a 1/3 chance. This makes planning tricky because the agent's path isn't deterministic.

The policy is a mapping from each state to an action. The optimal policy should maximize the probability of reaching state 15 while minimizing the chances of falling into any holes.

Looking at the provided data, the best performing policies so far have rewards around 0.30, which is below the target of 1.0. This suggests that the current strategies aren't effective enough, and we need to explore more.

The recent attempts include various params configurations, some leading to trajectories that either fall into holes or don't reach the goal quickly. For instance, one policy took action 2 from state 0, which could move up, right, or down. However, since state 0 is at the top-left corner, moving up isn't possible, so it would have a higher chance of going left or down.

I think a good strategy might involve ensuring that in each state, the chosen action has a high probability of moving towards the goal. For example, from state 0 (top-left), moving right or down should be prioritized to head towards state 15. But due to the slippery nature, I need to choose actions that statistically increase the chances of getting closer.

Looking at the grid:

- States 0-3: top row
- States 4-7: second row
- States 8-11: third row
- States 12-15: bottom row

The goal is state 15. So, moving right or down from states in the top and left columns should help.

I'll consider setting each params[i] to an action that generally moves towards the goal, considering possible slips. For example:

- From state 0 (top-left), actions could be right (action 3) which can move left, up, or right. But since moving up isn't possible, right and left are options. Alternatively, down (action 0) might lead to states that get closer.

Wait, actually, action 0 from state 0 would try to move down, but since it's already on the top row, it can only go left or down. Similarly, action 3 from state 0 would try to move right, which is possible, along with other directions.

I think a better approach might be to have each policy in states 0-3 (top row) encourage moving right or down, and for states in the bottom-right areas, ensure they take actions that can lead directly to state 15.

But given the slippery nature, it's hard to predict exact paths. So perhaps setting all policies to action 2 might help because it allows a mix of up, right, and down movements, which could statistically cover more ground towards the goal.

Alternatively, maybe there are specific holes that need to be avoided, so I should look at trajectories where agents fell into holes and adjust their actions accordingly. For example, if from state X, taking action Y leads to a hole, then params[X] should avoid Y.

But without knowing the exact locations of the holes, it's challenging. However, based on the recent attempts, some trajectories led to getting stuck or not reaching the goal quickly. So perhaps I need to vary the actions more to explore different paths and gather more data on which actions are safe.

Since we're at iteration 622, and rewards are still low, I should act as an explorer. This means proposing a new params configuration that hasn't been tried before, focusing on gathering information rather than exploiting current good policies.

Looking at the recent params, many have used action 2 across all states. Maybe trying a different pattern, like alternating actions or grouping similar directions for each row or column, could provide new insights.

For example, setting all states in even columns to move right and odd columns to move down might help spread out the exploration. Or perhaps assigning specific actions based on proximity to the goal.

Another approach is to set each state's action to point towards a direction that statistically has the highest chance of moving closer to the goal, considering possible slips.

Given all this, I think setting params to a mix of right and down actions across different states, avoiding repetition from previous attempts, might be beneficial. So, I'll propose a new configuration where each state's action is chosen to encourage movement towards the bottom-right while varying enough to explore new trajectories.
