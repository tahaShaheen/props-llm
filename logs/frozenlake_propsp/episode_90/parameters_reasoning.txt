You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Alright, I need to figure out the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment using the given parameters. Let's break it down.

First, the state is a 4x4 grid with states numbered from 0 to 15. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right corner). The agent can move in four directions: left, up, down, or right. However, when taking an action, there's a 70% chance the agent will move in a random direction each time due to the slippery environment.

The policy is defined by four parameters, each corresponding to one of the four states (0 to 3). These parameters determine which actions are taken from those states. The values for these parameters are chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3], representing different directions: action 0 is left, action 1 is right, action 2 is up, and action 3 is down.

The goal is to maximize the episodic reward, which is +1 when reaching state 15 and 0 otherwise. The agent should explore through previously seen trajectories by avoiding holes in the map. Holes are states that end the game if stepped upon, so the agent needs to find these holes efficiently.

Looking at the provided top-performing parameters (f(params) = 1.00), one of them is params[2] = 3, which corresponds to moving up from state 2. Other parameters have specific values that determine the action taken based on their state index. For example, when in state 4 (which is column 1, row 2), params[1] is 0, so the agent moves left. Similarly, in state 7 (column 2, row 2), params[3] is 0, meaning the action is left.

The most recent parameters mentioned have f(params) = 0.05, which suggests a lower reward, possibly because the agent didn't explore effectively enough to find the hole. The best reward so far is 1.00 at f(params) = 1.00, indicating that when certain parameters are set, the agent successfully reaches state 15.

Considering all these factors, I think the optimal policy likely prioritizes exploration in areas where holes might be located and exploiting states closer to the goal. Therefore, setting params[2] = 3 (up) from state 2 seems important for escaping any immediate obstacles. Other parameters should guide actions based on their current state, aiming to reach the goal efficiently.
