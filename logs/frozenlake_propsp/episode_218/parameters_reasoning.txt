You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to find the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment using a Q-learning approach with function approximation. 

First, I need to understand the environment setup. It's a 4x4 grid where each cell can be in state 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). The agent starts at state 0 and can move up, down, left, or right. The slippery policy means that when the agent takes an action, it has equal probability of choosing one of three possible actions.

The reward structure is such that reaching state 15 (the goal) yields +1, all other states give a reward of 0. If the agent steps onto a hole, the game ends, and we have to explore by revisiting trajectories.

Now, the policy parameters are an array of 16 values, each representing the action for a state from 0 to 15. The value of each parameter is chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3]. The Q-value function f(params) represents the episodic reward obtained by following this policy.

The challenge is that the global optimal reward might be negative, so we need to explore beyond local optima. Since all states have rewards as 0 except state 15, which gives +1, the total reward per episode will depend on how many times the agent can successfully reach the goal before falling into a hole.

To find the best policy parameters, I'll simulate each possible combination of actions for each state. There are 4^16 = 4,294,967,296 possible parameter combinations. That's way too large to enumerate directly, so I need an efficient approach.

I recall that function approximation with neural networks can generalize across states and actions, allowing us to approximate the Q-value function without storing values for each state-action pair. This would reduce computational complexity and make it feasible to test a wide range of parameters.

Next, I'll outline the steps to implement this:

1. **Model the Problem:** Represent the environment using a grid, where each cell has a specific action probability distribution based on the current policy parameters.

2. **Initialize Parameters:** Set up an initial network (function approximator) with parameters drawn from [0, 1, 2, 3]. Each parameter will be adjusted during training to maximize expected reward.

3. **Policy Execution:** For each state, the agent's action is sampled based on the current policy probabilities. This ensures that actions are chosen according to the latest policy learned so far.

4. **State Exploration:** After taking an action, check if the new state has been visited before. If it hasn't, simulate exploring by revisiting previously seen states with the same action to gather more data.

5. **Reward Calculation:** For each exploration, collect rewards and update the Q-value estimates using a suitable method like the Monte Carlo approach or Q-learning with function approximation.

6. **Parameter Update:** After each simulation (explore+explore), adjust the policy parameters based on the updated Q-values to minimize prediction errors.

7. **Convergence Check:** Monitor the average reward across episodes and continue training until convergence, meaning the reward stabilizes or reaches a satisfactory level.

Finally, after sufficient training iterations (400 in this case), the policy's parameters will approximate the optimal one, which is likely the ones given as an example with f(params) around 1.00. Testing different parameter combinations and tracking their average rewards will help determine if we've found the global optimum.
