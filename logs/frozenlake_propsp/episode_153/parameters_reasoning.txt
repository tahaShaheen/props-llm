You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

Do NOT output anything else. No explanation, no reasoning, nothing.



LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to propose the next set of parameters for the FrozenLake environment based on the given information. The goal is to find a policy that maximizes the reward by reaching state 15 (the bottom-right corner) while avoiding holes.

First, let me understand the setup:

- The grid is 4x4 with states numbered from 0 to 15.
- The slippery nature means each action leads to one of three possible directions with equal probability.
- Holes exist, but their locations aren't explicitly given. I need to infer them based on previous trajectories.

Looking at the top 8 best-performing parameters, all have a reward around 0.15. That's much lower than the target of 1.0, which suggests that the current policies are not effective in reaching the goal consistently. This implies that I'm in the "Explorer" phase since the rewards are far below optimal.

I notice that in previous attempts, many parameters have a similar structure where even-numbered states (like 0,2,4,...) take action 1 or 3, and odd-numbered states take action 3 or 1. This pattern might not be effective because it's too conservative, perhaps leading the agent into loops or holes.

To maximize information gain, I should propose a parameter set that is significantly different from previous ones. Maybe vary the actions more to explore new paths. For example, changing some even states to action 2 and others to action 0 could help avoid holes and reach the goal.

Looking at the recent parameters, they have varying actions but with lower rewards. I should try a configuration where each state chooses an action that has a higher chance of moving towards the goal (state 15). For instance, in the top-left corner (state 0), choosing right or down might help move closer to the goal.

Let me sketch out a possible parameter set:

- Even states: Alternate between actions that push towards the right and down.
- Odd states: Use actions that can navigate around potential holes.

But without knowing the hole locations, I have to rely on trajectories. For example, state 0 in some previous policies took action 1 (which moves left, down, or up). Maybe switching it to action 3 (right, up, or down) could lead towards the goal more directly.

I'll try setting even-numbered states to either 2 or 3 and odd-numbered states to 0 or 1. This variation might help in breaking out of loops and exploring new paths.

After considering all this, I propose a parameter set where each state has a mix of actions aimed at progressing towards the goal while avoiding repetition.
