You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment using the given parameters. Let me break down the problem and think through each step carefully.

First, the environment is a 4x4 grid where the agent can move in four directions: left, right, up, or down. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner), which gives a reward of +1. All other states give a reward of 0. There are some holes on the map that make it harder because once you step onto one, you might fall into a hole and lose all the future rewards.

The policy is represented by an array 'params' with four values (since the grid is 4x4), each corresponding to actions 0,1,2,3. Each value should be chosen from [0,1,2,3].

The key points are:
- The environment is slippery: when taking a specific action, it has equal probability among three directions.
- The goal reward is +1 for state 15, but other states have 0 rewards.
- Holes are present on the map, so once you step onto one, it's hard to explore further without risking getting into a hole.

I should consider that the optimal policy will avoid stepping on holes and exploit the best actions in other states. Since some states can lead to holes, the agent needs to explore them unless exploiting an action always leads to higher rewards.

Given the recent examples provided, there are some patterns:
- States with more reward-reward (RR) paths tend to be better because they have higher rewards leading towards the goal.
- There's also some uncertainty in certain states due to the slippery nature of actions.

Since I don't see any holes on the map (as the user didn't mention any), maybe I can focus on optimizing without worrying about falling into them. But perhaps there are holes that prevent easy exploration.

Wait, but looking at the provided examples, some params result in lower rewards like 0.20 or even 0.15, so it's clear the optimal policy needs to be found.

Given that, I should try different combinations of actions (from [0,1,2,3]) for each state, taking into account the slippery nature and trying to maximize immediate rewards while considering future states.

I need to set up a function or method to evaluate each possible 'params' array. For each parameter value, I can simulate the agent's policy, executing it, and calculating the total reward from that run. Then, choosing the 'params' with the highest reward would be optimal.

Since this is part of an interactive process where I don't have a predefined plan, perhaps using reinforcement learning methods like Q-learning or SARSA could help. However, since I'm just providing values for params[0], params[1], etc., without implementing an algorithm, maybe it's best to reason through the best action choices in each state.

Looking at the examples:
- States that are mostly RR paths might prefer actions 3 (left), because it leads towards higher rewards.
- States with equal rewards between R and D could choose any of R, D, or L, but L is preferred for safety due to slipping probabilities.

However, without a clear structure, I have to make educated guesses. Let me think about typical optimal paths in the FrozenLake environment:

The standard optimal policy for 4x4 grid involves:
- In state (0,0) (state 0): prefer moving down to avoid getting stuck.
- In state (0,1), move right or left, depending on other factors.
- In state (3,3) which is the goal, take action 3.

Considering the slippery nature and potential holes (even though none are mentioned here), perhaps it's best to avoid actions that lead to more risk, especially in states where slipping could lead into a hole. So I might lean towards taking action 2 (up), but only if all other options don't result in falling into a hole.

But without knowing the exact map layout and which cells are holes, it's hard. However, since no holes are mentioned here, perhaps focusing on typical paths is better.

So, considering each state:
- For states that can reach the goal quickly, take action 3 (left or down).
- For others, take actions towards higher immediate rewards, possibly preferring left and right to avoid falling into holes if possible.

Therefore, I might set params[0] = 2, params[1] = 3, params[2] = 1, etc., trying different combinations where the agent explores without getting stuck in holes.
