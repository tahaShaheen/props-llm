You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help optimize the policy for this FrozenLake environment. From what I understand, it's a 4x4 grid where each state is represented by a number from 0 to 15. The agent can move in four directions: left, down, right, up. But because of the slippery nature, when an action is taken, there's a probability of moving to one of three other states with equal chance.

The goal is to reach state 15 (bottom-right corner) for a reward of +1, while avoiding holes which end the episode immediately. The policy is defined by an array of 16 actions, each corresponding to a state from 0 to 15.

Looking at the examples provided, most policies have low rewards around 0.10-0.15, and one even got 0.05. Since the optimal reward should be around 1.0, we're definitely not there yet. So I need to figure out how to structure a policy that can consistently reach state 15 without falling into holes.

First, I notice that in the top-performing params, many are choosing actions that move towards the right or down, but due to the slipperiness, they might be getting stuck or going off track. For example, in the first top param, all even-numbered states have action 1 (right?), and odd-numbered ones have 3 (up?).

But since the environment is slippery, just choosing a direction isn't enough; the policy needs to account for possible drifts. Maybe we should structure the policy so that regardless of the slip, it still progresses towards the goal.

Looking at the grid:

- State 0 is top-left.
- Moving down from state 0 would take you to state 4 (second row first column).
- The goal is state 15, which is the bottom-right.

So a logical path would be moving right when possible or down. But since actions are probabilistic, each action has three possibilities.

I think a good strategy might be to have states on the top row (0-3) choose an action that mostly moves towards the right and/or down. Similarly, for the leftmost column (states 0,4,8,12), moving down would be logical since it's closer to the goal.

Wait, but the examples showed that some policies are getting stuck in loops or not making progress. So perhaps we need a more structured approach where each state is mapped to an action that, despite the slipperiness, has a higher chance of moving towards the goal over time.

Maybe using a greedy approach where states closer to the goal have specific actions. For example, states near 15 (like 12,13,14) should prioritize right or down movements. But how can we encode that in the policy?

Looking at one of the top params:

params[0]:1; ... ; f(params):0.15

Assuming action 1 is right, this might be a good start for state 0 (top-left). From there, moving right could lead towards state 3 or perhaps down to 4.

But considering the slipperiness, we need each action to have multiple possible moves that don't immediately fall into holes. So maybe states near edges should choose actions that mostly move towards the goal but also have alternatives.

Alternatively, perhaps a deterministic policy isn't the way to go because of the slip. Instead, we might want each state's action to have a higher chance of moving in the desired direction but with enough variety to avoid traps.

Wait, looking at another example:

params[0]:2; ... ; f(params):0.15

Action 2 is up? So from state 0 (top-left), moving up isn't possible because you're already on the top row. But since it's slippery, choosing up would send you either left or right with some probability.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Since each action leads to three possible moves, perhaps we need a policy that for each state, chooses an action whose possible moves include states closer to the goal without leading into holes.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal policy should always move towards the goal direction, regardless of the slip. For instance, in state 0 (top-left), choosing right would take you towards state 3 or down to 4, which are steps closer to the goal.

Wait, but when action is taken, say right from state 0, it could go to state 1 (right), state 4 (down), or state something else. So maybe for each state, choose an action that maximizes the chance of moving towards the goal in one of the three possible moves.

For example:

- For state 0: choosing right (action 1) would have a chance to move to states 1, 4, or perhaps others, but overall progressing down or right.
- Similarly, for other states, choose actions that push you closer to 15.

But without knowing the exact hole positions, it's tricky. Maybe the holes are in certain states, so we need policies that avoid them.

Looking at the trajectories provided:

One trajectory went from (0,3) to (1,0), which might be a hole. So perhaps state 1 is a hole? Or maybe some other state.

Wait, I don't have information on where the holes are. That complicates things because the agent needs to learn to avoid them based on previous trajectories.

Given that all policies so far aren't performing well, it's likely that they're not effectively avoiding holes or navigating towards the goal efficiently.

So perhaps a better approach is to create a policy that explores more in early states and then converges. But as an optimizer without memory, I have to choose each time based on maximizing information gain.

Since current rewards are low, I should act as an explorer, suggesting a new policy configuration that hasn't been tried before. Looking at the previous params, most have patterns like alternating 1s and 3s or similar repetitions.

Maybe introducing more diversity in actions could help. For example, having some states take different actions to see if they can reach the goal without falling into holes.

Alternatively, focusing on states that are closer to the goal and ensuring their policies lead directly there. Maybe for states 12-15, set actions that move right or down as much as possible.

But without knowing which states are holes, it's hard to ensure avoidance. So perhaps a more robust policy would have each state take an action that has a high probability of moving towards the goal in at least one direction, while not leading directly into a hole.

In summary, I think I should propose a policy where each state is mapped to an action that generally moves towards the right or down, considering the grid layout. Since the agent can't remember past attempts, this iteration will be based on choosing such actions to maximize the chance of reaching the goal.
