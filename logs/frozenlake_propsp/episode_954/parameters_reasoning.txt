You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get the agent from the starting position (state 0) to state 15 with the highest possible reward, avoiding the holes along the way.

First, I need to understand how the environment works. It's a 4x4 grid where each cell represents a state numbered from 0 to 15. The agent can move in four directions—left, down, right, up—but because it's slippery, when the agent takes an action, there's a 33% chance of moving in one of three possible directions instead of the intended one.

The policy is defined by an array called params with 16 elements (since there are 16 states). Each element in params corresponds to the action taken when the agent is in that state. The actions are 0, 1, 2, or 3.

From the problem statement, I know that the optimal reward should be around 1.0, meaning the agent successfully reaches state 15 in most episodes. So far, the best performing policies have an average reward of about 0.45, which is not great. That suggests there's room for improvement.

Looking at the trajectories provided, it seems like the agent often gets stuck or falls into holes because the current policies aren't directing it effectively towards the goal while avoiding hazards.

I need to think about how to design a policy that navigates the agent towards state 15 without stepping on any holes. Since the environment is slippery, the agent's path isn't straightforward. So, the policy must account for the probabilistic movement and choose actions that statistically increase the chances of reaching the goal safely.

Let me consider each state and determine which action would be most beneficial. For example, in state 0 (top-left corner), moving right or down might be better depending on where the holes are. Similarly, in other states, the agent should aim to move towards the goal while avoiding known holes.

Since I can't remember previous attempts, each suggestion must be based solely on the information provided up to this point. The latest parameters suggest that some policies have trajectories leading towards state 15 but getting stuck or falling into holes before reaching.

To improve, maybe I should adjust the actions for certain states to avoid high-risk paths and increase the likelihood of moving closer to the goal. For instance, in states where moving a particular direction leads to a hole, the policy should choose an alternative action that avoids that path.

I'll go through each state one by one and decide the optimal action based on what's needed to move towards state 15 while avoiding holes.

State 0 (top-left corner):
- The agent is at (0,0). To get closer to the goal, it should probably move right or down. But since moving right leads to state 1 and moving down leads to state 4, I need to see which path has fewer holes. If moving right is risky, then choosing down might be safer.

State 1:
- Being in state 1 (0,1), the agent can move left, down, or right. Moving down would take it to state 5, but if that's a hole, maybe moving right to state 2 is better.

Continuing this line of reasoning for each state, I need to map out the best possible actions that navigate towards state 15 while avoiding known holes.

After considering all states and their positions relative to the goal and potential hazards, I'll propose a new set of params that directs the agent more effectively towards the goal. This should involve changing some of the previous parameters to avoid dangerous moves and increase the chances of reaching state 15.
