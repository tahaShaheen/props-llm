You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get from any starting point to state 15 (the bottom right corner) without falling into a hole. The agent's actions are slippery, meaning each action has three possible outcomes with equal probability.

First, I need to understand how the states and actions work. There are 16 states in total, numbered 0 to 15. Each state corresponds to a grid cell. The movement is such that when an action is taken (like moving right), there's a 33% chance of going left, down, or up as well, depending on the action chosen.

Looking at the problem, I see that the policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers, each indicating the action to take in that state. The challenge is to find the optimal set of actions that maximize the reward, which is +1 upon reaching state 15 and 0 otherwise.

The user has provided some top-performing policies along with their rewards and trajectories. The highest reward so far is around 0.45, but ideally, we want a policy that gets close to 1.0. This suggests that the current policies are not yet optimal, as they're not reliably reaching the goal.

I notice that many of the top policies have similar structures, with certain states choosing specific actions. For example, state 0 is often set to action 1 or 2. I need to determine which actions in each state lead towards state 15 while avoiding holes.

Since the environment is slippery, the agent can't rely on a single path; it must plan for multiple possible outcomes. Therefore, the policy should guide the agent towards increasing its chances of reaching the goal without stepping into a hole.

Looking at the recent policies and their trajectories, I see that some end up in loops or don't make progress towards the goal. To improve this, I might need to adjust certain states' actions to push the agent more directly towards state 15.

I should consider which actions from each state lead closer to the target. For instance, being in state 0 (top-left corner), moving right (action 1) would take it to state 1 or other adjacent states, but considering the slipperiness, perhaps choosing an action that generally moves towards the right or down is better.

I also need to identify which states are holes and avoid them. From the trajectories provided, I can infer some hole positions based on where the agent falls into. For example, state 6 seems like a hole because in one trajectory, the agent steps there and ends the episode.

To create an optimal policy, each state should choose actions that either move directly towards the goal or avoid known holes. Since it's impossible to know all the holes without more information, I have to make educated guesses based on the trajectories provided.

I'll start by mapping out possible movements from each state and see which actions are most likely to lead towards state 15 while avoiding failure states. For example:

- State 0: moving right or down could be beneficial.
- State 1: moving right, down, or up might help depending on the position of holes.
- And so on for other states.

I'll also consider that in slippery conditions, taking an action that has a higher probability of moving towards the goal while having alternative safe moves is crucial. This means avoiding actions that could lead to holes even with some probability.

Given all this, I'll propose a new set of parameters where each state's action is chosen to maximize the chance of reaching the goal, considering the slipperiness and known (or inferred) hole positions.
