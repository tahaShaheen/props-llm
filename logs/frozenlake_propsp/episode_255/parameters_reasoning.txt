You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to help find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. It's a 4x4 grid where the agent moves around with some slippery actions, and there are holes that can end the episode if stepped on. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) for a reward of +1.

First, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. The environment is a bit tricky because when the agent takes an action, it doesn't always move in the intended direction due to the slippery nature. Each action has three possible outcomes with equal probability. This means that even if the agent chooses to go right, there's a chance it might end up moving down or left instead.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 integers (params[0] to params[15]), each corresponding to the action taken when in that state. The actions are 0: [down, left, up], 1: [right, down, left], 2: [up, right, down], and 3: [left, up, right]. Each of these can be chosen by setting the respective value in the params array.

The goal is to maximize the episodic reward, which should ideally be around 1.0 if the agent successfully reaches state 15 without falling into a hole. However, from the provided data, it seems that none of the policies so far have achieved this optimal reward. The highest reported was 0.25, and most are below that.

Looking at the trajectories provided, I can see that some policies get stuck in loops or end up in holes quickly. For example, a policy might keep moving left from state 0 (params[0]=1), which could lead it into a hole if not careful. The challenge is to design a policy that navigates towards state 15 while avoiding the holes.

Since I'm supposed to act as a stateless optimizer, I can't remember previous attempts, so each suggestion must be based solely on the information provided in the buffer. My role alternates between Explorer and Optimizer depending on the current reward performance. Since the rewards are far below 1.0, I should focus on exploration rather than exploitation.

Given that, I need to propose a new set of params that hasn't been tried before (to avoid repetition) and that might provide more information about the environment's structure. The key is to select actions for each state that either move directly towards the goal or increase the chances of reaching it while minimizing the risk of falling into holes.

I should also consider the slippery nature of moves. For instance, if the agent is in a state where moving right is intended but might end up elsewhere, I need to choose an action that, despite the slipperiness, has the highest probability of leading towards the goal or avoiding holes.

Looking at the grid layout, state 15 is the bottom-right corner. The surrounding states (12, 13, 14) are in the same row and column as 15. So, for these states, the optimal action would be to move right or down (if applicable) to reach 15.

For example:
- In state 12 (which is 12,0), moving right should lead towards 13, but considering slipperiness, it's better to choose an action that maximizes the chance of moving right. Action 1 (right, down, left) might be suitable since there's a chance to move right.

Similarly, in state 14 (which is 2,3), moving right would lead directly to 15. So choosing an action that has a high probability of moving right (action 1 or 3) could be beneficial.

I also need to ensure that actions taken from states near the holes don't accidentally step into them. For example, state 4 is in the second row, first column. If there's a hole there, the policy must avoid any action that might lead into it.

Considering all this, I'll draft a new set of params where each state chooses an action that either directly aims for the goal or avoids dangerous areas. Since I can't remember previous attempts, I'll pick actions that seem logical based on their positions and the slippery probabilities.

Here's how I'll approach each state:
- For states in the top row (0-3), moving down towards lower-numbered states might help avoid holes.
- For middle states, choosing actions that move right or down to head towards 15.
- Ensuring that from any state, the chosen action doesn't have a high probability of leading into known holes.

After considering all this, I'll propose a new set of params where each state is mapped to an action that either moves towards the goal or avoids risky moves. The exact values will be chosen based on maximizing the chance of reaching 15 while minimizing the risk.
