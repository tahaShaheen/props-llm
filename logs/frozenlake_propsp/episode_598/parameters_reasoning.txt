You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to help find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get a reward of 1 by reaching state 15 without falling into any holes. Since it's slippery, actions can take you in different directions with equal probability.

First, I need to understand the current best policies and their rewards. From the provided data, the top-performing params have an average reward of around 0.30, which is significantly below the target of 1.0. This suggests that we're not yet exploiting optimally but are in the exploration phase.

Looking at the recent params, they seem to be trying various actions but aren't consistently moving towards the goal. For example, some policies get stuck or take trajectories that don't lead them anywhere useful. I should focus on creating a policy that directs the agent towards state 15 without stepping into holes.

Since the environment is slippery, it's crucial for each state to have an action that maximizes the chance of moving towards the goal while avoiding dangerous states. For instance, being in state 0 (top-left), moving right or down could be safer. But due to the slipperiness, we need to choose actions that statistically lead closer to the goal.

I should analyze each state's possible moves and determine which action would best avoid holes and increase the likelihood of reaching the end. For example, state 14 is near the goal; perhaps moving up or right might be better there. Similarly, states near the edges need careful handling to prevent falling into holes.

Given that previous attempts have low rewards, I should consider exploring new policies by varying actions in key positions without repeating past configs. Maybe changing some of the recent params to different actions could lead to a higher reward path.

So, I'll craft a new set of params where each state's action is chosen to either move towards the goal or avoid holes based on the environment's structure, ensuring that we don't repeat any previous configurations and maximize information gain for future iterations.
