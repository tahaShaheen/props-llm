You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me start by understanding the problem thoroughly.

The environment is a 4x4 grid where each state is represented as an integer from 0 to 15. The goal is to reach state 15, which gives a reward of +1. All other states give 0, and there are holes that end the episode if stepped on. Since it's slippery, each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 numbers, where each value corresponds to the action taken in that state. The actions are 0 (down/left/up), 1 (right/down/left), 2 (up/right/down), and 3 (left/up/right). 

Looking at the top-performing policies provided, the highest reward was around 0.30. The goal is to reach a global optimal reward close to 1.0, so I need to find a policy that can reliably reach state 15 without falling into holes.

The trajectories show that many policies either get stuck in loops or fall into holes quickly. For example, some trajectories loop between states or take a long time without reaching the goal. This suggests that the current policies aren't effectively navigating towards the goal or avoiding holes consistently.

Since I'm acting as a stateless optimizer, I need to focus on maximizing information gain each step. The recent policies have low rewards (0.00), so I should explore new configurations rather than tweaking existing ones.

Let me think about possible strategies:

1. **Avoiding Holes:** The agent needs to know which states are holes. From the trajectories, it seems that some holes might be in certain positions. For example, state 5 is a hole because stepping on it ends the episode. Similarly, other states like 6 or others might also be holes.

2. **Mapping Safe Paths:** To reach the goal at 15, the agent should move towards the bottom-right corner. So, from each state, the policy should guide the agent in directions that increase its chances of moving right or down, considering the slippery nature.

3. **Exploring New Policies:** Since previous policies aren't performing well, I need to propose a new set of parameters that might lead the agent towards the goal more effectively while avoiding known holes.

I'll consider setting actions for each state that prioritize moving right or down as much as possible. However, since the environment is slippery, sometimes other directions are necessary to compensate for the probabilities.

Let me sketch out some actions:

- For states in the top row (0-3), moving right might be a good idea to move towards the goal.
- For states on the left side (even columns), moving right or down could help progress towards 15.
- For states closer to the bottom-right, perhaps up or left isn't needed.

But I need to ensure that each state's action doesn't lead into a hole. Since some holes are present, the policy should avoid actions that have a high probability of leading there.

Looking at the previous params, many had varying actions but didn't perform well. Maybe setting certain states to specific actions can help create a more direct path.

Let me try creating a new set where each state's action is designed to move towards the goal:

- For states in row 0 (top), prefer moving down or right.
- For states in columns 0, prefer moving right.
- For states closer to column 3, ensure that actions lead directly to the goal.

Wait, but considering the slippery nature, sometimes taking an action might not get you where you want. So I need to choose actions whose possible outcomes have a higher chance of moving towards the goal.

For example, state 0 is top-left (0,0). Action 1 would move right, down, or left with equal probability. But if we take action 3, which allows movement left/up/right, but that's not helpful from 0 since left is invalid, so maybe better to choose an action that has a higher chance of moving right.

Alternatively, perhaps choosing action 2 for state 0: move up, right, or down. Up isn't possible from 0, so effectively, it could go right or down with probability 1/3 each and stay in place if it tries to go up.

Wait, but the environment is such that moving left from state 0 would lead to a hole (since there's no state -1). So I need to avoid actions that have a high chance of leading into holes. 

For example, in state 0 (top-left), taking action 3 allows movement left, which might be a hole. Therefore, better to choose an action that doesn't allow moving left.

Looking back at the problem statement: when the agent takes an action, it chooses from three directions with equal probability. So for each action choice, we need to ensure that none of the possible moves lead into a hole or are invalid (which would end the episode).

Therefore, in state 0, possible actions and their outcomes:

- Action 0: move down, left, up. Left is invalid (hole?), so taking action 0 could result in moving down with probability 2/3 and falling into the hole 1/3 of the time.
- Action 1: move right, down, or left. Right would take to state 1, down to state 4, left is a hole.
- Action 2: move up (invalid), right, or down. Up is invalid, so moving right with probability 1/3 and down with 2/3.
- Action 3: move left (hole), up (invalid), or right.

So in state 0, taking action 2 would have a higher chance of moving towards the goal (right) without risking going left into a hole. Similarly, taking action 0 might risk falling into the hole if it tries to go left.

Therefore, for state 0, perhaps action 1 is better because even though there's a possibility of going left, maybe right and down are safer. But I'm not sure about the exact holes' positions.

Wait, looking at the trajectories provided earlier, in one case, stepping on state 5 leads to an end. So state 5 is a hole. Similarly, other states might be holes too.

Given that, perhaps certain columns or rows have holes that need to be avoided.

Let me try to map out possible safe paths:

- From state 0: moving right (action 1) could take the agent to state 1.
- State 1: taking action 3 would allow movement left, up, or right. Moving down might lead into a hole if state 5 is one.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to look for existing policies that performed well and see how they were structured.

In the top-performing params, the first one had:

params[0]:2; ... which means from state 0, action 2 (up/right/down). But since up is invalid, the possible moves are right or down. So maybe this leads towards state 1 (right) or state 4 (down).

But considering that the trajectory for that policy was (0,1) (4,2) etc., it took a different path.

Alternatively, perhaps setting all states to move towards increasing row and column indices would help reach the goal. So, in row i, column j, actions should aim to go right or down unless near the edge.

Another approach is to use BFS from the goal state, determining the optimal paths backwards. But since it's a grid with probabilistic movements, this becomes more complex.

Given the time constraints and the need to propose a new policy, I'll create a policy where each state's action is set to move towards the right or down as much as possible, avoiding actions that could lead into known holes.

For example:

- For states in row 0 (states 0-3), choose actions that allow moving right.
- For states in column 3, choose down actions to reach the goal.
- Ensure that from any state, the chosen action doesn't have a high probability of leading into a hole.

Let me start assigning actions:

- State 0: Action 1 (right/down/left). From 0, right is safe, down leads to 4. Maybe better to choose an action that has a higher chance of moving right.
Wait, action 2 for state 0 would allow up, right, or down. Up isn't possible, so it's effectively right and down.

Alternatively, perhaps choosing action 1 allows the agent to move right (to 1) with probability 1/3, which might be better than other options.

Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe a better approach is to assign each state an action that maximizes the chance of moving towards the goal while minimizing the risk of falling into holes.

I think I'll have to make educated guesses based on the information available and propose a new set of params that are different from previous ones, focusing on moving towards the right and down as much as possible.
