You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. It's a 4x4 grid where the agent can move in four directions, but due to slipperiness, each action has three possible outcomes with equal probability. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) for a reward of +1, while avoiding holes which end the episode.

Looking at the problem, I need to define a policy as an array of 16 elements, each corresponding to a state (0-15) and indicating the action to take. The actions are 0,1,2,3 as defined. My goal is to find the configuration that maximizes the episodic reward.

From the provided information, I see that the best-performing policies so far have rewards around 0.30, which is still below the target of 1.0. This suggests that we're not yet exploiting optimally but are in the exploration phase since the rewards aren't close to the maximum possible.

The recent trajectories show some issues with getting stuck or falling into holes. For example, one policy led the agent to loop endlessly at (0,0), and another had a trajectory that ended quickly without reaching the goal. This indicates that the current policies might not be effectively navigating towards state 15 while avoiding hazards.

I need to propose a new set of parameters that will explore different paths or perhaps tweak existing ones slightly if we're in the exploit phase. Since I'm supposed to maximize information gain and avoid previously seen params, I should generate a configuration that's distinct from those listed but has a chance of improving the reward.

Considering the grid layout, states near the edges are more likely to be risky because moving left from state 0 might lead to a hole, for example. Therefore, policies should encourage movements towards the goal while avoiding actions that could lead into holes.

Perhaps I can design a policy where states closer to the bottom-right have actions aimed directly at moving right or down, depending on their position. Also, in slippery conditions, it's better to choose actions that, on average, move the agent closer to the goal even with the probabilistic outcomes.

Let me sketch out possible actions for each state:

- For states near the top-left (0-3), perhaps encourage moving right or down.
- Middle states should have a mix of directions based on their position relative to the goal.
- States near the bottom-right should push towards state 15, maybe preferring up or left if they're in the last row or column.

I also need to ensure that each action in params is from [0,1,2,3], so I'll map these choices accordingly. Since slipperiness can send the agent in unintended directions, the policy should be robust enough to handle multiple possible outcomes without getting stuck.

After considering these factors, I'll propose a new set of params where states closer to the goal have actions that statistically move towards it, while avoiding edges that lead to holes.
