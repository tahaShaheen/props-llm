You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to find the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment using a global optimization approach. I'm given an array of 16 parameters where each parameter represents the action chosen when being in a specific state (0-15). Each parameter can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.

First, understanding the environment: it's a 4x4 grid where the agent moves based on actions. The goal is to reach state 15, which yields +1 reward. Other states give 0 reward. The policy must explore holes (wholes) by reading history and avoids falling into them.

The challenge is that not all combinations of parameters will lead to a good policy. From the examples provided, it seems that some parameters can result in a reward close to zero or even negative, indicating suboptimal paths. My task is to find the optimal set where the policy maximizes the cumulative reward over time.

I should consider how each parameter affects the agent's movement and exploration. For example, when params[0] is 2, which means taking actions [down, left, up] with equal probability, this might result in more thorough exploration but could also restrict some directions. I need to balance between exploiting known good paths and exploring unexplored areas.

Considering the slippery nature of the environment, each action choice leads to different probabilities based on the given rules:

- Action 0: down, left, up (each with 1/3)
- Action 1: right, down, left
- Action 2: up, right, down
- Action 3: left, up, right

This means that certain actions might provide more opportunities to explore new areas, especially when not leading directly towards the goal.

I should also think about the transitions between states. Each action from a state leads to another state with a certain probability. For example, if in state (0,1) and taking action 3, which is left, but that would go back to (0,0). This might lead to revisiting states, causing some parameter combinations to result in slower convergence or worse performance.

To find the optimal policy, I might need to:

1. **Generate a diverse set of parameter values**: Cover all possible combinations from [0,1,2,3]^4 for each state (0-15). This is computationally intensive but necessary to find the best combination.

2. **Evaluate each param set**: For each set, simulate the agent's behavior using policy evaluation or policy gradient methods. Compute the total reward across multiple episodes to estimate the average return.

3. **Compare and select the best**: After evaluating several parameter sets, choose the one that yields the highest expected reward.

Given that the previous examples include some parameters leading to worse performance, I should focus on param sets where each state's action selection is varied enough to avoid exploitation of holes without too much risk.

I might start by experimenting with balanced actions across states. For example, ensuring that in every state, the agent has a mix of directions to explore and follow known paths. This could involve setting params[0], params[1], etc., not all being 3 or 2 but balancing the use of different action options.

Another consideration is exploiting the slippery nature: if each action choice leads to probabilistic transitions, I should ensure that in state (0,0), taking a safe path with equal probability for down, left, and up helps avoid immediate cycles and allows exploration. Similarly, in other states, it's crucial not to assume all actions lead to the same behavior.

I also need to account for the reward structure: stepping on a hole gives zero reward but ends the game if you step on one. The agent must avoid falling into holes, so each action taken should be considered for risk and reward trade-offs.

In summary, I'll create several parameter combinations where each state's action selection is varied across 0-3, focusing on balance between exploration and exploitation to maximize long-term rewards.
