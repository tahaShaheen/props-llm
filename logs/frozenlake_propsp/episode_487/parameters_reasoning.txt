You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out the best policy parameters for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to maximize the reward by reaching state 15 without falling into any holes. The agent can move in four directions, but because the environment is slippery, each action leads to three possible outcomes with equal probability.

First, I need to understand the structure of the grid. It's a 4x4 grid where each state is numbered from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). The agent starts at state 0, and the goal is at state 15. There are holes in some states which end the episode with no reward.

Given that the environment is slippery, any action taken by the agent doesn't directly lead to a specific next state but instead has a probability distribution over three possible moves. This makes it a stochastic environment, so the policy needs to account for these probabilities when choosing actions.

Looking at the previous attempts and their rewards, I see that most policies are yielding around 0.2 or lower, which is significantly below the target of 1.0. This suggests that the current strategies aren't effective enough in navigating towards the goal without falling into holes too often.

The top-performing params had a reward of 0.30, but even this isn't close to optimal. The trajectories show that some agents are getting stuck or falling into holes after just a few steps. This indicates that the policies might not be effectively avoiding holes or efficiently moving towards the goal.

I need to think about how the agent can maximize its chances of reaching state 15 without stepping on any holes. Since each action has three possible outcomes, the policy should choose actions that have the highest probability of leading towards the goal while minimizing the risk of falling into a hole.

One approach is to identify which states are safe and which lead to holes. However, since I don't have explicit information about where the holes are, I need to infer them based on previous trajectories. For example, if an agent falls into a state and doesn't proceed further, that state might be a hole.

Looking at the provided trajectories, in one case, the agent took action 0 from state 12 and moved up, but ended up falling. This suggests that certain actions from specific states may lead to holes. By analyzing these, I can try to avoid such actions.

Another consideration is encouraging movement towards the goal. The goal is at state 15, which is in the bottom-right corner. So, from each state, the optimal action should generally move the agent closer to this position. However, due to the slippery nature, choosing an action that has a high probability of moving right or down (if possible) might be beneficial.

For example, if the agent is at state 14 (which is directly above the goal), taking an action that includes moving right would give a higher chance to reach state 15. Similarly, from state 10, which is on the third row, second column, moving down or right could help progress towards the goal.

I should also consider states near the edges. For instance, in the first row (states 0-3), moving down is a safe direction since it moves into the next row without risking falling off an edge (since the grid doesn't have cliffs like some other environments). However, I need to check if moving left or right from certain states might lead to holes.

Since each action has three possible outcomes, I should choose actions that maximize the chance of moving towards the goal while minimizing the risk of hitting a hole. For example, if in state 0 (top-left), choosing an action that includes down or right movements would be better than left or up since those could lead to falling into holes or getting stuck.

Looking at previous policies, some agents are taking actions that lead them away from the goal or into loops. To avoid this, I should design a policy where each state's action choice leads towards the goal in the majority of cases, considering the slipperiness.

I also notice that some trajectories have very long sequences without reaching the goal, which might indicate cycles or ineffective paths. Therefore, the policy should encourage progress rather than staying in place or moving in circles.

Given all this, I think a possible strategy is to set each state's action to prefer movements that generally take the agent closer to the goal (right and down) while avoiding actions that could lead to holes based on previous observations. For example:

- From states where moving right leads towards the goal without obvious risks, choose actions that have a higher chance of moving right.
- Similarly, from states where moving down is safe, prioritize those actions.

Since I don't have exact hole positions, I'll base my choices on trajectories. For instance, if moving up from state 12 led to falling, then in state 12, avoiding actions that might result in moving up would be wise.

Putting this together, I can propose a set of parameters where each state's action is chosen to move towards the goal as much as possible, considering the slip probabilities. For example, for states closer to the bottom or right edges, prioritize down or right actions.

After analyzing the grid and considering these factors, I'll draft a new set of params that adjusts the previous attempts by favoring goal-oriented movements while avoiding risky actions that lead to holes.
