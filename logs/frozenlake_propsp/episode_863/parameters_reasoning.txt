You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment based on the information provided. Let's start by understanding the problem thoroughly.

The environment is a 4x4 grid where the agent can move in four directions: left, down, right, up. Each state is represented by a number from 0 to 15. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) for a reward of +1, while all other states give 0. There are holes that end the episode if the agent steps on them. The environment is slippery, so each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability.

The policy is an array of 16 elements, where each element corresponds to an action (0-3) taken in a specific state. My task is to find the optimal policy that maximizes the reward, ideally around 1.0.

Looking at the top 5 best-performing params, I see that several have f(params) between 0.3 and 0.45. The most recent policies are performing worse (like 0.05 or 0.0), which might indicate that we're still exploring and haven't found a great solution yet.

The agent is supposed to avoid holes by using the trajectories from previous attempts. So, I should think about how each policy leads to certain paths and whether those paths lead to goals or holes.

One of the top params had a trajectory like (0,1) → (4,2) → (8,2). That suggests that starting at state 0 with action 1 (which could be right), then moving down or left. But since it's slippery, it might have taken a different path. The goal is to find policies where the agent can navigate towards 15 without falling into holes.

I should consider which states are near the goal and how to guide the agent there effectively. For example, state 12 is one step above 15 (assuming rows go from top to bottom). So, for state 12, perhaps moving right would be optimal since it's adjacent to 15.

Looking at the recent policies, some have actions that lead towards the goal but might not account for hole positions. For example, a policy with action 0 in state 0 might move down or left, which could be risky if those states are holes.

I also notice that many of the top params have certain patterns, like using action 1 or 3 in some states. Maybe these actions help in navigating towards the goal without falling into holes. I should try to identify a pattern that consistently leads towards the goal while avoiding dangerous moves.

Another consideration is the slippery nature: each action has three possible outcomes. So, the policy needs to choose actions that statistically lead towards the goal over multiple steps.

Given that the recent policies are performing worse, it's probably better to switch strategies from exploration to exploitation, as per the instructions. However, since the rewards aren't close to 1.0 yet, we might still need to explore more.

I should think about which states are crucial for reaching the goal and make sure those have actions that move towards the right direction. For instance, state 8 is in the third row; moving up from there could lead back, but maybe moving right or down would be better depending on where holes are.

Wait, I don't know the exact positions of the holes. But based on the trajectories provided, some states might have led to falls. For example, one trajectory went (0,3) → ... and fell into a hole. So, perhaps state 0 with action 3 leads towards a hole in some cases.

I need to choose actions that minimize the risk of falling into holes while increasing the chances of reaching the goal. Maybe states near the edges should have specific actions. For example, on the rightmost column (states 3,7,11,15), moving up or down might be safer to avoid going out of bounds or hitting holes.

Given all this, I'll try to construct a policy where:

- States in the bottom row (12-15) have actions that move towards 15.
- Middle states have actions that guide towards the right or bottom.
- Avoiding actions that lead towards known dangerous areas based on previous trajectories.

Looking at the top policies, some have action 0 for state 0. Let me try a policy where state 0 takes action 2 (up), which might move it to other positions, but given the slippery nature, it could explore different paths without falling into holes.

Alternatively, maybe state 0 should take action 1 (right) to head towards the goal. But I need to ensure that this doesn't lead into a hole in some cases.

Considering all these factors, I'll propose a new policy where each state is assigned an action that statistically moves closer to the goal while avoiding known risky paths.
