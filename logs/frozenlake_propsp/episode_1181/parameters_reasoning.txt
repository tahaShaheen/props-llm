You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Okay, so I need to help find the global optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment. Let me try to understand the problem first.

The environment is a 4x4 grid where each state is represented by numbers from 0 to 15. The goal is to reach state 15, which gives a reward of +1, while all other states give 0. However, there are holes that end the episode if stepped on. The agent's actions are slippery; when it takes an action, it moves in one of three directions with equal probability.

The policy is defined by an array 'params' where each element corresponds to a state and determines which action to take. My task is to propose new 'params' values that haven't been tried before, aiming for the highest possible reward (ideally around 1.0).

Looking at the top-performing params, they all have rewards below 0.45, which suggests we're not yet close to the optimal solution. So, I should focus on exploration rather than exploitation.

In previous attempts, the policies seem to be getting stuck or falling into loops. For example, some trajectories show repeated moves between states without progressing towards the goal. This indicates that the current policies might not be effectively navigating around the holes or reaching state 15 efficiently.

I need to design a policy that can navigate from any starting position to state 15 while avoiding holes. Since the environment is slippery, each action taken has a probability of moving in three different directions. Therefore, the policy must account for this uncertainty and choose actions that maximize the chance of reaching the goal without falling into holes.

Let me think about the structure of the grid:

- State 0 is top-left (0,0), state 15 is bottom-right (3,3).
- The agent can move in four directions, but due to slipperiness, each action leads to one of three possible moves with equal probability.

To reach state 15, the optimal path would likely involve moving right and down as needed. However, because of the slippery nature, the agent's intended action might not result in the expected movement. So, the policy needs to choose actions that have a higher probability of leading towards the goal, considering all possible outcomes.

Looking at some previous policies, many seem to be taking action 1 (right/down/left) or action 0 (down/left/up). These actions might not effectively guide the agent towards the goal because they can lead the agent in multiple directions.

Maybe I should design a policy where each state's action is chosen based on its position relative to the goal. For example, if the agent is in a state closer to the top-left, it should take actions that generally move it right and down. But since the environment is slippery, the agent might need to adjust its actions based on proximity to the edges or holes.

Additionally, considering the holes, I need to make sure that certain states do not choose actions that could lead into known hole positions. For example, if a state near a hole chooses an action that has a high probability of moving into the hole, it's better to avoid such actions.

Since the agent can't remember previous attempts and is stateless, each proposed policy must be self-contained and effective on its own without relying on past knowledge. Therefore, I need to come up with a general strategy that works across all states.

Perhaps implementing a greedy approach where each state chooses an action that has the highest probability of moving towards the goal. For instance, from state 0 (top-left), choosing an action that tends to move right or down. Similarly, for other states, actions should be selected based on their position relative to the goal and avoiding areas with holes.

I also notice that some previous policies have high rewards but don't reach the goal consistently. Maybe by adjusting certain states' actions to prioritize moving towards the goal more directly, I can increase the overall reward.

After considering all this, I think a possible approach is to set each state's action based on its row and column position. For example:

- In the top row (states 0-3), prefer moving down or right.
- In the leftmost column (states 0,4,8,12), prefer moving right.
- In other states, choose actions that move towards increasing either row or column indices.

However, since each action leads to three possible moves, I need to ensure that the chosen action has a higher chance of leading towards the goal without falling into holes.

Given all this, let me propose a new set of parameters where each state's action is selected based on moving as close to the goal as possible. For example:

- States in the top-left quadrant (0-3) might choose actions that tend right or down.
- Middle states should balance between moving towards the right and bottom.

I'll map out such a policy, ensuring that from each state, the chosen action is one that has a higher probability of leading towards state 15 without falling into known holes. This should help increase the reward over time by guiding the agent more effectively towards the goal.
