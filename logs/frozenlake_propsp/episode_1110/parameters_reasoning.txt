You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me try to understand the problem first.

The grid is 4x4, with states numbered from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). The agent can move in four directions: left, down, right, up. But because it's slippery, when an action is taken, there's a 33% chance the agent will move in one of three possible directions. So each action leads to three possible next states with equal probability.

The goal is state 15, which gives +1 reward. All other states give 0. There are some holes (I assume these are the 'F' states in the original FrozenLake but not specified here). The policy is a function mapping each state (0-15) to an action (0-3), and I need to find the params array of length 16 with values from [0,1,2,3].

The user has provided some top-performing params with their rewards and trajectories. From these, it looks like most policies are getting around 0.35 to 0.45 average reward over 20 episodes.

My goal is to propose a new set of params that's different from previous ones to explore further and maximize information gain. Since the current best reward is below 1.0 (the theoretical maximum), I'm in "Explorer" mode, so I should try new configurations instead of tweaking existing good ones.

Looking at the top params, they seem to have a pattern where certain states are set to specific actions. For example, many have state 0 set to action 1 or 2, and state 15 is often set to 3 (right), which makes sense because it's the goal. But since there are holes, I need to ensure that the policy doesn't lead into them.

I should choose a params array where each state has an action that maximizes the chance of reaching 15 without falling into holes. Since the environment is slippery, the agent needs actions that have high probability of moving towards the goal despite the randomness.

Maybe I can structure it so that in each row, the policy tries to move right or down as much as possible, considering the slippery nature. For example, from state 0 (top-left), action 1 could be right, but due to slipperiness, it might go down, left, or up. But wait, if I set action 0 for state 0, which would try to move down, but because of the slip, there's a chance to move left, down, or up. That might not be ideal.

Alternatively, perhaps setting each state's action to the direction that has the highest probability of moving towards the goal. For example, in the top row (states 0-3), trying to move right would help reach higher-numbered states, which are closer to 15. But considering the slipperiness, maybe choosing actions that have a higher chance of progressing towards the goal.

Looking at previous params, they often set state 0 to action 1 or 2. Let's see what those do. Action 1 for state 0 would try to move right, but with equal probability to down and left. Maybe it's better to choose an action that has a higher chance of moving towards the goal despite the slip.

Alternatively, perhaps setting each state's action such that on average, it moves closer to the goal. For example, in state 0 (top-left), choosing action 1 (right) would have a 33% chance to move right, which is towards the goal, and 33% down and left. But maybe another action could be better.

Wait, but since each action has three possible outcomes, it's hard to predict exactly where you'll end up. So perhaps the optimal policy needs to explore all possible paths while avoiding holes.

Given that the previous best params had some states set to specific actions, I need to vary them to find a better configuration. For example, maybe changing state 1 from action 3 (up) to another action might help avoid a hole.

Alternatively, perhaps focusing on getting to state 15 as quickly as possible without falling into holes by setting the policy in each row to move right or down, depending on the position.

I think I'll try setting most states to action 2 or 3, which are right and up. Wait, no—action 0 is down, 1 is right? Wait, let me check:

Wait, according to the problem statement:
- Action 0: [down, left, up]
- Action 1: [right, down, left]
- Action 2: [up, right, down]
- Action 3: [left, up, right]

So each action has three possible directions. For example, action 0 from state 0 would have a 33% chance to move down (to state 4), left (state remains 0 if at edge?), or up (can't go up from row 0, so perhaps it stays? Or is there wrap-around? The problem doesn't specify, but I think going up from row 0 would stay in the same row. Wait, no—probably, moving up from state 0 (top-left) would either stay in place or move to another valid state. But since it's a grid, perhaps edges have walls.

But regardless, for each action, there are three possible moves with equal probability.

To maximize reaching state 15, I want the agent to generally move right and down because that leads towards the goal.

So let's think: in row 0 (states 0-3), moving right is better. So perhaps setting actions here to encourage right movement.

But each action has a mix of directions. For example:

If state 0 takes action 1, which can move right, down, or left. From state 0, moving right would take it to state 1, down to state 4, left would stay at state 0 (assuming no wrap-around).

Alternatively, action 2 for state 0: [up, right, down]. Since up isn't possible from row 0, perhaps it stays or maybe goes to a hole. Wait, but the problem says holes are present, so moving in an impossible direction might lead to a hole.

Wait, no—the environment is defined with holes that end the episode if stepped on. So I need to make sure that none of the possible next states from an action leads into a hole.

But since I don't know where the holes are, I have to infer based on previous trajectories. Looking at the top params and their trajectories, some went into loops or fell into holes.

For example, in one trajectory: (0,1) (1,3) (2,1) ... it looped around without reaching 15, suggesting that those actions led to not progressing towards the goal.

So maybe I need a policy that avoids getting stuck in cycles and moves more directly towards the goal.

I think a possible approach is to set each state's action to try moving as much as possible right or down. For example:

- In row 0: move right (action 1)
- In row 1: move down (action 0) if not on the last column, else right
- Similarly for other rows.

But considering the slippery nature, each action will have a 33% chance to go in three directions. So perhaps setting actions that, on average, push towards the goal despite the randomness.

Another thought: since the environment is slippery and stochastic, it's challenging to plan deterministic paths. Instead, the policy should encourage movement towards the goal across all possible outcomes.

Let me try constructing a params array where each state's action is chosen to have the highest probability of moving towards the goal.

For example:

- In states 0-3 (top row), set action to move right as much as possible.
- In states 4-7 (second row), set action to move down if possible, else right.
- Similarly for other rows.

But I need to translate this into specific actions. Let's map each state to an action that has the best chance of moving towards 15.

Looking at each state:

State 0: top-left. To get to 15, needs to move right or down. Action 1 (right) from state 0 can go to 1, 4, or stay. But since it's slippery, maybe action 2 could be better because it has a chance to move up, but that might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps setting state 0 to action 1 (right), which allows moving right with 33% chance, down 33%, and left 33%. Since left would keep it in place, maybe that's worse than other options. Alternatively, action 2 for state 0 could have a chance to move up (which might not help) or right/down.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should look at the previous best params and see what they did differently. The top params had:

params[0]:1; ... which means action 1 (right) from state 0.

But in their trajectory, it led to loops. So perhaps changing that would help.

Maybe setting state 0 to action 2, which includes right as one of the options. Let's see what action 2 does: [up, right, down]. From state 0, up isn't possible, so maybe it stays or goes into a hole? Or perhaps it wraps around, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps setting state 0 to action 3 (left) might not be good because moving left from state 0 would stay in place or go into a hole.

Hmm. Maybe the key is to set each state's action such that on average, the agent moves towards the goal despite the slipperiness.

Another approach: since the environment is Markovian and the policy must be stationary, perhaps using Q-learning or other RL methods could help, but in this case, I'm supposed to propose policies step by step without remembering previous steps.

Given that, I think the best strategy is to propose a new set of params that explores different actions than previously tried. For example, changing some key states' actions and leaving others as they are.

Looking at the most recent params:

One had state 0:1; another had state 0:2. So maybe trying a new action for state 0, say action 3.

But wait, what does action 3 do? It allows moving left, up, or right with equal probability. From state 0 (top-left), moving left would stay in place, up might be invalid (so perhaps leads to a hole?), and right moves to state 1. So maybe it's better than action 1 which also includes down.

Alternatively, setting state 0:3 could allow some chance to move right without going down, but I'm not sure.

I think I'll try setting state 0 to action 2 (up, right, down). From state 0, moving up isn't possible, so maybe it stays or falls into a hole. That's risky, but perhaps the other options are better.

Alternatively, maybe set state 0:3 to have a chance to move left, which might not be good.

Wait, no—action 3 for state 0 would allow moving left (stays in place), up (invalid, possibly a hole), or right. So it's a 33% chance each.

This is tricky. Maybe I should look at other states and see how their actions could be set to avoid holes.

For example, state 4: which is the top-middle-left. What action does the top params have? They have state 4:0, which is action down (to state 8). But if there's a hole in state 8, that would be bad.

Looking at the trajectory for one of the top params:

Trajectory: (0,1) (1,3) (2,1) (3,3) ... So from state 0 with action 1 (right), it goes to state 1. Then from state 1, action 3 (left? Or what is action 3's possible moves). Wait, action 3 for state 1 would allow moving left (to state 0), up (state remains?), or right (state 2).

But the trajectory shows that from state 1, it took action 3 and went to state 3. Hmm.

This suggests that setting action 3 for state 1 might lead towards higher-numbered states, which is good.

Alternatively, maybe changing some of these actions could help avoid holes or reach the goal faster.

Another idea: set all states except the last row to move right, and the last row to stay (action 0), but that might not be optimal.

Wait, no—because in the last row (states 12-15), moving right from state 14 would take you to 15. So perhaps setting action 3 for states 12-14 to move right.

But considering the slipperiness, it's probabilistic.

I think I'll try proposing a new set of params where each state is set to an action that has the highest chance of moving towards the goal without leading into holes based on previous trajectories. For example:

- States 0-3: set to action 1 (right)
- States 4-7: set to action 0 (down)
- States 8-11: set to action 0 (down) if possible, else right
- States 12-15: set to action 3 (right) to reach the goal

But I need to map this into specific actions.

Alternatively, perhaps setting all states in even-numbered columns to move right and odd-numbered to move down or something like that.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to look at each state and decide which action would give the best chance of moving towards 15 without hitting holes.

For example:

- State 0: try to move right (action 1)
- State 1: try to move down (action 0) or right (action 1)
- And so on.

But without knowing where the holes are, it's hard. However, based on previous trajectories, some states seem to be problematic when taking certain actions. For example, state 4 in one trajectory led to state 8, which might have a hole.

So perhaps for state 4, instead of action 0 (down), set to action 1 (right) or action 2 (up).

Wait, but up from state 4 would take it back to row 0, which is further away. So maybe better to move right.

Alternatively, setting state 4: action 3 (left) could lead to state 3 or something else.

This is getting too vague. Maybe I should try a params array that's different from previous ones but follows a logical path towards the goal.

I'll propose:

- For states in row 0 (0-3), set action to move right (action 1)
- For states in row 1 (4-7), set action to move down (action 0)
- For states in row 2 (8-11), set action to move down (action 0) if possible, else right
- For states in row 3 (12-15), set action to move right (action 3)

But let me map this out.

Alternatively, perhaps setting each state's action based on their position relative to the goal. For example:

- If a state is in an earlier row or column than the goal, move down or right accordingly.

I think I'll go with that approach and propose a new params array.
