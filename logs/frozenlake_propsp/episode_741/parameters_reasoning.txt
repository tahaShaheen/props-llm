You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15, which gives a reward of +1, and avoid the holes. From the problem description, I know that each action has three possible outcomes due to the slippery nature of the grid.

Looking at the top performing policies provided, they all have an average reward around 0.25-0.45. That's significantly below the target of 1.0, which suggests we're not yet exploiting optimally. The recent params seem to be exploring different strategies but haven't found a path that consistently reaches the goal without falling into holes.

I notice that in some trajectories, agents get stuck in loops or end up in holes. For example, one trajectory went from (0,3) and kept moving left, which probably led it into a hole. To avoid this, I need to ensure that each state's policy leads towards the goal without getting trapped.

Looking at the grid layout, state 15 is at the bottom right. So, starting from any state, the optimal path would be to move either down or right as much as possible, considering the slippery nature. But since actions are probabilistic, the agent needs a policy that statistically increases the chance of moving towards the goal.

I also need to avoid states that are holes. From the trajectories, I can infer which states might be holes based on where agents fall. For instance, getting stuck at (0,3) suggests that state 3 is a hole or leads to one.

So, for each state, I should choose an action that maximizes the probability of moving towards the goal while avoiding known dangerous paths. Let's map out possible safe moves:

- State 15: goal, no action needed.
- States near the bottom right (like 12,13,14) should move right or down to reach 15.
- For other states, prioritize actions that generally push towards the bottom-right direction.

Considering the slippery nature, choosing actions that have a higher chance of moving in the desired direction. For example, from state 0 (top-left), action 1 (right, down, left) might be better because right moves towards goal, while down also does so. Similarly, other states should choose actions that statistically push them towards the goal.

I'll construct a policy where each state chooses an action that has the highest chance of moving closer to the goal or avoiding holes. Since all actions are equally likely in their respective directions, I need to pick the action set that offers the best path.
