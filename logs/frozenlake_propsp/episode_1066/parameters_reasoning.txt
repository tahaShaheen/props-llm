You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the best next step for the policy parameters in this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward by reaching state 15 without falling into any holes. 

First, looking at the environment details: it's a 4x4 grid with slippery movements. Each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability. This means that even if I choose an optimal action, there's still a chance the agent might not go where intended. The reward is +1 for reaching state 15 and 0 otherwise, but some states are holes which end the episode.

The current best policies have rewards around 0.45, which is lower than the target of 1.0. So, I'm in the exploration phase since we're not close to the optimal reward yet. My task is to propose a new set of parameters that explore different paths without falling into holes, aiming to maximize information gain for future iterations.

Looking at the top-performing params provided earlier, they all have similar structures but with slight variations. For example, in state 0, some choose action 1 or 2. Since the environment is slippery, I need actions that have a higher probability of moving towards the goal while avoiding holes.

One approach is to ensure that each state's policy action directs the agent closer to the goal, considering the possible slip probabilities. For instance, from state 0 (top-left corner), moving right or down might be optimal. However, because of the slippery nature, choosing actions that have a higher chance of progressing towards the goal despite the randomness is key.

I also need to avoid holes. From the trajectories provided, it seems some states like 4 (second row first column) and others are risky. So, I should make sure that from each state, the chosen action doesn't lead into known hole positions when considering all possible movement outcomes.

Let me outline a potential strategy: for each state, determine which action has the highest chance of leading towards the goal without hitting holes. For example:
- State 0 (top-left): choosing right or down could help move towards the goal.
- Middle states should aim to move towards the bottom-right direction but be cautious of their surroundings.

Considering all this, I'll design a new set of parameters where each state's action is chosen to maximize the chance of moving closer to state 15 while avoiding holes. This might involve varying actions per state based on their position and possible movement outcomes.

After considering these factors, here's my proposed parameter configuration:
</think>

params[0]: 2, params[1]: 3, params[2]: 1, params[3]: 3, params[4]: 0, params[5]: 1, params[6]: 1, params[7]: 2, params[8]: 3, params[9]: 1, params[10]: 2, params[11]: 3, params[12]: 1, params[13]: 3, params[14]: 2, params[15]: 3
