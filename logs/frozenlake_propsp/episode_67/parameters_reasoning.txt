You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to help find the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment using a policy optimizer. The goal is to maximize the reward by avoiding the hole in the map. The current strategy seems too random since it's just sampling actions based on parameters that are either 0 or 1. 

First, I remember that each state transition and action selection depends on the current policy. For the top-left state (0), the agent can move down, left, or up, each with equal probability when using an epsilon-greedy approach. But since we're not using any exploration (epsilon is probably zero), it's just deterministic—always take the best action.

I need to figure out which parameters params[0] through params[15] will lead the agent towards the hole more effectively. Each parameter corresponds to a state, so changing them affects where the policy directs the agent from that state onwards.

Looking at the top performing examples provided, some have higher rewards around 0.25 or even slightly above zero. These seem better than just 0.15 as in many cases. So I'm looking for parameters that cause the agent to take more optimal actions towards the hole without entering the hole.

For instance, params[6] is set to 1, which means when at state 6 (rightmost middle), the action is right. However, state 6 is next to the hole and seems dangerous because moving left from there would hit it. So if params[6] were higher, maybe taking a safer action could be better.

Also, looking at other parameters like params[1], which directs actions when on top row (state 0-3), I see some that take right or down more often. But state 0 is the starting point, and sometimes moving up from there might lead to the hole. So if params[2] is too high for state 0, it could cause immediate failure.

Another observation: parameters around 1 seem to have better rewards because they allow for safer actions without getting stuck on dangerous states. For example, params[7], [9], and [14] are higher than others in their respective top rows, leading the agent through less risky areas.

I think focusing on improving parameters that control transitions between state 6 (the hole) would be key. For instance, if state 5 is a high reward, maybe params[5] being lower could allow the agent to take other paths instead of directly into the hole. Similarly, higher params for states near the hole might redirect the path away from it.

Overall, I need to adjust parameters that affect transitions leading into and out of the hole, ensuring the agent doesn't fall into it while maximizing the reward in surrounding areas.
