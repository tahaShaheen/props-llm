You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get an average reward as close to 1.0 as possible, meaning the agent should reliably reach state 15 without falling into any holes.

First, looking at the problem description, the environment is a 4x4 grid where each cell is represented by states 0 to 15. The slippery nature of the ice means that when an action is taken, there's a 33% chance to go in one of three directions. So, from any given state, moving in the intended direction isn't guaranteed; the agent could end up sliding left, right, or down/up depending on the action.

The holes are present in some cells, and stepping into them ends the episode with no reward. The only rewarding state is 15, where the agent gets +1.

Looking at the parameters provided, each params[i] represents the action taken when in state i. So I need to assign actions (0-3) to each of these states such that the policy maximizes the chance of reaching 15 while avoiding holes.

The user has given a buffer of top performing policies and their rewards, along with some trajectories. The highest reward observed is around 0.45, which suggests there's room for improvement.

In the most recent params, we see several configurations. For example:

- One policy had all params set to move right (action 1) or other directions but ended up getting a low reward of 0.15.
- Another tried different actions but still only achieved 0.20.
- The last one with f(params): 0.00 didn't reach the goal.

The top policies have higher rewards, but none are close to 1.0, so I'm in "Explorer" mode. My task is to propose a new set of params that's distinct from previous attempts and could potentially explore new trajectories to gather more information about where the holes are.

I notice that many of the top policies are trying to move towards the right or down, but maybe they're not considering all possible paths due to the slippery nature. So perhaps I should design a policy that allows for more flexibility in movement, ensuring that from each state, the agent can still reach 15 without stepping into holes.

I'll start by looking at some key states:

- State 0 (top-left corner): From here, moving right or down makes sense since it's closer to the goal. Since action 0 leads to [down, left, up], which might not be ideal because from state 0, moving up isn't possible. So perhaps action 1 is better as it allows movement right, which is towards the goal.

Wait, no, in the problem statement, when taking action 0, the agent can move down, left, or up. Since state 0 is (0,0), moving up would take it to nowhere, so it might loop or stay. Similarly, moving left from state 0 isn't possible either. So perhaps action 1 is better because from state 0, taking action 1 allows movement right with a chance.

Similarly, for other states near the edges and holes, I need to make sure that their actions don't lead into known holes.

Looking at previous trajectories, some agents fell into loops or went through paths that led them into holes. So perhaps I should design a policy that encourages moving towards 15 while avoiding areas with holes.

Let me think of each state's optimal action:

- State 0 (0,0): action 1 (right) to move towards the goal.
- State 1 (0,1): action 3 (up, right, left). Wait, no—action 3 from state 1 would have a chance to go up (which is impossible as it's top row), so perhaps better to choose an action that moves down or right.

Wait, but in the problem statement, each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability. So I need to assign actions such that from each state, the intended direction is one of the possible movements that could lead towards 15 without hitting holes.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to look for existing optimal policies or known solutions for FrozenLake with slippery ice. In standard FrozenLake (8x8), the optimal policy can be found using methods like Q-learning. However, here it's 4x4 and slippery, so the policy needs to account for the uncertainty.

In standard FrozenLake without slipperiness, the optimal actions are well-known. But with slipperiness, the agent has to take into account that each action only gives a 1/3 chance of moving in the intended direction. Therefore, the policy must be designed such that from each state, on average, it still progresses towards the goal.

I think a common approach is to move towards the right and down as much as possible since those are the directions that would take the agent closer to the goal (state 15). So perhaps setting actions for states in the top row to move right or down, middle rows to also prefer moving towards the bottom-right direction.

Looking at the most recent policies, I see that some have params[0] set to 1 (right) and others to 2. Let me try setting params[0] to 1 again but vary other states.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider making sure that in each state, the agent has a chance to move towards the goal without getting stuck. For example, from state 4 (which is (1,0)), moving right or down might be better.

Wait, perhaps the best approach is to design a policy where each state's action is chosen such that it maximizes the probability of eventually reaching 15. Given the slipperiness, it's essential to have redundancy in actions so that even if the agent doesn't take the intended path, it can still reach the goal.

I think setting all states to move towards the right or down as much as possible would be beneficial. So for each state:

- If moving right is possible without hitting a hole, choose action 1.
- Else, choose an action that allows movement towards down.

But since I don't know where the holes are exactly, based on previous trajectories, I can infer some potential holes. For example, in the top policies, some trajectories ended quickly when taking certain actions, which might indicate proximity to a hole.

Looking at the trajectory for the best policy (0.45 reward): (0,1) (4,2) (8,2). This suggests that from state 4, action 2 was taken, leading to state 8. So maybe state 4's action is set to move down or right.

Wait, in the top policies, params[4] is often 0 or 2. Let me see:

In the first top policy, params[4] was 0, which for state 4 (1,0) would be action 0, leading to [down, left, up]. Down from state 4 takes it to state 8, which is correct.

But since the environment is slippery, maybe having a mix of actions that can navigate around potential holes is better.

Alternatively, perhaps setting all states except those near the goal to move right or down, and the last few rows to move towards the exit.

Another approach: let's look at each state's possible moves. For example:

- State 0 (0,0): moving right leads to state 1; moving down leads to state 4.
- So action 1 for state 0 would allow a chance to go right or down, which are both towards the goal.

Similarly, state 1 (0,1): moving right goes to state 2, moving down to state 5. Both are towards the goal.

State 2 (0,2): moving right to state 3, down to state 6.
State 3 (0,3): moving right would go out of bounds or perhaps stay? Wait, in a 4x4 grid, columns are 0-3, so from state 3 (0,3), moving right is impossible. So action 3 for state 3 might have options that include moving up (invalid) and others.

Wait, no—each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability. For example:

Action 0: down, left, up.
From state 3 (0,3):
- Down leads to state 7.
- Left leads to state 2.
- Up is invalid, so perhaps it stays or wraps? Or maybe in this environment, moving up from the top row keeps you in place.

Assuming that moving in an impossible direction doesn't change the state, then for state 3 (0,3), action 0 would have a 1/3 chance to stay (if up is invalid). Similarly, other actions might lead to different states.

Given this, perhaps it's better to assign actions that encourage movement towards the goal without getting stuck in loops or near holes.

I think an optimal policy for FrozenLake with slipperiness would involve always trying to move towards the right and down as much as possible. So I'll design the params accordingly:

- For states 0 (top-left), set action 1 (right) or 0 (down).
- For states in the top row, set actions that move right where possible.
- For states in the left column, set actions that move down.

But since I don't have exact knowledge of the holes' locations, I'll assume that certain paths are safe based on previous trajectories. For example, from state 4 (1,0), action 0 leads to state 8 with some probability.

Looking at the most recent policies, many set params[0] to 1 or 2. To explore a new configuration, perhaps setting params[0] to 3 would be beneficial? Or maybe varying other states.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a policy that allows more exploration in the early stages to avoid holes.

Given that previous attempts have yielded around 0.45 as the best reward, which is significantly below 1.0, it's clear that the current policies aren't optimal. So I need to try something different.

Maybe setting all states except those near the goal to move right and down consistently could help. For example:

- States in top-left (0-3): action 1 or 2.
- Middle states: action 2 or 3.
- Bottom-right states: action 3 to reach the goal.

But I'm not sure, so perhaps a better approach is to look for existing optimal policies for similar environments. In standard FrozenLake, the optimal Q-values can be found using algorithms, but with slipperiness, it's more complex.

Wait, maybe I should consider that each action only gives a 1/3 chance of moving in the intended direction. Therefore, from each state, choosing an action that has the highest probability of eventually reaching the goal considering all possible transitions.

Alternatively, perhaps setting each state to have an action that tries to move towards the right or down as much as possible, given their position.

For example:

- For states in row 0 (states 0-3), set action 1 (right) for most.
- For states in column 3 (states 3,7,11,15), set action 2 or 3 to move down or right, but since they're already at the edge, maybe down is better.

Wait, state 15 is the goal. So from state 14, which is (3,1), moving right would take it to 15. So perhaps setting params[14] to action 2 (right) would be ideal.

Similarly, for state 13 (3,0): moving up, right, or down. Since moving right from 13 goes to 14, which is closer to the goal. So maybe set params[13] to action 3 (which includes right).

But I'm not sure about all states. Maybe it's better to systematically assign actions:

- For each state, choose an action that increases the row or column index towards 15.
- Prefer right and down movements.

Given that, let me try constructing a policy where:

- States in top-left (0): move right (action 1).
- State 1: move right (action 1) to go to state 2 or down to 5.
- State 2: move right (action 1) to state 3 or down to 6.
- State 3: can't move right, so perhaps action 3 to try moving up, but since it's the top row, maybe action 0 which allows down.

Wait, from state 3 (0,3), action 0 would let it go down with 1/3 chance. So setting params[3] = 0 might be better than others.

Similarly, for state 4 (1,0): moving down to 8 or right to 5. So set action 2 (which includes down and right) perhaps?

Wait, each action has specific movement options:

- Action 0: down, left, up.
- Action 1: right, down, left.
- Action 2: up, right, down.
- Action 3: left, up, right.

So for state 4 (1,0):

- Action 0 would allow moving down to 8, left to 0, or up to nowhere.
- Action 1 allows moving right to 5, down to 8, or left to 0.
- So both actions 0 and 1 have a chance to move towards the goal (down to 8).

But action 2 for state 4 would be up, right, down: which includes right to 5 and down to 8.

Similarly, action 3 would allow moving left (to 0), up (nowhere), or right (to 5).

So perhaps setting params[4] = 1 or 2 would give better chances of moving towards the goal.

But I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to choose an action that allows movement towards both right and down, so actions that include these directions are preferable.

In any case, given the time constraints and the need to propose a new policy distinct from previous ones, I'll try setting some states to different actions to see if they can lead to higher rewards.

For example:

- Set params[0] = 1 (right).
- For states along the top row, set action 1 or 2.
- For middle states, set actions that move towards down or right.
- Ensure that near the goal, actions are set to reach state 15 with high probability.

But without knowing the exact hole positions, it's challenging. So I'll make an educated guess based on standard approaches and previous attempts.

One approach is to mirror the best-performing policies but tweak some parameters. For example, in the top policy, params[0] was set to 1, so maybe try changing that or other states to see if a higher reward can be achieved.

Alternatively, perhaps setting all states except those near holes to move right and down consistently could help avoid pitfalls.

Given all this, I'll construct a new params array where:

- States in the top-left (0) set to action 1 (right).
- Middle states set to action 2 or 3.
- Bottom-right states set to actions that push towards the goal.

But since I can't be certain without testing, I'll propose a policy that's different from previous ones. Looking at the recent params, many have params[0] = 1 and others vary. To explore, perhaps setting some states to action 3 or 2 could help.

After considering all this, I think a possible new configuration is:

params[0]: 2; params[1]: 3; params[2]: 1; ... etc., but I need to make sure it's unique and hasn't been tried before.

Wait, looking at the top policies, several have similar structures. To avoid repetition, perhaps set a few states differently.

Alternatively, maybe setting all states in row 0 (states 0-3) to action 1 (right), except state 3 which might be better as action 0 or 3.

But I'm not sure. Given the time, I'll proceed with proposing a new params that differs from previous ones, focusing on moving towards right and down where possible.
