You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right) with maximum reward while avoiding holes. Let me think through this step by step.

First, understanding the environment: It's a 4x4 grid where each move can lead to one of three directions randomly because of the slippery nature. Each action has a 33% chance of going in three possible directions. The policy is an array of 16 numbers, each from 0-3, indicating which action to take in each state.

Looking at the provided data, the best performing params had a reward around 0.45, but we aim for around 1.0, so there's room for improvement. The recent attempts have lower rewards, suggesting maybe I'm not getting closer yet.

The top 5 best params mostly seem to try different paths towards state 15. For example, some trajectories go through state 0 (top-left) and move down or right. Others take longer paths but eventually reach the goal.

In the recent attempts, params have been varied, but the rewards are still low. This might mean that either the policies aren't effectively navigating towards the goal or they're falling into holes too often.

I notice that in the top 5, some trajectories end quickly because they hit a hole or reach the goal early. For example, one trajectory went (0,1) then to state 4 and 8, which is moving down twice but might have fallen into a hole or reached the goal. Another ended at state 15 with a reward of 0.45.

To improve, I should look for policies that systematically move towards the goal without getting stuck in loops or falling into holes. Maybe focusing on states near the bottom-right and ensuring their actions lead towards the goal.

Looking at state 15, which is the goal, so that's already correct. For other states, like 14 (second to last), perhaps action 3 (right) would take it to 15. Similarly, for state 12, moving right or up might help.

Wait, but considering the slippery nature, each action has a 33% chance of going in three directions. So even if we set an action towards the goal, there's a risk of moving elsewhere. Therefore, the policy needs to choose actions that maximize the probability of reaching the goal despite the slipperiness.

Maybe for states near the edges, certain actions are more reliable. For example, from state 0 (top-left), taking action 1 or 2 might have better chances of moving towards the right or down.

In previous attempts, params[0] was often set to 1 or 2. Let me see if changing that could help. Maybe setting it to 3 could push more towards the right and up, which might not be as effective. Alternatively, action 1 from state 0 could go right, down, or left with equal probability.

Wait, but in the initial setup, each action has a specific set of possible moves. For example, action 0 from any state leads to [down, left, up], each with 33% chance. So maybe choosing actions that have a higher chance of moving towards the goal direction despite the slipperiness.

I think a good strategy is to make sure that for each state, the chosen action has at least one move that goes towards the goal, increasing the chances of eventually reaching it without falling into holes.

Looking at the most recent params, some had low rewards because they kept looping or hitting holes. So perhaps I need to adjust the actions in states near potential holes to avoid them.

For example, state 5 is in the second row (4-7), position (1,1). If we set action 0 here, possible moves are down, left, up. But maybe moving right would be better towards the goal. So perhaps setting params[5] to 2 or 3 might help.

But since I can't remember previous attempts, as per the instructions, each response must be based solely on the current information in the buffer. The key is to maximize information gain for the next iteration.

Given that the rewards are still below 1.0, I'm supposed to act as an "Explorer" and propose a new configuration distinct from previous ones to gather more data.

Looking at the recent params, they've been trying various combinations but haven't reached the optimal reward yet. So maybe I should try setting certain states to actions that have not been tried before or that could provide new information about avoiding holes or reaching the goal.

For example, perhaps in state 1 (top-middle), instead of action 3 which was common, setting it to 0 might push more towards down, left, or up. Or maybe changing some key states' actions from what's been tried before.

I should also ensure that for each state near the bottom-right corner, the action chosen has a high probability of moving closer to state 15. For instance, in state 14 (which is directly below 15), taking an action that includes moving right would be ideal.

In summary, I'll propose a new set of params where certain key states have different actions than what's been tried before, focusing on increasing the chances of moving towards the goal and avoiding holes. This should help gather more data to either confirm better reward or identify new issues.
