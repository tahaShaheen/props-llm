You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy parameters for this FrozenLake environment with the slippery rule. The goal is to reach state 15, which is the bottom right corner. All other states give a reward of 0, but stepping into the hole (state 7) ends the episode, and if you step on it, that's an error.

The policy function takes a state as input and outputs an action (0-3), each corresponding to different directions. The current parameters are all set to 1, which is a neutral choice—each action has equal probability when selecting from possible options. But the user wants me to propose new values for params[0] through [14] such that the reward f(params) is as high as possible.

Looking at the examples provided, some have higher rewards like 1.00 and others around 0.25 or lower. The best example has a reward of 1.00, which seems like a local optimum because there are more states with similar rewards. Other higher rewards aren't shown in the top list, so I'm looking for parameters that balance exploration and exploitation.

I remember from the examples, some policies use combinations like [2,0,3,2] leading to 1.00 reward, others have lower rewards but still manage exploration better. Maybe trying a mix of higher and lower action probabilities can help the agent explore more and avoid getting stuck on the hole.

Let me think about each state:

- State 7 is the hole; stepping on it gives -1 (or wait, does that happen?). Wait, the reward for the hole isn't mentioned in the examples. Looking back, all examples I have don't show a reward of -1 for the hole. Maybe stepping on it doesn't give a penalty but ends the episode. So if the agent steps into 7, it's an error.

In the existing examples, some parameters like [2:3:1:3], which would take action 2 from state 0 (up), 3 from state 1 (right/down/left), etc. But maybe using more balanced probabilities could help the agent explore better. For instance, if I set params[i] to 2 for certain states and 0 or 1 for others, that might encourage exploration.

Another approach is using a Boltzmann distribution where higher values make actions less likely, encouraging exploration, while lower values keep them more probable. But since each state's action selection depends on its local neighborhood (from the policy), I need to set params in such a way that states with similar rewards are treated similarly but encourage moving away from bad paths.

Wait, maybe using 2 for states where movement is less likely to lead towards the hole could help. Let me consider the states around the hole. For example, state 7 is surrounded by certain states; if these have lower probabilities of taking other actions that might lead into the hole, then params[i] being 0 or 1 might encourage exploring those paths.

Looking at some examples:

- The first top performing parameter set uses [2:3:1:3], which suggests action 2 (up) is more likely from state 0. Maybe to avoid going back towards the hole, but I'm not sure if that's a good approach.

I think a safer bet is to use 2 for states where movement away from the hole is needed and lower probabilities for others. Let me try [2:1:3:2]—params[0]=2, params[1]=1, etc.—this might balance exploration but also give some bias towards certain actions.

But I should test this by trying a few different parameter combinations to see what f(params) gives and how the agent responds. Maybe starting with [2:1:3:2] and adjusting based on experience would be better than just randomly guessing.
