You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me start by understanding the problem thoroughly.

The environment is a 4x4 grid with states numbered from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). The goal is state 15, which gives +1 reward. All other states give 0, except when stepping into a hole, which ends the episode.

The slippery nature of the environment means that each action leads to one of three possible directions with equal probability. So, for example, choosing action 0 (left) could result in down, left, or up, each with 1/3 chance.

Given that, I need to design a policy that maximizes the expected reward by avoiding holes and efficiently navigating towards state 15.

Looking at the provided top params, their rewards are around 0.35-0.45, which is below the target of 1.0. This suggests that we're not yet optimal. The trajectories show that agents often get stuck in loops or fall into holes.

To improve, I should consider how each state's policy choice affects the next states and whether they lead towards the goal or into danger.

Let me analyze key states:

- State 0 (top-left): It can move down to state 4 with action 0. But since it's slippery, choosing action 0 might send it elsewhere. Perhaps action 1 could help? Wait, no—action 1 from state 0 would have possible moves right, down, left. From state 0, moving right is better as it leads towards the goal.

Wait, but I need to map each action's possible next states for all states. This might get complicated, but let me try.

For example:

- State 0: actions can move to (down:4), (right:1), or (up: which isn't possible since we're at top, so maybe stays in 0? Or does it wrap around?) No, I think moving up from state 0 would stay in the same state. So action 0 has possible next states as down (4), left (stays 0?), and up (stays 0). Wait, no—the slippery effect makes each action have three possible directions with equal probability.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to create a transition matrix or at least understand the possible transitions for each state-action pair. But that might take too long manually. Instead, let me think about safe paths and high-reward areas.

Holes are present in some states. For instance, state 5 (which I believe is the hole on the second row, first column) leads to an immediate end if stepped into. So the policy must avoid actions that could lead there.

Looking at the previous params, it seems that many policies are getting stuck or falling into holes. To get closer to the goal, maybe we need a more direct path.

I think I should focus on states near the goal and ensure their policies guide towards 15 without risk. For example:

- State 14: right action leads to 15. So params[14] should be 0 (right) or maybe another action that doesn't lead away.

Wait, actually, let me think about each state's best possible action considering the slippery nature and avoiding holes.

Alternatively, perhaps using a value iteration approach would help, but since I'm supposed to propose policies without knowing the full environment details beyond what's provided, I'll have to make educated guesses based on previous attempts.

Looking at the top params, their f(params) is around 0.45, which is higher than the recent ones but still below optimal. Maybe tweaking these could help.

Perhaps changing some of the actions in states that are near the goal or on common paths might improve the reward.

For example, state 13: if it's set to move right (action 3), maybe that leads towards 15 more effectively.

Alternatively, perhaps adjusting state 7 to encourage moving down instead of another direction could help reach the goal faster.

I think a good strategy is to propose a policy that slightly modifies the best-performing ones but introduces some changes to explore new trajectories and avoid getting stuck in loops or holes.
