You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let's see, it's a 4x4 grid where the agent can move in four directions, but because of the slippery nature, each action leads to one of three possible moves with equal probability. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) and avoid holes which end the episode.

First, I need to understand how the policy parameters work. Each params[i] represents the action taken when in state i. Since there are 16 states, each from 0 to 15, each parameter is an integer between 0 and 3 corresponding to the four possible actions.

Looking at the trajectories provided, it seems that some policies get stuck or fall into holes. For example, one trajectory went (0,1) then (4,2), (8,2), which probably led to a hole since the reward was only 0.35. Another trajectory kept moving in the same direction and didn't reach the goal.

The top-performing policies had rewards around 0.35, but we need to get closer to 1.0, so there's room for improvement. The recent policies tried have lower rewards, indicating that maybe the current strategies aren't effective enough.

I should consider what actions lead towards the goal. Since state 15 is the target, I want the agent to move right and down as much as possible from earlier states. But because of the slippery nature, choosing the right action is tricky since each action has a 1/3 chance of moving in three directions.

I think about how each state can best approach the goal. For example, being in state 0 (top-left), moving right or down would be better. Similarly, states closer to the bottom-right should prioritize those movements.

But considering the slippery nature, maybe it's better to have a policy that encourages movement towards the goal while avoiding holes. I need to look at each state and decide which action has the highest probability of leading towards the goal without stepping on holes.

Looking at previous attempts, some states were taking actions that led into holes or kept looping in circles. So perhaps adjusting certain states' actions can help avoid those pitfalls.

I also notice that the recent policies have lower rewards, so maybe the agent is getting stuck or not making progress towards the goal. I should adjust the policy to encourage more direct paths and reduce chances of falling into holes.

For instance, state 0 could move right (action 1), which has a chance to go down, left, or up. But since moving right from 0 leads towards higher-numbered states, that might be better. Similarly, other states should have actions that generally push the agent towards state 15.

I need to map out each state and decide the best action for it. Let's consider:

- State 0: Moving right (action 1) could lead to states 1, 4, or staying in 0. But since moving right is better than other directions here.
- States near the bottom-right should move right or down as much as possible.

But I also have to remember that each action has three possible outcomes, so sometimes the agent might take a wrong path but still have a chance to correct it.

I think a policy where each state moves towards increasing its row and column indices would be optimal. For example:

- From state 0 (row 0, col 0), move right (action 1) to try to go to state 1.
- From state 3 (row 0, col 3), moving down is better as it can lead towards the goal.

But I'm not sure about all states. Maybe a more systematic approach would help. Each state's action should be chosen such that, on average, it moves closer to state 15.

I'll try to construct a policy where each state has an action that maximizes the expected progress towards the goal while avoiding known holes.

After considering these factors, I decide to set up the policy as follows:

- For states in the top row (0-3), prioritize moving right or down.
- For middle rows, move towards the bottom-right.
- Ensure that actions near the edges avoid falling into holes by choosing safer moves.

Based on this reasoning, I construct a new params array where each state's action is set to encourage movement towards the goal without leading into known dangerous areas. This should help increase the reward towards 1.0 in subsequent iterations.
