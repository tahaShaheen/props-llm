You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help optimize a policy for the FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get the highest possible reward by reaching state 15 without falling into any holes. From what I understand, the environment is slippery, meaning each action taken has a 33% chance of going in one of three directions. 

Looking at the parameters provided, it seems like all previous policies have been yielding around 0.10 to 0.15 average rewards, which are way below the target of 1.0. That suggests that we're not yet exploiting effectively because we haven't found a policy that can consistently reach the goal without falling into holes.

Since the current top-performing policies aren't close to the optimal reward, I should focus on exploration strategies. The key here is to try out new parameter configurations that have not been attempted before to gather more information about which actions lead towards the goal and which ones are risky.

I notice that in the most recent parameters, some states are being assigned specific actions, but they might not be leading directly towards the goal. For example, if state 0 is set to action 1 (right), it might move towards state 3, which could be a hole or not. Alternatively, setting state 0 to action 2 (up) might move towards state 4, which is in the second row.

I should consider what actions would guide the agent closer to state 15. From state 0 (top-left), moving right (action 1) could get the agent to state 3, and then possibly towards state 7 or further down. Alternatively, moving down (action 0) from state 0 leads to state 4.

Perhaps a better approach is to have each state's action guide towards either the right or down direction, depending on where the goal is. Since the goal is at the bottom-right (state 15), moving right and down should be prioritized. However, due to the slippery nature, the agent might not go directly in that direction every time.

I also need to ensure that the chosen actions don't lead the agent into holes. From previous trajectories, some states when taking certain actions end up falling into holes, so I should avoid those paths.

Let me think about each state:

- State 0: Should move right (action 1) or down (action 0). Let's try action 1 to go towards the right.
- State 1: Maybe moving down (action 0) could take it closer to the goal, but also there's a risk. Alternatively, moving right (action 1) might be better.
- State 2: Moving down (action 0) would take it to state 6, which is in the third row.
- And so on for each state.

But since I can't remember previous attempts, I need to choose actions that are likely to move towards the goal without getting stuck. Maybe setting most states to action 1 (right) and some to action 3 (left) depending on their position could help navigate around holes.

Alternatively, perhaps a more systematic approach is needed, but since I can't plan ahead, I have to make educated guesses based on general movement towards the goal.

Given that all previous attempts are yielding low rewards, I think it's best to try a new set of parameters where each state is assigned an action that would generally move towards the right or down. For example:

- States in the top row (0-3): move right.
- States in the first column (0,4,8,12): move down.

This way, from any position not on the bottom row, moving down progresses towards the goal, and moving right progresses along the row.

So, let's assign:

- For states 0,1,2: action 1 (right)
- For state 3: action 0 (down) to go to state 7
- Similarly, for other states not in the last column, move right; if in the last column, move down.

But I need to ensure that this doesn't cause the agent to fall into holes. Since I don't know where the holes are exactly, I have to rely on trial and error.

Let me draft a possible set of parameters based on this logic:

params[0]:1, params[1]:1, params[2]:1, params[3]:0,
params[4]:2, params[5]:2, params[6]:2, params[7]:1,
params[8]:3, params[9]:3, params[10]:3, params[11]:2,
params[12]:0, params[13]:0, params[14]:0, params[15]:3.

This configuration moves the agent right in the top row except for state 3 which goes down. In the second row, it prefers moving right or up/down as needed. 

Wait, but I might be overcomplicating it. Since the environment is slippery, perhaps a more cautious approach where each state has an action that tries to move towards the goal without immediate risk.

Another idea: set all states except those near the goal to move down or right, depending on their position relative to the center. Alternatively, have states in even columns move right and odd columns move down.

But since I can't remember previous policies, I need to propose a new one that's different from what's been tried before.

Looking at the top 8 params, many have alternating actions between 1 and 3 or similar patterns. So perhaps changing this up by having more consistent movement towards the goal could help.

I think I'll set most states to action 2 (up), but that might not be helpful. Alternatively, maybe setting all states except those in the last row to move down, and those in the last column to move right. But since the agent can't remember, it's hard to plan precise paths.

Given all this, I'll propose a new set of parameters where each state tries to move towards the goal as much as possible without repeating previous configurations.
