You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

Do NOT output anything else. No explanation, no reasoning, nothing.



LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy parameters for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15, which gives a reward of +1, and avoid the holes that end the episode with zero reward.

First, I need to understand how the environment works. It's a 4x4 grid, so states are from 0 to 15. Each action has three possible outcomes because it's slippery. For example, moving left could take you down, up, or stay in place, each with equal probability.

Looking at the recent parameters and their rewards, most of them have low rewards around 0.35 or less. The best so far is 0.45, which is still below the target of 1.0. This suggests that we're not yet reaching the goal consistently.

In the most recent iterations, policies are getting stuck or falling into holes. For instance, one trajectory went from (0,3) to (1,3), then looped around and eventually fell into a hole. Another got stuck in a cycle without making progress towards the goal.

I think the key is to design a policy that avoids known holes and navigates towards state 15 efficiently. Since the agent's movement is probabilistic, the policy needs to choose actions that maximize the chance of moving towards the goal while minimizing the risk of falling into holes.

From the top-performing policies, they tend to move right or down more often from certain states. Maybe adjusting these to encourage a more direct path towards state 15 would help. Also, ensuring that each state's action choice doesn't lead to known dangerous areas is crucial.

I should consider making states closer to the goal (like states 12-15) have actions that directly move towards 15. For example, state 14 should probably always try to move right or up if possible. Similarly, earlier states like 0 might benefit from moving down or right to progress towards the goal.

Another approach is to look for policies that avoid getting stuck in cycles. If a policy leads the agent into repeating states without making progress, it's not useful. So I should choose actions that have a higher chance of moving forward rather than staying in place or moving away.

Given that previous attempts haven't reached 1.0 reward, perhaps we need to tweak certain states' actions to push more towards the goal. For example, state 4 (top-left of the second row) might benefit from moving down instead of right if it's risky. Similarly, state 8 (top-left of third row) should probably move down or right.

I also notice that some policies get stuck in the upper rows because their actions don't lead them towards the goal efficiently. Maybe adjusting these to take more downward movements would help navigate towards the bottom-right corner.

In summary, I need to adjust the policy parameters so that each state's action choice is aimed at moving closer to state 15 while avoiding holes. This might involve setting certain states to always move down or right and ensuring that other actions don't lead into dangerous areas.
