You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

Do NOT output anything else. No explanation, no reasoning, nothing.



LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with the highest possible reward, and all other states give zero except when you fall into a hole, which ends the episode.

First, I need to understand how the environment works. It's a 4x4 grid, slippery, so actions have three possible outcomes each with equal probability. The agent can move in different directions depending on the action taken. For example, action 0 leads to moving down, left, or up. Each action has its own set of possible moves.

The policy is an array of 16 numbers, each representing the action for states 0 to 15. I need to choose these actions such that the agent avoids holes and reaches state 15 as often as possible.

Looking at the provided examples and trajectories, it seems like some policies aren't effective because they get stuck in loops or fall into holes. For instance, a policy that keeps moving right (action 0) might end up cycling between states without reaching the goal or falling into a hole.

Since the optimal reward should be around 1.0, which means the agent successfully reaches state 15 at least once in an episode, I need to find a policy that almost always achieves this.

In the most recent iterations, some policies are getting low rewards (like 0.10 or 0.25), which suggests they're not consistently reaching the goal. To improve, maybe I should focus on ensuring that each state leads towards state 15 without leading into holes.

I also notice that in the top-performing params, action 3 is frequently used for certain states, which might help in navigating around holes by moving up or right more often. But since it's slippery, the agent can't rely solely on one direction; it needs to have a mix of actions to increase the chances of reaching the goal without falling into traps.

Perhaps I should adjust some of the policies to encourage movement towards state 15 while also ensuring that they don't get stuck in cycles or near holes. For example, states closer to the bottom-right (like 12, 13, 14) should probably take actions that move right or down to reach state 15.

Looking at the recent attempts, some params have high values (like action 3), which might be causing the agent to go in circles. Maybe switching some of these to lower actions could help them move towards the goal instead.

I need to propose a new set of params that's different from previous ones and maximizes the chance of reaching state 15 while avoiding holes. Since I'm supposed to act as an explorer now (since rewards are below 1.0), I'll try changing several parameters significantly to gather more information on how they perform.
