You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to find the best policy for this FrozenLake environment that's being explored through trajectories. The agent is in a 4x4 grid, and each state can transition to certain neighboring states based on the actions taken. Each action has equal probability except when specified otherwise.

First, looking at the provided parameters, they're an array of size 16 where each index corresponds to a specific state. The goal is to reach state 15, which is the bottom right corner. The values in the params array represent the action indices: 0 for down, 1 for right or left (wait, no—actually, let me clarify). Wait, according to the problem description, each parameter represents an action when on a specific state.

Looking at the top-performing example given:

params[0]: 2, params[1]: 0, params[2]:3, params[3]:2, and so on. This policy seems deterministic, moving left from state 0, down to state 4 (but wait, maybe I'm mixing up indices), or perhaps it's a mix based on the parameters.

But since all the top-performing examples have similar patterns—like right moves being avoided except when necessary—they probably favor exploring without falling into holes. So the optimal policy would avoid states that are dangerous with holes (i.e., not allowing stepping onto them) and try to reach the goal quickly.

I think a good strategy is to move towards the hole whenever possible, but I need to ensure that state 15 is always accessible. Each time the agent steps on a hole, it gets penalized, so the policy should avoid it as much as possible.

Maybe using a deterministic approach where each action leads directly to the goal if possible would work. For example, at some states, moving down or right might be better, but we need to ensure that we don't fall into a hole and that we reach 15 quickly.

Alternatively, a randomized policy could explore different paths, which might help avoid getting stuck in local optima. But since the parameters are limited to 0-3, maybe there's a more effective deterministic approach.

I also remember reading that in some cases, using action elimination or other methods can lead to better policies, but given the constraints on params, I'll stick with choosing actions based on the current state and avoiding holes.

So, for each state, if moving down, right, or up is possible without stepping on a hole, choose them randomly. If only certain moves are allowed due to surrounding states, prioritize those that lead towards 15.
