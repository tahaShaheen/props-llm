You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out the best policy parameters for the FrozenLake environment based on the information given. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward by reaching state 15 without falling into any holes.

First, I need to understand the environment setup. It's a 4x4 grid where each cell represents a state from 0 to 15. The agent can move in four directions, but due to the slippery nature, each action has a 33% chance of moving in three possible directions. Holes are present, and stepping on them ends the episode.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 actions (params), where each element corresponds to the action taken from that state. The challenge is to choose these actions such that the agent reaches the goal (state 15) with as high a probability as possible while avoiding holes.

Looking at the provided examples, all top-performing policies have f(params) around 0.10-0.15, which is far below the target of 1.0. This suggests we need to explore more rather than exploit current suboptimal strategies.

The trajectories show that many policies get stuck in loops or fall into holes quickly. For instance, some trajectories end after a few steps due to falling into holes, indicating that the current policies are not effectively navigating around them.

Since the goal is state 15 (bottom right), I should ensure that states leading towards it have actions that guide the agent right and down when possible. However, because of the slippery nature, direct paths might not work as intended.

I need to consider each state's position and determine which action increases the chances of moving towards the goal while minimizing hole risks. For example:
- States near the edges should avoid actions leading outside or into holes.
- Middle states may need a mix of right/down moves with some flexibility due to the slippery effect.

Looking at previous policies, many have params[15] set to 3 (right action), but since state 15 is the goal, staying there is optimal. So, setting params[15] = 3 might be good if it keeps the agent in place or moves towards the goal, but actually, once at 15, any action doesn't matter as it's terminal.

I should also consider that each action from a state has three possible outcomes. Thus, the policy must account for all possible transitions without leading into holes.

To explore effectively, I can try setting different actions for states near known holes or in areas where previous policies have failed. For example, if certain states frequently lead to holes, adjusting their actions might prevent that.

I'm thinking of creating a grid-based approach where each state's action is chosen based on its position relative to the goal and avoiding holes. This would involve mapping out safe paths and ensuring that each state's action contributes to moving towards the goal without risk.

Since I can't remember previous attempts, each iteration should focus on maximizing information gain by testing new configurations. This might mean changing multiple parameters at once to see how they affect the trajectory and reward.

Finally, considering the most recent policies with low rewards, I need to make significant changes rather than tweaking existing ones. Perhaps setting more aggressive right and down actions where possible, while ensuring that other directions are chosen when near holes or edges.
