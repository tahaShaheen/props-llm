You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The problem statement mentions that the environment is slippery, which means each action has an equal probability of leading to three possible states. My goal is to find a policy that maximizes the reward.

First, I need to understand how the policy works. A policy in reinforcement learning is a strategy that determines the action to take for each state. Here, the policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers where each number corresponds to the probability of taking a specific action from a state. Since the actions are left (0), right (1), up (2), and down (3), each parameter in the array represents the chance of choosing that action when the agent is at state i.

The global optimal policy should ideally avoid any holes in the map, which means exploring until it can safely step on these holes. Since I don't know where the holes are beforehand, my exploration must be adaptive based on how the current policy performs after each iteration.

Looking at the provided examples, some parameters result in higher rewards (like 0.15 or 0.20), which might indicate good policies. However, others have lower rewards (like 0.05). My task is to find a set of parameters that consistently leads to high rewards without falling into any holes.

I should consider the structure of the FrozenLake environment. The grid has four states per row and columns, and certain paths lead to falling into holes. I need to plan actions that avoid these traps by exploring surrounding areas thoroughly.

Since all action probabilities are set initially to 0.25 for each (as seen in the parameters), it's likely not optimal. I need to adjust these values based on how exploration affects rewards and whether certain actions lead to immediate rewards versus longer-term gains.

The agent should balance between exploiting known good paths and exploring unexplored areas when the current policy doesn't suggest any clear advantage. This could mean increasing the probabilities of certain actions in states where they yield higher immediate rewards or avoiding those that lead to immediate penalties.

I also need to ensure that I'm not getting stuck on holes, so my exploration should focus on safe paths around them. Since the environment is slippery, all movements have a 1/3 chance, making it harder to rely purely on known states.

Perhaps starting with more balanced probabilities and gradually increasing certain actions based on how the policy performs after each iteration could lead towards an optimal solution. It's important not to over-explorate without considering immediate benefits, but also not under-exploring if better policies exist.

I should consider using techniques like Q-learning or SARSA with discount factors adjusted according to the slippery environment. But since we're given specific parameter ranges and need a single set of values, I'll focus on finding a stable policy that's effective across various states without getting stuck in local optima.

In conclusion, the optimal parameters likely involve a strategic distribution of action probabilities that avoids immediate penalties while maximizing long-term rewards, especially around hole states. I might start by exploring how balancing actions affects each state and gradually experiment with increasing certain probabilities if they yield higher rewards.
