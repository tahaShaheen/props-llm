You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get from any starting position to state 15 (the bottom right) while avoiding holes. The tricky part is that each action has a 33% chance of moving in one of three directions due to the slippery nature of the grid.

Looking at the top 5 best performing params, I notice that most of them have f(params) around 0.25-0.35, which is lower than the target of 1.0. This suggests that none of these policies are consistently reaching the goal yet. The trajectories provided show that some policies get stuck in loops or fall into holes quickly.

The recent params seem to be worse, with rewards as low as 0. So maybe we need a different approach. Since I'm supposed to act as an optimizer now because the rewards aren't too close to 1.0 yet, but they are somewhat low, perhaps I should try exploring more varied policies.

I see that some of the recent params have actions that keep moving in the same direction or might be leading into holes. For example, a policy with all action 3s (except state 15) would probably keep moving right and down randomly but might end up in a hole.

So I need to find a balance between exploring new paths and tweaking existing policies slightly. Maybe setting some states to move directly towards the goal more effectively. Since each action has three possible outcomes, it's hard to control the exact path, but we can increase the chances of moving towards state 15.

Let me think about state 0 (top-left corner). The optimal action here would be to try to move right or down, but since both have a 33% chance each, perhaps choosing an action that covers both possibilities. Action 1 for state 0 could help because it allows moving right, down, or left. But if the agent is at (0,0), moving left isn't possible, so maybe it's better to choose actions that push towards the right and down.

Alternatively, looking at the previous best params, some have action 2 for state 0, which gives a mix of up, right, and down. That might help in avoiding immediate falls while progressing towards the goal.

I should also consider states closer to the goal. For example, state 14 (third row, third column) is just one step away from the goal if it moves right or down. So for state 14, setting action 3 could allow moving up, right, or down, which gives a higher chance of reaching the goal.

Another approach is to ensure that near the edges and corners, the actions don't lead into holes. For example, state 3 (top-right) should avoid moving right if there's a hole there. Similarly, states in the bottom row should focus on moving right towards state 15.

I think I'll try creating a policy where each state is set to an action that has the highest probability of moving towards the goal without immediately stepping into a hole. For instance:

- States near the goal (like 12, 13, 14, 15) should be set to actions that push towards right or down.
- Middle states might benefit from a mix of actions to explore different paths.

But since I don't have information about where the holes are exactly, I need to assume they're in certain positions. From the trajectories, it seems like some policies get stuck at state 8 (third row, first column), so maybe that's a hole or leads into one.

To avoid getting stuck, I'll set states near the edges and corners to actions that encourage movement towards the center or the goal while reducing the risk of falling into holes. For example:

- State 0: action 2 (up, right, down) might help move towards the right or down.
- States in the top row should have actions that push downward.
- Middle states can alternate between right and down to approach the goal.

I'll also try varying some of the recent policies slightly by changing a few state's actions to see if it improves the reward. For example, adjusting the action for state 12 from 3 to 0 or something else might help avoid certain paths that lead into holes.

Overall, I need to create a policy that balances exploration and exploitation, ensuring that the agent has a higher chance of reaching the goal without falling into holes by carefully selecting actions that cover multiple directions towards the target.
