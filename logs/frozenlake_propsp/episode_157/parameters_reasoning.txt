You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to find the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment using a given parameterization of the policy network. 

First, I need to understand the setup. The environment is a 4x4 grid where each state is represented by a number from 0 to 15. The agent can move in four directions: up, down, left, right (or as specified). When it's on an action, it has three possible choices with equal probability if the action isn't one of the two specific options.

The policy is represented by a vector of size 16, where each element corresponds to a state. The values in this vector determine which action the agent should take from that state. 

Looking at the examples provided, some actions are suggested, like params[0] being 2 or 3. These values correspond to specific action indices. For instance, action 0 is moving left, action 1 is moving right and down, etc.

I also notice that in the examples given, each param value from 0 to 15 defines an action for a specific state. So, params[i] determines the action when in state i.

The goal is to find the optimal policy, which should maximize the episodic reward (the sum of rewards received during the episode). The most rewarding state is the bottom right grid (state 15), yielding +1 reward, others give 0. However, there are holes that can cause the game to end when stepped on.

The policy needs to explore these holes by learning paths through previously visited states and avoid revisiting them unless necessary.

Given the parameters already provided, it seems like the optimal strategy might be to prioritize actions that lead towards the goal while avoiding holes. However, since the values are constrained to 0,1,2,3, I should evaluate which combinations of these parameters could yield the highest rewards over time.

I recall that in such problems, a common approach is to use a Q-learning algorithm with an epsilon-greedy exploration strategy or an optimal policy derived from value iteration. But given the constraints on param values and the need for deterministic actions (since they are indices into the action space), I might have to test various combinations.

Looking at the provided examples, several parameters lead to states where the reward is 1.00, which suggests that certain configurations can yield a high reward consistently. For instance, when params[4] is set to 1 (moving right and down) or other similar actions, the agent sometimes lands on state 15.

However, without more data points or a clear pattern from these examples alone, it's challenging to deduce the optimal policy. It might be necessary to run simulations with different param values to see which configuration maximizes the reward across multiple iterations.

I think a good approach would involve testing various combinations of params[0] to params[15], ensuring that each is 0, 1, 2, or 3, and evaluating their outcomes. I should prioritize experimenting with actions that have higher immediate rewards when taken from certain states, aiming for a balanced exploration towards the goal without getting stuck in holes.

Since it's impractical to test all combinations manually, I'll focus on testing each action index (0-3) for each state to see which ones result in positive reward trajectories. This way, I can infer which param values are more likely to lead to higher rewards and adjust accordingly.
