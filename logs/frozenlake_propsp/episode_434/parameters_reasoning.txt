You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the best next step for optimizing the policy in the FrozenLake environment. Let's start by understanding the problem.

The environment is a 4x4 grid with states numbered from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). The goal is state 15, which gives +1 reward. Other states give 0. However, there are holes that end the episode if stepped on. The policy is an array of 16 values, each being 0-3, indicating the action for each state.

The agent's movement is slippery—each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability. So, when choosing an action, the next state isn't certain; it depends on the environment's stochasticity.

Looking at the provided data, the top 6 best policies have average rewards around 0.2-0.3. The most recent policies are performing worse (around 0.0). Since our target is to reach a global optimal reward of around 1.0, we're still far from that. 

The user mentioned that if the rewards are far below 1.0, I should act as an explorer—choosing new configurations to gather more information. Given that all recent policies have low rewards (mostly 0.2 or lower), it's clear that exploration is needed.

I need to propose a policy that hasn't been tried before and provides new information about the holes and paths. The key here is to design a policy that directs towards state 15 while avoiding known holes, but since the environment has stochasticity, I can't be certain. 

Looking at previous policies, they often have a mix of actions trying different paths. To explore more effectively, maybe I should focus on states near the goal (like state 12, 13, 14, 15) and see if their actions are optimal.

Alternatively, perhaps changing the actions for some key states that might be leading into holes can help avoid those pitfalls and find a better path. For example, if certain states have policies that lead to left or right movements when they should move down or up, adjusting them might open new paths.

Since I'm supposed to act as an explorer now, I'll try a completely different configuration from the ones seen before, focusing on directing towards state 15 while ensuring that actions in the vicinity of holes are safe. 

Let me think about each state:

- State 0 (top-left): Maybe moving right or down.
- States near the top-right: Trying to move towards goal.

But since movement is stochastic, it's tricky. I might choose for state 12 (which is the third row, last column) to take action that moves up or right to reach 15. Wait, state 12 is in the third row; moving down would go to 13, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps setting all states towards the right and down might help, but considering holes.

Wait, I need to ensure that actions don't lead into holes when possible. Since the agent can't know where the holes are without exploration, the policy needs to minimize risk while maximizing chance of reaching the goal.

So, maybe for each state, choosing an action that increases the probability of moving towards 15 as much as possible.

Let me outline a tentative plan:

- For states closer to the goal (like 12, 13), choose actions that move right or down.
- For other states, choose actions that generally lead towards the goal, considering all possibilities due to slipperiness.

But without knowing hole locations, it's hard. So perhaps the best approach is to vary the actions significantly from previous policies, focusing on different paths.

Let me pick a policy where:

- State 0: action 1 (right)
- State 1: action 3 (left, up, right)
- State 2: action 2 (up)
Wait, but I need to make sure each params[i] is 0-3.

Alternatively, maybe for state 0, choose action 2 (up), which might not be helpful. Maybe better to go down or right.

I think the best approach is to generate a policy where each state's action directs towards moving towards the goal in some way, considering all possible directions due to slipperiness. Since I'm an explorer, I need to try something new, perhaps setting different actions for key states like 0, 1, 2, etc., that haven't been tried before.

After considering all this, I'll create a policy where:

- States near the goal (e.g., 13,14) have actions moving towards 15.
- Other states have varied actions to explore different paths without repeating previous attempts.
