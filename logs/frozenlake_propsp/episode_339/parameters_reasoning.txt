You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, let me try to figure out the best approach here. The user is working on a FrozenLake environment where the agent moves in a 4x4 grid, and there are holes that can end the episode if stepped on. The goal is to reach state 15 for a reward of +1, with all other states giving 0.

The challenge is to find the optimal policy by adjusting parameters (params) which map each state to an action (0-3). The environment is slippery, so actions can lead to different states with equal probability. The user has provided some top-performing params and their corresponding rewards, along with recent trajectories. 

Looking at the most recent data, the best reward achieved is 0.25, which is quite low compared to the target of around 1.0. This suggests that the current policies aren't effectively navigating towards the goal without falling into holes.

I notice that in the recent trials, the agent often gets stuck or falls into loops. For example, one trajectory shows repeated moves from state 0 and 4 without progressing towards the goal. Another example has the agent moving to state 8,3 but then not making progress.

To improve, I should focus on designing a policy that directs the agent towards the goal while avoiding holes. Since the environment is slippery, each action choice must account for the possible directions the agent might move. 

One idea is to have states closer to the goal (like state 12, 13, 14) choose actions that directly aim towards state 15. For instance, state 12 should move right or down if possible, but considering the slippery nature, it's better to choose an action that increases the chances of moving towards 15.

Looking at previous attempts, some policies have all states choosing action 1, which might not be optimal as it doesn't target the goal effectively. Instead, a more adaptive policy where each state has a specific action based on its position could help.

I should also consider avoiding actions that lead to known hole positions. For example, certain states near the edges or in the middle might have higher risks of falling into holes if not navigated properly.

Given that the current rewards are low, I think it's best to take an exploratory approach rather than optimizing existing policies since they aren't close to the target reward. So, I'll propose a new set of params where each state is assigned an action that directs towards the goal while considering possible slippery outcomes.
