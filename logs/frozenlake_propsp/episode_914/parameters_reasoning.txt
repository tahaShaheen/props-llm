You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out the best way to propose a new set of parameters for the FrozenLake environment based on the given information. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward by reaching state 15 without falling into any holes. 

First, I need to understand the environment structure. It's a 4x4 grid where each state corresponds to a position from 0 to 15. The agent can move in four directions, but due to the slippery nature of the ice, each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability. This means that choosing an action doesn't guarantee moving in the intended direction; instead, there's a chance it could go left, right, up, or down depending on the action selected.

The rewards are +1 for reaching state 15 and 0 otherwise. There are also holes which end the episode if stepped on. The challenge is to design a policy that navigates safely to the goal while avoiding these holes.

Looking at the provided examples, most of the policies have average rewards around 0.35 or lower. This suggests that the current strategies aren't very effective, and there's room for improvement. The top-performing params had an average reward of 0.45, which is still below the target of 1.0.

Since I'm supposed to act as a stateless optimizer, I need to focus on maximizing information gain each iteration without remembering past attempts. My approach should be to explore new parameter configurations that haven't been tried before if the rewards are significantly below 1.0, and then start optimizing once closer to the target.

In this case, since the current best is around 0.45, which is still quite low, I should continue exploring different strategies rather than tweaking existing ones. The goal is to find a policy that can consistently reach state 15 with high probability while avoiding holes.

I need to propose a new set of params where each element is from [0,1,2,3], ensuring it's distinct from previously seen configurations. I should consider how each action choice in different states affects the overall path towards the goal.

For example, in state 0 (top-left corner), choosing an action that has a higher probability of moving right or down might be beneficial since those directions lead closer to the goal. However, due to the slippery nature, these actions don't guarantee movement in that direction, so I need to account for all possible outcomes.

Additionally, I should consider how each state's policy affects subsequent states. For instance, if a certain action from state 0 leads the agent to a hole with some probability, it might be better to choose an action that avoids such risks, even if it doesn't move directly towards the goal.

I also notice that in previous attempts, some trajectories end quickly by falling into holes or not making progress. To improve, I should design policies that allow the agent to explore multiple paths, increasing the chances of avoiding hazards and reaching the goal.

One strategy could be to have each state's action choice spread out the possible movements so that even with the slippery effect, the agent has a higher chance of eventually reaching the goal without getting stuck in loops or falling into holes.

Given all this, I'll propose a new set of parameters where each state is assigned an action that balances moving towards the goal while considering potential risks. This might involve selecting actions that have varied movement options to maximize exploration and minimize the chances of hitting a hole.
