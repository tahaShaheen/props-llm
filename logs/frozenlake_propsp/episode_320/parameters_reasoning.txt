You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help the agent find the global optimal policy in the FrozenLake environment using a policy optimizer. The environment is a 4x4 grid where each state is numbered from 0 to 15. When an action is taken, the agent has equal probability of choosing one of three directions if it's not the slippery option.

First, I need to understand how the policy works. The policy is a function that maps states (0-15) to actions (0-3). Each state represents a grid position, so state 0 is top-left, and state 15 is bottom-right. The goal is to reach state 15 with the highest reward.

The parameters of the optimizer are an array where each parameter corresponds to an action when on a specific state. For example, params[0] is the action for state 0, params[1] for state 1, and so on until params[15] for state 15. Each param can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.

The agent should explore through previously seen trajectories to avoid getting stuck in local optima. So, I need a strategy that doesn't just rely on random exploration but actively explores the environment while exploiting known good actions.

Looking at the provided examples, it seems like there are several params arrays being used. The top performing ones have certain patterns. For instance, some params set action 1 (right) except for states where other actions might lead to better outcomes. Others sometimes take action 2 or 3 when on certain states, which suggests a mix of exploration and exploitation.

I should aim for an approach that balances these two. Perhaps using epsilon-greedy could help—randomizing between the best-known action and exploring other options. But I have to make sure that if all known actions are worse than some unknown ones, it still explores enough to find better paths.

Looking at the examples given in the top results, a lot of them involve taking action 1 (right) almost every time except when on certain states. For example, params[0] is set to 2 often but sometimes switches to 1 if necessary. This suggests that for some states, taking the right action might lead to higher rewards.

I think a good strategy would be to always take the best-known action, which I can determine by evaluating the current policy's performance. However, since we don't have an evaluator yet, maybe we can assume that when an action is taken, it has a certain probability of success based on its value. 

Wait, the problem statement says each action is chosen with equal probability for non-slippery moves. So, if the agent knows which action leads to higher rewards, perhaps I should always choose that action. But how do I know when an action is better than others? Without evaluating, it's challenging.

Maybe a better approach is to use a strategy where for each state, the best action (highest reward) is taken, but sometimes explore other actions slightly if they have lower rewards but could lead to higher ones in the future. This way, the agent can exploit known good paths while exploring other possibilities to find even better routes.

I should also consider that all states start at 0, so perhaps I'll need a function to evaluate which action gives the best reward for each state. Once I have that, I can always take the corresponding action for exploitation and sometimes explore others with equal or higher probability.

Alternatively, since all actions are equally likely in non-slippery steps, maybe it's better to focus on states where known actions might not be optimal, encouraging exploration there.

I think a possible approach is to always choose the best-known action when available but occasionally switch to other actions (maybe using a small epsilon) if they have lower rewards. This way, the agent can exploit known good paths while exploring less likely ones in case of conflicts or when all options are equally good.

So, I'll need to implement this strategy: for each state, determine the best action based on current knowledge. If that action leads to higher rewards, always take it. Otherwise, sometimes explore other actions by random selection with a certain probability (epsilon) while keeping others known for exploitation.

I should also consider initializing the optimizer's parameters in a way that allows it to start balancing exploration and exploitation without favoring any single action too early. Maybe setting all params to 1 initially as a starting point for exploration.

Wait, the user provided some examples whereparams[0] is set to 2 often but sometimes varies. This suggests that in certain states, taking action 1 (right) might be better, while others prefer other actions. It seems like a mix of exploitation and exploration is key here.

Maybe I should implement an epsilon-greedy approach with a fixed epsilon, say 0.1, where 10% of the time random actions are taken. This way, the agent doesn't get too stuck on one set of known actions but still explores other options. However, this might not always be optimal.

Alternatively, I can use a Boltzmann exploration where the probability of choosing an action decreases as it's less explored. But without knowing how rewards are valued, it's hard to apply that directly.

Given all these considerations, perhaps the best approach is to for each state, select the action with the highest known reward and sometimes randomly choose other actions with a certain probability if they have lower rewards but might lead to better paths in the future.
