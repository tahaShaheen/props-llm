You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. So, from what I understand, it's a 4x4 grid where each state corresponds to a number from 0 to 15. The agent can move in four directions, but because the environment is slippery, each action has a 33% chance of moving in one of three possible directions instead of directly as intended.

The goal is to reach state 15, which gives a reward of +1, and avoid the holes that end the episode. The policy is defined by an array of 16 actions (each being 0-3) where each index corresponds to the action taken from that state.

Looking at the top 5 best-performing params provided, they all have f(params) around 0.35-0.45. This suggests that none are performing particularly well yet, so I'm probably in an exploration phase rather than exploitation. The recent 5 policies show lower rewards, with some even getting zero, which might mean those policies are leading the agent into holes or not reaching the goal.

The key here is to design a policy that avoids holes and navigates towards state 15 efficiently. Since the environment is slippery, it's crucial for each state to choose actions that have a high probability of moving closer to the goal while minimizing the chance of falling into a hole.

I need to consider each state and determine which action would give the best chance of reaching the goal without stepping on holes. For example, in the starting states (0-3), choosing an action that generally moves right or down might be beneficial, but I have to account for the slipperiness.

Let me break it down by states:

- **States near the bottom-right (like 12-15):** They should choose actions that move towards 15. For state 14, moving right is ideal, and from 13, moving down might be better depending on where the holes are.

- **Middle states:** States like 7,8, etc., need to balance between moving towards the goal and avoiding potential holes. For instance, if a hole is in a certain direction, the policy should choose an action that has a higher probability of avoiding it.

But since I don't have information about where the holes are exactly, I'll assume they're placed in standard FrozenLake positions, which typically include states like 5, 6, 12, and 13 as holes. Wait, no—wait, in the original FrozenLake, holes are at (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), etc., but I might be misremembering.

Wait, looking back, the user said that when the agent takes an action from state i, it has a 33% chance of moving down, left, or up for action 0; right, down, left for action 1; up, right, down for action 2; and left, up, right for action 3.

So each action leads to three possible next states with equal probability. Therefore, the policy must choose actions that maximize the expected reward, considering both the possibility of reaching the goal (state 15) and avoiding holes.

Given that the average reward is around 0.35-0.45, which is lower than the target of 1.0, I should aim for policies that can reach the goal more efficiently.

Looking at the recent attempts, some have trajectories where the agent gets stuck in loops or falls into holes quickly. For example, the most recent param had a trajectory leading to state 6 and then to a hole.

So, perhaps a better strategy is to design a policy that encourages movement towards the goal without getting trapped. Maybe prioritizing right and down movements when possible.

But since each action leads to three possible moves, choosing actions that have the highest chance of moving in the desired direction while avoiding holes.

Let me try to construct a policy:

- **State 0 (top-left):** Choosing action 1 (right, down, left). Moving right is the main goal, but considering slipperiness, it can also go down or left. However, moving down from state 0 would take it to state 4, which is the second row's first column.

- **State 1 (top-middle):** Action 3 could be better because it allows up, left, right movements. But since we're in the top row, up isn't possible, so right might lead towards the goal.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should use a more systematic approach. Perhaps using value iteration or considering each state's optimal action based on its position relative to the goal and holes.

Alternatively, looking at the current best params: they have a mix of actions that seem to prioritize moving right and down when possible, but perhaps not enough. The average reward isn't high enough yet, so maybe more aggressive movement towards the goal is needed.

Another consideration is that in slippery environments, sometimes it's better to take an action that has a higher probability of eventually reaching the goal even if it's not direct. For example, choosing actions that have multiple paths leading towards the goal could be beneficial due to the probabilistic nature.

Given all this, I think I should propose a policy where each state chooses the action that maximizes the chance of moving right or down, depending on its position, while avoiding known holes if possible.

But without knowing the exact hole positions, it's challenging. However, based on standard FrozenLake setups, holes are typically in certain states, so perhaps I can make educated guesses about which actions to take.

Wait, looking back at the provided trajectories:

- The first param had a trajectory (0,3) leading to state 1, then action 2 leading to state 2. Hmm, not sure.

But given that all current policies have lower rewards, maybe I need to try more varied actions to explore different paths.

Alternatively, perhaps focusing on states near the goal and ensuring they have optimal actions could help.

For example:

- State 14 (second-to-last row, third column): action should be right to reach 15.
- State 13: action down might lead directly to 15, but considering slipperiness, it's better to choose an action that has a higher chance of moving towards the goal.

But since each action leads to three possible moves, choosing an action with more favorable next states is key.

Alternatively, perhaps setting all states in the bottom row (states 12-15) to action 3 might help them move right or up or left. But I need to ensure that state 15's action doesn't matter since it's the goal.

Wait, no, once the agent reaches state 15, the episode ends with a reward of +1, so it doesn't take any more actions.

Given all this complexity, perhaps for iteration 1099, I should propose a policy that varies the actions to explore different paths and maximize information gain. Since the average is still low, maybe exploring new configurations would help.

So, I'll create a params array where each state chooses an action that could potentially move it towards the goal but also varies enough from previous attempts to gather more data.

For example:

- Even states might choose action 0 or 2 (which involve moving down/left/up or up/right/down), while odd states choose actions that prioritize right and down.

Alternatively, maybe assign each state an action that cycles through possible directions to see which leads to better rewards.

But without knowing the hole positions, it's tricky. Perhaps I should look for a policy where from each state, at least one of the three possible moves leads towards the goal without falling into a hole.

Given that the current best policies have f(params) around 0.45, maybe trying to tweak those slightly could help push the reward higher.

Alternatively, perhaps choosing actions that increase entropy (more varied movement options) could lead to discovering new paths that avoid holes and reach the goal more efficiently.

In summary, I'll propose a new params configuration where each state's action is chosen to maximize the potential towards the goal while varying enough from previous attempts to gather new information.
