You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

Do NOT output anything else. No explanation, no reasoning, nothing.



LLM:
<think>
Alright, let me try to figure this out step by step. So, I'm trying to help optimize the policy for the FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get the agent from the starting position (state 0) to state 15 with as much reward as possible. Since the environment is slippery and there are holes, the agent's actions need to be carefully chosen to avoid falling into any holes while trying to reach the goal.

First, I remember that in this setup, each action taken by the agent doesn't always result in the intended move because of the slipperiness. For example, if the agent chooses to move right (action 1), it actually has an equal chance to move down, left, or right. This makes the environment stochastic, so the policy needs to account for all possible outcomes.

Looking at the provided top-performing params, I see that some configurations are yielding around 0.35 reward on average. That's not too bad, but we want to get closer to 1.0. The recent params have shown some trajectories where the agent either gets stuck in a loop or falls into holes quickly.

Since I'm supposed to act as an optimizer now (because rewards are below 1.0), I should tweak the best-performing policies slightly to see if they can reach higher rewards. However, without memory of previous attempts, I have to base my decision solely on the information provided in the buffer.

I notice that some states near the goal might be getting risky actions. For example, state 15 is the goal, but maybe other states around it are being treated with certain actions that could lead to falling into a hole. Alternatively, perhaps the agent isn't taking enough steps towards the right direction because of the stochasticity.

I should focus on ensuring that each state leads the agent closer to the goal without putting it at risk. Maybe I need to adjust certain states' actions to have a higher probability of moving in the desired direction while avoiding holes.

Looking at the recent params, one had all actions set to 3 except some which led to lower rewards. Another had varying actions but still didn't reach the goal. Perhaps changing the action for state 0 from 1 to another option could help. Alternatively, adjusting the actions for states near the edges might prevent falling into holes.

I also need to ensure that each action in the params array is chosen from [0,1,2,3]. So I'll think about what each action does and how it affects the next state probabilities.

For instance, if a state is on the edge (like state 3), moving left might lead to a hole. So, in such cases, the policy should avoid actions that have a high chance of leading left without knowing for sure if it's safe.

Given all this, I'll try to propose a new set of params where key states near the goal or edges are adjusted to safer actions with higher chances of moving towards the goal and avoiding holes.
