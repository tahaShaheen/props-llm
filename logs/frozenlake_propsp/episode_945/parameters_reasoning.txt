You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment based on the information provided. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right) and get a reward of +1. All other states give 0, except if you fall into a hole.

From the problem description, the environment is slippery. Each action taken by the agent results in moving to one of three directions with equal probability. So, for each action, there's a 33% chance for each possible direction outcome. This means that even if the agent chooses an action, it might not end up where it intended.

The policy is defined as an array of 16 elements (params[0] to params[15]), each representing the action taken when in that state. The actions are 0, 1, 2, or 3.

Looking at the examples provided:

In the top 6 best-performing policies, all have a reward around 0.35-0.45. The trajectories show that sometimes the agent falls into holes or takes longer paths. For example, one trajectory goes from state 0 to 4 (down), then to 8 (down again), but doesn't reach the goal.

The most recent policies have rewards of 0.00 and 0.20. The trajectories show that some policies might be stuck in loops or not making progress towards the goal, which is why their rewards are lower.

Since we're at iteration 945 out of 5000, it's a relatively early stage, but I'm supposed to act as an optimizer now because the rewards aren't too close to 1.0 yet.

As an optimizer, I should tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak. Looking at the top policies, they have certain patterns. For example, in state 0 (params[0]), many of them choose action 1 or 2. Similarly, in state 4 (params[4]), action 0 is common.

I need to consider what changes might lead to a higher reward. Maybe adjusting some states to take different actions that could help avoid holes more effectively or increase the chance of reaching the goal.

For instance, maybe in certain states, choosing an action with a higher probability of moving towards the goal would be better. Or perhaps some actions are causing the agent to fall into holes frequently, so changing those actions might prevent that.

Let me consider each state and think about which action could lead towards the goal or avoid holes more effectively.

State 0 (top-left corner): Choosing action 1 (which allows moving right, down, left) could help move towards the right. But since it's slippery, there's a chance to go down as well, which is towards state 4. Alternatively, action 2 might be better because it includes up and right directions, but being at the top-left, up isn't possible, so maybe it helps in moving right more.

Wait, no: for action 0, the agent can move down, left, or up. For action 1: right, down, left. Action 2: up, right, down. Action 3: left, up, right.

In state 0 (row 0, column 0), moving up isn't possible because it's already at the top. Similarly, moving left would take it to a previous state, which might be a hole or not. So, perhaps in state 0, choosing actions that have a higher chance of moving right or down is better.

Looking back at the policies, many choose action 1 for state 0. Maybe changing that to action 2 could help because action 2 includes moving up (but it's impossible here), so effectively, the agent has a higher chance of moving right or down when in state 0 with action 2.

Similarly, for other states, I need to evaluate which actions would lead closer to the goal without stepping into holes. For example, state 15 is the goal, so ensuring that once the agent reaches it, it's done.

I also notice that some policies have trajectories where they loop or fall into holes. So perhaps in certain states near the edges or near holes, adjusting actions to avoid those directions would be better.

For example, if a state is next to a hole, choosing an action that avoids moving towards the hole might prevent falling in.

In state 14 (which is row 3, column 2), the goal is at 15. So from 14, moving right should get to 15. However, because of the slippery nature, if the agent chooses action 0, it can move down, left, or up. From state 14, which is row 3, column 2: moving down isn't possible (since it's the bottom row), so perhaps choosing an action that has a higher chance of moving right would be better.

Looking at the current policies, in state 14, some have action 2 or 3. Action 2 for state 14 would allow up, right, or down. Since down is impossible, effectively, it's either up (to 10) or right (to 15). So choosing action 2 might increase the chance of moving right and achieving the goal.

Alternatively, action 3 allows left, up, or right. From state 14, moving left goes to 13, which is row 3, column 1. Not sure if that's a hole or not. If 13 is safe, then action 3 might also be good because it can move right.

Wait, but the holes are only certain states. From the problem statement, I don't know exactly where the holes are, but they must be some of the states that end the episode with 0 reward.

So to avoid falling into holes, the policy needs to choose actions that don't have any possible next state as a hole.

But without knowing which specific states are holes, it's challenging. However, based on trajectories, perhaps certain paths lead to falls, so we can infer.

Looking at one trajectory: (0,3) (1,3) (1,3)... which might be falling into a hole because it keeps moving right or something else. So maybe state 3 is a hole? Or state 1, etc.

Alternatively, in the top policies, some trajectories end with falling into holes, so perhaps certain states have high risks.

Given that, I should adjust the policy to choose actions that minimize the chance of ending up in those risky states.

For example, if from state X, choosing action Y leads to a hole 33% of the time, then changing the action might reduce the risk.

But without exact knowledge, perhaps focusing on the general direction towards the goal is better.

In summary, as an optimizer, I should slightly modify the best-performing policies to see if reward can be improved. Maybe switch some actions in key states like 0, 4, 12 (which is row 3, column 0), etc., to actions that have a higher chance of moving towards the goal or avoiding holes.

For instance, changing params[0] from 1 to 2 might help state 0 move right more often. Similarly, adjusting other states' actions to better navigate towards the goal while avoiding potential holes.

So I'll propose a new set of parameters that slightly differ from the top-performing ones but aim for better progress towards the goal.
