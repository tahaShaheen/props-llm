You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15, which gives a reward of +1, while avoiding holes that end the episode with zero reward.

First, I remember that the environment is slippery. Each action has a 33% chance to go in one of three directions. So, the policy needs to account for this uncertainty and choose actions that maximize the chances of reaching the goal without falling into any holes.

Looking at the previous top params, they all have relatively low rewards (around 0.25-0.45). The highest reward so far is 0.45, which isn't close to the optimal 1.0 mentioned earlier. This suggests that we're still in the exploration phase because the rewards aren't near the target.

The most recent params didn't perform well, with some even getting zero rewards. So, I need to try something different from what's been tried before. Since all previous policies are either not reaching the goal or falling into holes, maybe adjusting certain states' actions can help.

I notice that in state 0 (top-left corner), the current policy is often choosing action 1 or 2. Maybe trying a different action here could lead to better exploration. For example, setting params[0] to 3 might allow more right movements, which could be beneficial since moving right from (0,0) would take it to (0,1).

Looking at state 15, the goal, it's already good that the policy is set to action 3 or something else. But I need to ensure that any path leading to state 15 doesn't have holes blocking the way.

Another thought: perhaps some states near the bottom-right are choosing actions that lead them into holes. For example, if a state near the goal is choosing an action that could go down when it's already on the last row, that would be bad. So, adjusting these to move right or up instead might prevent falling into holes.

I also need to consider the slippery nature. Even if the policy chooses the correct direction, there's a chance it'll take another path. So, the policy should have redundancy in actions that can still lead towards the goal even with some randomness.

Maybe experimenting with specific states known to be problematic could help. For instance, states near the edges or corners might need different actions to avoid falling into adjacent holes.

Since I can't remember previous attempts (as per the stateless strategy), I should focus on proposing a new set of params that are distinct from those already tried. This means changing several parameters in key states to gather more information about which paths work and which don't.

I'll start by changing some of the top-performing params to try different actions in critical states. For example, if state 0 is currently using action 1 or 2, maybe switching it to action 3 could help move right, which might be better for reaching the goal on a slippery surface.

Similarly, I'll adjust other key states like those near the bottom and right edges to ensure that actions lead towards the goal without risking falling into holes. This might involve setting certain states to always move right or up, depending on their position.

Overall, my approach is to create a new set of params by altering several state-action pairs from previously tried configurations, focusing especially on starting states and those near the goal. The aim is to maximize information gain by testing a novel configuration that could potentially lead to higher rewards.
