You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get a reward of around 1.0 by reaching state 15, which means the agent needs to navigate successfully without falling into any holes. 

From the history provided, it looks like most policies have been giving low rewards, averaging around 0.35 or lower. That's way below the target of 1.0, so I should probably focus on exploring more rather than exploiting what I've already tried.

Looking at the recent attempts, a lot of them are getting stuck in loops or falling into holes quickly. For example, some trajectories end almost immediately, like (0,1) leading to state 4, which might be a hole since they got 0 reward. So maybe the issue is that certain states aren't being handled well, causing the agent to either fall into traps or get stuck in cycles.

I notice that many of the top policies are similar, just tweaking a few parameters here and there but not making significant changes. That suggests that maybe we need more drastic changes to break out of the patterns that lead to low rewards.

Since the environment is slippery, each action taken has a 1/3 chance of going in one of three directions. So, the policy needs to account for this uncertainty. Perhaps setting up actions that have higher probabilities of leading towards the goal while avoiding risky moves could help.

Let me think about some key states:

- State 0 (top-left corner): It can move down, right, or up with equal probability if action 1 is taken. But moving up from state 0 isn't possible because it's already at the top. So action 1 might lead to state 4 (down) or stay in state 0 if it tries to move up (which probably just stays put). Maybe choosing action 2 for state 0 could help, as it allows moving right, down, or up—though again, up isn't an option from the top.

Wait, no. The movement might wrap around or not? Probably not; moving up from the top row would stay in place, but I think in FrozenLake, you can't move beyond the grid, so movements that go out of bounds are ignored.

So for state 0 (top-left), action 1 is [right, down, left]. But since it's at the edge, moving left isn't possible. So from state 0, taking action 1 could lead to state 1 (right) or state 4 (down). Similarly, action 0 might be move down, but with a 3-way split.

Wait, according to the problem statement, when you take an action, you have three possibilities:

- Action 0: [down, left, up]
- Action 1: [right, down, left]
- Action 2: [up, right, down]
- Action 3: [left, up, right]

So for state 0 (top-left), which is at row 0, column 0. Moving up would stay in the same cell because you can't go beyond the grid. Similarly, moving left from column 0 stays put.

But actually, I think in FrozenLake, moving into a wall or out of bounds doesn't change the state; it just stays where it is. So for example, if you're at state 0 and take action up (which isn't allowed), you stay at 0.

Wait no, according to the problem statement, each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability, but it's a 4x4 grid. So movement from the edges would have fewer options.

But in the problem, when an action is taken, the agent picks one of three directions (as per action), and then moves accordingly, considering that moving beyond the grid doesn't change the state. For example, if you're at state 0 and take action up (from action 3: [left, up, right]), moving up would stay in state 0.

So for each state, I need to determine all possible next states based on the chosen action and the environment's slipperiness.

Given that, perhaps setting up a policy that always tries to move towards the goal with some redundancy could help. For example, prioritizing right and down movements since the goal is at (3,3), which corresponds to state 15.

Looking at the recent policies, many have params[0] set to 1 or 2. Let me check what those actions do:

- Action 1 for state 0: [right, down, left]. From state 0, moving right goes to state 1, down to state 4, and left stays at state 0.

So taking action 1 from state 0 has a chance of moving towards the goal (state 1 or 4) but also might stay put. Alternatively, action 2 for state 0 is [up, right, down]. From state 0, up doesn't change, right to state 1, and down to state 4.

So both actions 1 and 2 have similar possibilities. Maybe choosing action 3 could be better? Action 3's directions are left, up, right—so from state 0, that would lead to staying (left or up) or moving right (state 1). Hmm.

But I'm not sure. Let me look at the recent params. For example, in the most recent attempts, many have params[0] as 3, but those didn't get high rewards. Maybe trying different actions for key states like state 0 and state 7 could help.

Another approach is to consider that since each action has three possible outcomes, we need to set up a policy where, on average, the agent moves in the direction of the goal as much as possible, while avoiding holes.

Looking at the trajectories, some agents are falling into state 5 or 6 quickly. So perhaps states near those holes aren't being handled well by current policies.

I think I should propose a new policy that changes several parameters to see if it can avoid these issues and reach the goal more often. Since all previous attempts have low rewards, exploring is necessary.

Let me try setting up a policy where each state's action directs towards moving down or right as much as possible, considering the slippery nature.

For example:

- States in the top row (0-3): encourage moving down to get closer to the goal.
- Middle rows: move towards right and down.

But I need to translate that into specific actions. Let me map each state to an action that would promote moving towards the bottom-right.

Alternatively, perhaps a more systematic approach is needed, but given time constraints, I'll make educated guesses.

Let me propose setting params[0] to 2 (action 2: up, right, down). From state 0, this could help in moving right or down. Similarly, for other states near the top, set actions that allow moving towards the goal.

Alternatively, another approach is to have each state's action designed to move towards the next cell in a predefined path, but given the slipperiness, it's challenging.

Given all this, I'll propose a new policy where most states are set to either action 2 or 3, which include right and down movements. Let me check what that would look like for each state.

But since I'm constrained by the format, I need to come up with a specific array of actions.
