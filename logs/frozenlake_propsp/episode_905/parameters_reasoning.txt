You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me start by understanding the problem thoroughly.

First, the environment is a 4x4 grid, which means there are 16 states (0 to 15). The goal is state 15, and it gives a reward of +1 when reached. All other states give 0, except for holes which end the episode with no reward.

The agent's actions have slippery movement—meaning each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability. So, choosing an action doesn't guarantee moving in that direction; instead, there's a 33% chance for each of three possible moves.

The policy is defined by an array params of size 16, where each element represents the action taken in that state (0-15). The challenge is to find the optimal set of actions that maximizes the average reward over episodes.

Looking at the interaction history provided, I see several top-performing policies and their corresponding rewards. The highest reward mentioned is 0.45, which is below the target of 1.0. This suggests that the current policies are not consistently reaching the goal.

I need to think about what a near-optimal policy would look like. Ideally, it should navigate towards state 15 as efficiently as possible while avoiding holes. Since movement is slippery, the policy needs to account for uncertainty and choose actions that maximize the chances of moving closer to the goal without falling into holes.

In previous trials, policies have varied in their initial states (like params[0] being 1 or 2), which affects the first move. For example, if state 0 (top-left corner) chooses action 1, it might try to go right, but since movement is slippery, there's a chance to go down or left as well. Similarly, choosing action 2 from state 0 could lead to up, right, or down.

I should consider the structure of the grid and possible paths to the goal. The shortest path would be moving right and then down, but with the slippery nature, this requires careful selection of actions that balance between moving towards the target and avoiding dangerous states.

Holes are present in some positions, so the policy must avoid any action that could lead into these holes. For example, certain states near the edges or in specific rows might have adjacent holes that need to be avoided by choosing safer actions.

Looking at the recent policies, there's a lot of variation in how each state is handled. Some states seem to consistently choose certain actions, which might not always be optimal. To improve, perhaps we can find a more systematic approach—like always moving towards increasing row and column indices (i.e., right and down) while being cautious.

I also notice that in some cases, the same action is chosen across multiple states. Maybe there's an opportunity to vary actions based on the state's position relative to the goal. For example, in states closer to the bottom-right corner, more aggressive movement towards the goal might be warranted, whereas near the top-left, slower, more cautious movements could prevent falling into holes.

Another thought: since each action has a 33% chance of three directions, perhaps setting up actions that have a higher probability of moving towards the goal while having fallback options to avoid holes. For instance, from state 0 (top-left), choosing an action that primarily attempts to move right but also includes down and another direction as alternatives could be effective.

Also, considering recent policies where certain states are stuck in loops or not making progress towards the goal, maybe adjusting those states' actions to push them more towards the goal would help. For example, if a state is on the same row as the goal, prioritize rightward movements, and if on the same column, move downward.

Finally, since I'm supposed to propose a new set of params without repeating previous ones, I'll aim for a policy that makes logical moves based on each state's position. For example:

- States in the top-left (0) might choose actions that try to move right or down.
- Middle states could have actions that balance between moving closer and avoiding edges where holes are present.
- Near the goal, more direct movements would be beneficial.

Putting this together, I'll construct a params array where each state's action is chosen based on its position relative to the goal, aiming to maximize progress towards 15 while minimizing the risk of falling into holes.
