You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, let's try to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. So, from what I understand, it's a 4x4 grid where each state is represented by numbers from 0 to 15. The goal is to reach state 15, which gives a reward of +1, and avoid the holes that end the episode.

The slippery nature means that when the agent takes an action, there's a 33% chance it moves in one of three directions. So each action doesn't guarantee a specific movement; instead, the agent has to plan for all possibilities. That adds some uncertainty into the mix, making it trickier to navigate effectively.

Looking at the provided examples, I see that previous policies have achieved around 0.45 average reward over 20 episodes. The top-performing ones seem to be getting closer but still not reaching the optimal 1.0. So, my goal is to tweak these parameters to maximize the chance of reaching state 15 without falling into any holes.

The recent policies have trajectories that sometimes get stuck or loop in certain areas. For instance, one trajectory keeps moving right and down but ends up in a hole. Another gets stuck near the top-left corner. This suggests that maybe some states aren't being handled correctly—perhaps not directing towards the goal effectively or allowing for getting trapped.

I need to consider each state's optimal action. Let me map out the grid:

- State 0: (0,0) - top-left
- State 15: (3,3) - bottom-right

The agent should move towards increasing row and column indices to reach the goal. However, due to the slippery nature, actions might not lead directly where intended.

Looking at state 0 (top-left corner), possible moves are down, right, or up? Wait no, based on the description:

- Action 0: [down, left, up]
- Action 1: [right, down, left]
- Action 2: [up, right, down]
- Action 3: [left, up, right]

So for state 0 (top-left), moving left or up would take it out of bounds. Therefore, the best options are to move down or right. Since action 0 allows down and left but also up, which isn't useful from here. Action 1 includes right, which is better. So maybe choosing action 2 or 3 for state 0 could be better.

Wait no—action 0: when taking action 0 in state 0, it can move down (to state 4), left (which would be invalid, so perhaps stays?), or up (invalid). Similarly, action 1 allows moving right to state 1, down to state 4, or left. So from state 0, action 1 could potentially go right to state 1 with probability 1/3, which is better.

But in the previous top policies, for state 0, they used actions like 1 and 2. Maybe I need to see what's working best.

Looking at the recent params:

One of the recent ones had params[0] = 1, which might be a good direction since it can go right. But some trajectories ended in holes, so perhaps action choices from certain states are leading into danger.

I think the key is to create a policy that navigates towards state 15 while avoiding known hole positions. From the trajectories provided, I can infer where the holes might be located based on the points where the agent falls.

For example, one trajectory fell into a hole after moving from (0,3) multiple times. Maybe state 3 is a hole? Similarly, another trajectory went through (4,0), which could indicate that state 4 is safe but perhaps adjacent states are holes.

But without knowing exactly where the holes are, I need to make educated guesses based on trajectories.

Let's consider each state and decide what action would best lead towards the goal while minimizing risk of falling into a hole.

From state 0 (0,0), moving right or down seems better. So perhaps choosing action 1 (which includes right) or action 0 (down). In previous policies, they used action 1 for state 0 and it worked okay but sometimes led to issues. Maybe trying action 2 could be beneficial since it allows up, right, or down.

Wait, action 2 from state 0 would include up (invalid), right (state 1), or down (state4). So action 2 is similar to action 1 in terms of possible moves but includes a different set. Maybe varying the actions can help avoid getting stuck.

I should also consider the trajectories where agents successfully reach the goal, like one trajectory went from (0,1) -> (4,2) -> (8,2), which seems like moving down then right then up? Not sure, but that eventually reached state 8. From there, how to proceed?

Alternatively, perhaps some states near the bottom-right are closer and should have different actions. For example, state 13 is (3,0). If I'm in state 13, moving right would take me to state 14 or 15? Wait, no: each move affects either row or column. From state i, moving up decreases the row by 1, down increases it, left decreases column, right increases.

Wait, let's clarify:

Each state is represented as (row, col), where row = floor(i/4) and col = i % 4.

So for example:

- State 0: (0,0)
- State 3: (0,3)
- State 4: (1,0)
- ...
- State 15: (3,3)

So moving from state 12 (3,0), right would go to state 13 (3,1). From state 13, right goes to 14 (3,2) and then 15.

So if the agent is near the bottom row, it should move right towards 15.

Looking at previous policies, some had params[15] = 3, which includes moving left, up, or right. But since state 15 is the goal, maybe once there, staying put isn't necessary. However, reaching 15 gives +1 and ends the episode, so perhaps it's better to have actions that lead directly there.

In any case, considering all this, I think a greedy approach towards moving down or right would be optimal but needs to account for the slippery nature.

Given that, let me try to propose a new set of params. Since previous policies had some success with certain actions, maybe adjusting specific states could improve performance.

For example, in state 14 (3,2), choosing action 3 might allow moving up, right, or down. But since the goal is at (3,3), moving right would be ideal. So perhaps setting params[14] = 3 to have a chance to move right.

Similarly, for states near the bottom-right corner, ensuring that actions can lead towards state 15 is crucial.

Looking at the recent policies, many had params[15] set to 3, which might be good since from state 15, the agent has reached the goal and gets +1. But I need to make sure that the path leading to it doesn't fall into any holes.

Another point: the agent should avoid getting stuck in loops. For example, moving between states without making progress towards the goal. So ensuring that each action from a state has a higher probability of moving closer to the goal would be beneficial.

Perhaps I can design the policy so that:

- From states near the top-left (0-3), encourage downward and rightward movements.
- From middle states, choose actions that gradually move towards the bottom-right.
- Near the goal (states 12-15), prioritize moving right.

Given that, let me draft a possible set of params. I'll need to ensure that each state's action is selected from [0,1,2,3], and that it aligns with the best path.

For example:

params[0]: choose action that allows moving down or right (action 1 or 2)
params[1]: similarly, encourage moving down or right
...
states near bottom-right: choose actions that move right

But I'm not sure about exact values. Perhaps looking at the top-performing params and adjusting a few might yield better results.

In the top params, for state 0 it was action 1 (right), which seems good. Maybe keeping that but varying other states could help.

I think I'll propose changing some of the middle states to encourage more rightward movements and ensure that from states in row 3 (bottom row), moving right is prioritized.
