You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

Do NOT output anything else. No explanation, no reasoning, nothing.



LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to solve this RL problem where I need to find the optimal policy for a FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with the highest possible reward, which should ideally be around 1.0. 

Looking at the information provided, the environment is 4x4 grid, slippery, and has some holes. The agent can take actions that have three possible directions each with equal probability. My task is to propose a policy (params array of size 16) where each element is an action from [0,1,2,3]. 

The user mentioned that I should be stateless and only focus on maximizing information gain for the next iteration. The current best policies are giving around 0.45, which is significantly below 1.0, so I'm supposed to act as an Explorer, suggesting new configurations distinct from previous ones.

Looking at the top 5 best params, they have some patterns but none are reaching close to the goal. For example, the first one's trajectory ends at state 4 with action 2, which might not be leading towards the goal effectively.

As an Explorer, I need to try a completely new set of params that haven't been tried before. So I should generate a new policy where each state has a different action than the ones previously seen. 

I'll start by assigning actions in such a way that from each state, there's a higher chance of moving towards the goal (state 15). Since the environment is slippery, the agent can't rely on one action to get to the desired direction; instead, it should try to maximize the chances across possible moves.

For instance:
- From state 0 (top-left), I might choose action 3 (which has a chance to move right, down, or up) because moving right is a step towards the goal.
- Similarly, for other states near the edges or in positions that can lead closer to the goal, I'll assign actions that have higher probabilities of moving towards the target.

I need to ensure each param[i] is unique and hasn't been used before. Looking at previous params, certain patterns are repeated, so I should break those by assigning different actions.

After considering all states, I think a policy where each state has an action that's likely to move closer to the goal while avoiding holes would be beneficial. So I'll create a new set of params with varied actions across all 16 states, making sure it's distinct from previous attempts.
