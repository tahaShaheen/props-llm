You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to help optimize the policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me break down what I know.

First, the environment is a 4x4 grid where each state has four possible actions. But because it's slippery, taking an action doesn't always lead directly to the intended next state—it can go in one of three directions with equal probability. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) for a reward of +1. Other states give 0 rewards, and some are holes that end the episode.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 numbers, each indicating the action taken from that state. My task is to propose such a policy iteratively, aiming to maximize the episodic reward. The user has provided some top-performing policies along with their trajectories and rewards, as well as the most recent ones.

Looking at the top 5 best params, they all have rewards around 0.35 to 0.45, which is below the target of 1.0. This suggests that we're not yet close to the optimal solution. So, according to the stateless strategy, since the rewards are far from 1.0, I should act as an Explorer and propose new policies distinct from previous ones to gather more information.

In the most recent params, several states have actions that might not be leading towards the goal effectively. For instance, some trajectories loop or get stuck in holes. To improve, I need to ensure that each state's action choice avoids holes and moves closer to the goal.

I'll consider setting up a policy where each state pushes the agent towards the right or down as much as possible, since those directions lead towards the goal (state 15). However, due to the slippery nature, it's crucial to choose actions that have a higher probability of moving in the desired direction.

Looking at specific states:
- State 0: Top-left. Moving right or down makes sense. Let's try action 1 (right) since it can also move down and left, but maybe action 3 might be better.
- State 1: Middle-top. Maybe down to get closer to the goal.
- State 2: Further top-right. Perhaps action 0 or 3 to go right or down.
- State 3: Top-right corner. Action 3 (right) is stuck, so maybe down is better.

I'll need to adjust each state's action carefully, ensuring they don't lead into holes and have a path towards the goal. Since I can't remember previous attempts, I should vary the actions across different states to explore new trajectories that might avoid pitfalls and reach the goal more efficiently.
