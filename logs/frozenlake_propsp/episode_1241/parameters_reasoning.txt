You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help optimize the policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get a reward of 1 by reaching state 15, which is the bottom-right corner. But there are holes that make the agent fall and end the episode with zero reward. The environment is slippery, meaning each action has a probability of going in one of three directions.

Looking at the previous interactions, I can see that the current best policies are getting around 0.45 to 0.35 rewards on average. That's not too bad, but it's still below the target of 1.0. The user mentioned that the optimal reward should be around 1.0, so we need to figure out a way to get closer to that.

The trajectories provided show some paths where the agent is moving towards state 15 but either gets stuck in loops or falls into holes. For example, one trajectory goes from (0,2) to (4,2), which is moving down, but then seems to loop around without reaching the goal. Another path takes a longer route and still doesn't reach the goal.

Since I'm supposed to act as a stateless optimizer, I can't remember previous attempts, so each suggestion should aim to maximize information gain. Given that the current best is around 0.45, which is not very close to 1.0, maybe we're in the exploration phase where we need to try different strategies to find a better path.

I notice that some policies are taking action 2 or 3 from state 0 (top-left corner). Let's think about what those actions do:

- Action 0: move down, left, up
- Action 1: move right, down, left
- Action 2: move up, right, down
- Action 3: move left, up, right

From state 0 (0,0), moving up isn't possible because it's the top row. So actions that have up as an option might lead to falling into a hole or going out of bounds, which I think in this environment just stays on the grid but doesn't progress.

Wait, actually, in many grid environments, if you try to move beyond the boundaries, you stay put. But since there are holes, moving left from state 0 would also keep it in place or maybe go into a hole? Hmm, not sure.

Looking at the previous policies, when params[0] is set to 1 (action right), that might be a good start because from (0,0) moving right takes you to (0,1). But sometimes that leads to loops. Maybe trying a different action here could help.

Another thought: if we can get the agent to move towards state 15 as directly as possible, avoiding holes. For example, always moving down or right when possible. But considering the slipperiness, it's hard to predict where exactly it will end up.

Looking at params[15], which is the goal state, but in this setup, if the agent reaches state 15, they get a reward. So we need policies that eventually lead there. Maybe adjusting the actions for states near 15 could help.

Wait, the user mentioned that the policy needs to avoid holes by using previous trajectories. So perhaps some states have been identified as safe or not based on prior attempts.

Given the recent params, it seems like setting certain states to action 0, 2, or 3 might be leading to loops or getting stuck. Maybe we should try changing a few key parameters to break those loops and push towards the goal more directly.

Let me think of some new configurations that are different from what's been tried before. For example, maybe setting params[14] (which is state 14) to action 3 instead of another action. Or adjusting states near the edges to prioritize moving right or down.

Alternatively, perhaps focusing on key decision points, like state 7 and state 12, which are closer to the goal. If those can be set to move towards the goal with higher probability, that might increase the chances of reaching it.

Wait, but since each action only gives a 1/3 chance in three directions, maybe setting the actions so that one of the options is directly towards the goal and the others are either safer or also leading towards it could help.

For instance, from state 0 (top-left), if we set action to right (action 1), then there's a 1/3 chance to go right to (0,1), which is safe. But sometimes that leads to loops as seen in the trajectories. Maybe trying action 2, which includes moving up and right, but from state 0, moving up isn't possible, so it would have higher probability to move right or down.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky without knowing the exact layout of the holes. But I can make educated guesses based on the trajectories provided.

Perhaps trying to set params[0] to action 2 could give a better chance to move towards state 15 by moving right or down. Similarly, for other states near the edges, choosing actions that have movement towards the goal as one of the options.

Also, looking at recent attempts, some had low rewards (like 0.05), which suggests they might be getting stuck in holes more often. So adjusting policies to avoid those paths would be beneficial.

In summary, I need to propose a new set of params that are different from previous ones and aim to get the agent closer to state 15 while avoiding known dangerous states.
