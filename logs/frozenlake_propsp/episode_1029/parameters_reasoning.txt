You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure this out. So I'm trying to help optimize a policy for the FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get the highest possible reward by reaching state 15 without falling into any holes. 

First, I need to understand how the environment works. It's a 4x4 grid, and each state has four possible actions: left, down, right, up. But because it's slippery, taking an action leads to one of three directions with equal probability. So for example, if I take action 0, there's a 1/3 chance to move down, left, or up.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 numbers (params), each corresponding to the action taken in that state. The challenge is to find the optimal set of actions that maximizes the reward, which should ideally be around 1.0 since reaching the goal gives +1 and all others give 0.

Looking at the examples provided, it seems like some policies are performing better than others. The top-performing ones have an average reward of about 0.45, which is still below the target of 1.0. So we need to figure out why they aren't reaching the goal more often and adjust the policy accordingly.

I notice that in the trajectories provided, many policies are getting stuck or falling into loops without reaching state 15. For instance, one trajectory goes from (0,1) to (4,0) repeatedly, never making progress towards the goal. This suggests that some states aren't being handled correctly, leading to cycles instead of moving towards the target.

I think the key is to ensure that each state has a clear path towards state 15, considering the slippery nature of movement. For example, state 0 (top-left corner) should probably move right or down to start heading towards the goal. Similarly, states near the bottom-right might need specific actions to reach state 15 without falling into holes.

I also need to consider the holes in the environment. The exact locations aren't specified, but knowing which states are holes is crucial because stepping on them ends the episode with no reward. So the policy must avoid actions that could lead to these holes from neighboring states.

Given that I'm supposed to output a new set of params without repeating previous ones and maximize information gain, I should vary the actions in strategic positions to test different paths towards the goal. For instance, changing the action for state 0 from 1 to 2 might help explore a different route.

Let me outline potential changes:

- State 0 (top-left): Maybe take action 2 instead of 1 to move right with some probability.
- States near the top-right (like 3) should probably go down to avoid going out of bounds or hitting holes.
- Middle states might need more careful handling to ensure they don't loop and keep moving towards the bottom-right.

I also need to make sure that each state's action gives a chance to move closer to the goal without too much risk of falling into holes. For example, if from state 4 (second row first column), moving right or down might be safer depending on nearby holes.

Given all this, I'll propose a new set of params where some key states have their actions adjusted to explore different paths towards the goal while avoiding potential traps. This should help in breaking out of loops and increasing the chance of reaching state 15.
