You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help optimize the policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me think about what's going on here.

First, the environment is a 4x4 grid, and the goal is to reach state 15, which gives +1 reward. All other states give 0. The slippery nature means that when you take an action, there's a 33% chance of moving in one of three directions, depending on the action chosen.

Looking at the previous policies provided, all have low rewards around 0.10 to 0.15. That suggests that none are consistently reaching the goal yet. So I need to explore more to find better policies.

The top-performing params seem to be those where certain states choose actions that eventually lead towards state 15 without falling into holes. For example, in the first top param, the policy is mostly choosing right and down actions (actions 1 and 3). But since the environment is slippery, this might not always work.

In iteration 169, I'm supposed to propose a new set of params that haven't been tried before. Since all previous policies have low rewards, I should focus on exploration rather than exploitation. So, I need to come up with a completely new configuration that's different from the ones listed.

Let me consider the structure of the grid. The agent starts at state 0 (top-left). To reach state 15, it needs to move right or down multiple times. However, because of the slippery nature, each action can send the agent in three possible directions.

Maybe I should design a policy that, for each state, encourages moving towards the goal while avoiding known holes. But since we don't know where the holes are exactly (they aren't specified), it's tricky. So, perhaps using a more cautious approach or a strategy that allows the agent to correct its path when it veers off.

Looking at the previous trajectories, some end in loops or get stuck moving in circles. This suggests that certain policies lead to the agent not making progress towards the goal. To avoid this, I might need to vary the actions more to break out of such patterns.

What if for each state, the policy alternates between different directions? For example, from state 0 (top-left), choosing action 1 (right, down, left) could help it move right with some probability but also allow it to adjust direction if needed. Similarly, other states could have a mix of actions that balance moving towards the goal while being flexible.

Another thought: maybe using a policy where each state has an action that prioritizes moving towards the right or down, but includes another option to help escape potential loops. For example, mixing right and up actions might allow the agent to backtrack if it gets stuck.

I should also consider symmetry. The grid is symmetrical in some ways, so perhaps certain patterns can be applied across states. For instance, all edge states could have similar policies designed to move towards the goal while avoiding edges that lead into holes.

Wait, looking at one of the previous top params, they had a pattern where even-numbered states (0,2,4,...) chose action 1 or 3, which are right/down and left/up. Maybe I can try varying this by introducing different actions in certain key states to see if that helps break out of suboptimal paths.

For example, maybe changing the policy for state 8 (top-left of the bottom row) to choose a different action than before could help it move closer to the goal without falling into a hole. Or perhaps making sure that from certain states, there's a higher chance to move right or down towards the goal.

I need to ensure that each proposed params is unique and hasn't been tried before. So I'll go through each state and assign an action (0-3) that hasn't been commonly used in previous policies for that state.

Let me try constructing such a policy step by step:

1. State 0: Let's choose action 2, which includes up, right, down. This might help the agent move towards either right or down.
2. State 1: Maybe action 3 (left, up, right) to balance directions and avoid getting stuck on the edge.
3. State 2: Action 0 (down, left, up). Moving down is towards the goal.
4. State 3: Action 1 (right, down, left). Right leads towards the next column.
5. Continue this pattern, alternating actions to encourage movement towards state 15 while providing flexibility.

I need to make sure each state's action is from [0,1,2,3] and hasn't been used in previous top policies for that state. I'll check each state against the examples provided and assign an unused action.

After mapping out such a policy, it should be unique and potentially lead to higher rewards by avoiding known pitfalls and encouraging progress towards the goal.
