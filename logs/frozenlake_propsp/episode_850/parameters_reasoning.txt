You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, let's try to figure out the best policy parameters for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) while avoiding holes. From the problem description, I understand that each action has a 33% chance of moving in three possible directions because the environment is slippery.

Looking at the provided top 5 best performing params and their trajectories, it seems that most policies are getting an average reward around 0.45. That's lower than the target of 1.0, which suggests there's room for improvement. The recent policies have even lower rewards (like 0.05 or 0), so maybe I need to explore more rather than exploit what's working.

I should consider how each state's action affects reaching the goal and avoiding holes. Let's think about key states:

1. **Starting Position (State 0)**: The agent is at the top-left corner. Moving right (action 1) seems logical because it moves towards the goal, but I need to check if that's optimal.

2. **States near the goal**: For example, state 14 (which is one step above the goal) should ideally move down to reach the goal. Similarly, state 13 (to the left of the goal) might benefit from moving right or down.

3. **Holes**: The problem doesn't specify where the holes are, but in standard FrozenLake, they're at states 5, 6, 7, etc. So I need to ensure that actions from these states don't lead into the water.

Looking at previous params, some policies have higher rewards when certain actions are taken. For example, action 1 for state 0 (top-left) seems common because it moves right, which is towards the goal.

Now, since we're in iteration 850 out of 5000 and recent rewards are low, I should focus on exploring new policies that might yield higher rewards. Maybe tweaking some key states' actions could lead to better success.

Let's try changing a few critical states:

- **State 14**: Currently, the best params have it set to action 3 (which moves left, up, or right with equal probability). But maybe moving down would be better since state 15 is directly below. So changing it to action 2 or 0 could help.

- **States near holes**: For example, if a hole is at state 5, then the actions from states leading into it should avoid that path.

Another approach is to ensure that once the agent gets close to the goal, it doesn't wander off. Maybe setting certain states to move directly towards the goal or stay in place if they're already on the right track.

Given that the environment is slippery and movements are probabilistic, the policy needs to account for all possible directions each action could lead. So, perhaps the best approach is to have actions that, on average, increase the likelihood of moving towards the goal without stepping into holes.

Looking back at the top params, state 0 was set to action 1 (right), which seems logical. Maybe I can try adjusting this or another key state to see if it improves the reward.

Since the recent policies have lower rewards, perhaps introducing more exploration in certain states could help. For example, changing a few actions from their current best settings to others and seeing how that affects the trajectory.

In conclusion, I'll propose a new set of parameters where critical states near the goal are adjusted to move directly towards it and ensure other paths avoid holes. Let's see if this leads to better performance.
