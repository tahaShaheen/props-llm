You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with the highest possible reward, avoiding holes along the way. From what's given, the environment is slippery, meaning each action leads to a random direction with equal probability.

Looking at the provided data, it seems that the best-performing policies so far are averaging around 0.30 in reward, which is significantly below the target of 1.0. This indicates that the current strategies aren't consistently reaching the goal without falling into holes. My task now is to propose a new set of parameters that either explore new territories or slightly tweak existing good ones to maximize information gain.

I notice that most policies have high variability in their actions, which might be causing them to get stuck or fall into holes more often. Maybe focusing on deterministic paths towards the goal could help. Since each action leads to three possible directions, perhaps choosing actions that generally point towards the right direction (like moving down and right) would increase the chances of reaching state 15.

I also need to ensure that the proposed policy hasn't been tried before. From the history, I see that certain states have specific actions assigned frequently. For example, params[0] is often set to 2 or 1, which correspond to moving up, right, or down. Maybe trying a different action here could lead to new trajectories.

Let me consider each state and decide on an action that increases the likelihood of moving towards the goal without hitting holes. For instance:

- State 0 (top-left corner): Moving down is safe and starts the journey towards the bottom-right.
- States near the top row: Encourage downward movement to progress closer to the goal.
- Mid-row states: Focus on right or down actions depending on their position.
- Rightmost column (states 3,7,11, etc.): Prioritize moving right or up/down carefully to avoid holes.

I'll create a policy where each state's action is chosen to generally move towards the bottom-right while avoiding obvious paths that lead into holes. Since I can't remember previous attempts, I have to rely on maximizing information gain by selecting actions that haven't been tried much before in each state.

After considering all this, I think setting params[0] to 2 (move up, right, down) might help explore new paths from the start. Similarly, adjusting other states to push towards the goal more directly while avoiding repetitive action choices could yield better results.
