You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to find the best policy for this FrozenLake environment where the agent is navigating a 4x4 grid. The goal is to reach state 15, which is the bottom right corner, and get the highest reward possible. All other states give zero except for the slippery condition.

First, I need to understand how the policy works. Each state (which ranges from 0 to 15) has an action selected from [0,1,2,3]. These correspond to directions left, down, right, up. The agent's goal is to move through these states in a way that maximizes the reward.

The environment is slippery, meaning when the agent takes any action (each direction), there's equal probability of choosing each option. So, from any state, regardless of the policy, the agent has 25% chance to pick left, right, up, or down. That makes the decision-making a bit more uncertain.

I remember that in reinforcement learning, policies are often represented as probability vectors. Each element corresponds to an action and indicates how likely each action is when in that state. For example, if params[i] = 0, it means taking action 0 (left) has zero chance; action 1 (right) also zero; etc.

Since all actions are equally likely from any state due to the slipiness condition, I can't use deterministic policies like always moving forward or backward. Instead, I need a probabilistic approach that considers all possible paths towards the goal.

Looking at the provided examples, some params have multiple 3s and varying others. For instance, in one example, params[0] is 2 (down), which means action 2 is chosen with 100% probability when on state 0. This leads to going down from any state, which makes sense because it's the most direct path towards the goal.

But I recall that sometimes using certain actions can lead to more efficient paths or avoid getting stuck in holes. Since there are holes (like grid positions where stepping on them ends the game), I need to explore these areas as well.

I also notice that some parameters have 0s, which might mean avoiding immediate bad moves and favoring safer ones towards the goal. For example, params[5] is 1, which means action 3 (up) has zero chance if it's on state 5. This could be a way to avoid being stuck in the hole.

Another point is that some actions are always taken with higher probabilities (like action 2:3 and 3:3) when they might not be necessary, such as from certain states. For instance, taking action 0 (left) or action 2 (up) with high probability from state 6 could be strategic to avoid being in a hole.

I think the best approach is to try all possible combinations where each action has equal likelihood across all options. That way, the agent doesn't get stuck on any single path and explores different routes towards the goal.

So, I'll set params[i] = 0.25 for actions 0,1,2,3 in every state because that's the average probability each action has when choosing randomly. This ensures exploration without favoring any particular direction, allowing the agent to find the optimal path.
