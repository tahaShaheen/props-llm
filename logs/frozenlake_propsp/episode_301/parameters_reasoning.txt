You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to help find the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15, which gives a reward of +1, while avoiding holes that end the episode. The environment is slippery, meaning each action has three possible outcomes with equal probability.

First, I need to understand how the policies have been performing so far. From the given data, the best-performing policy achieved an average reward of 0.25, which is low but better than others. However, none have reached close to 1.0 yet, so we're in the exploration phase.

Looking at recent attempts, most policies aren't getting very far, often ending quickly or not reaching the goal consistently. The trajectories show that some policies are looping or falling into holes early on. So, I need a policy that can navigate more effectively towards state 15 while avoiding known dangerous states.

I'll consider what makes a good policy. It should guide the agent towards state 15 as efficiently as possible. Since the environment is slippery, the policy needs to account for the probabilistic movements and choose actions that statistically increase the chances of moving closer to the goal.

Let me analyze each state's optimal action:

- State 0 (top-left corner): Possible actions could be down or right. But since it's slippery, choosing an action that covers multiple directions might help. Maybe action 1 (which can move right, down, or left) is good because moving right from 0 gets to state 1, but down takes it to state 4.

- State 1: From here, moving right would take to state 2, and other actions could go back or down. Perhaps action 3 is better as it can move left, up, or right. But since we want to progress towards the goal, maybe moving right or down is better.

Wait, but given the slippery nature, perhaps a more cautious approach is needed. Let me think about each state's neighbors and which actions would statistically bring the agent closer to 15.

Looking at the grid:

States 0-3: top row
4-7: second row
8-11: third row
12-15: bottom row

The goal is 15. So, moving towards increasing states in rows and columns would help. For example, from state 0 (row 0, column 0), the best moves are right or down. But considering the slipperiness, choosing an action that covers both might be better.

In the best-performing policy mentioned earlier, params[0] was 2. Action 2 for state 0 allows moving up, right, or down. Up isn't possible from state 0, so it's effectively a choice between right and down with equal probability to other directions. Maybe that's not optimal.

Another approach is to map each state to the action that maximizes the chance of moving towards higher-numbered states, which generally lead towards the goal. For example, in state 14 (which is one step left from 15), taking right would win, but since it's slippery, maybe choosing an action that has a high probability of moving right or up/down.

Wait, let me think about each state's position and possible actions:

For state 0:
- Action 0: down, left, up (but can't go left or up from 0)
- Action 1: right, down, left
- Action 2: up, right, down
- Action 3: left, up, right

Since action 2 allows moving right or down with some probability, and avoiding getting stuck in loops. Maybe choosing action 2 for state 0 is better than others.

Similarly, for other states, I need to choose actions that generally move towards higher-numbered states without falling into holes.

But since we don't have information about the hole positions, perhaps focusing on a policy that navigates directly towards the goal while avoiding edges where holes are likely.

Alternatively, considering that in the top examples, some policies were getting trajectories like (0,1) -> (4,2), which is moving down from 0 to 4, then right. That might be a good path if it continues towards higher states.

Given that, perhaps setting params such that each state chooses an action that moves towards increasing row and column numbers would help.

But since the environment is slippery, maybe the policy should encourage actions that have a higher chance of moving in the desired direction when possible.

Another angle: looking at recent policies, many are getting stuck or not progressing. So, perhaps changing the action for state 0 to something that encourages more movement towards the right or down, which would help reach the goal faster.

Wait, the best-performing policy had params[0] as 2, but that only gave an average of 0.25. Maybe adjusting some key states could improve this.

For example, if I can create a policy where from state 14 (which is just left of the goal), the action chosen leads to moving right with higher probability. But since all actions are slippery, perhaps choosing an action that has a high chance of moving right or down when possible.

But without knowing hole positions, it's tricky. However, I can assume holes are in certain states, so the policy should avoid getting into known dangerous areas.

In conclusion, after analyzing, I think setting each state to choose an action that moves towards higher-numbered states as much as possible would be beneficial. So, for state 0, perhaps choosing action 1 (which allows right, down, or left) since right is towards the goal and down is also a path towards it.

Let me propose a policy where most states choose actions that move them towards increasing row and column numbers, avoiding loops.
