You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The problem is that it's slipping, which means when an action is taken, all three possible directions are equally likely. That adds some complexity because each direction has a 1/3 chance, not just two as in standard grid-based environments.

The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right corner), which gives a +1 reward. All other states give 0, except when stepping on a hole. The agent explores through previous trajectories, so it needs to remember what's been seen before and avoid revisiting the same paths repeatedly.

The policy is represented by an array of 16 parameters, each corresponding to a state from 0 to 15. Each parameter value (params[i]) indicates which action to take when in state i. The possible values are [0, 1, 2, 3], representing the four directions: left, right, down, up.

The challenge is that without knowing the specific parameters, it's hard to set them optimally because each parameter affects multiple states and transitions based on the slipping action probabilities. I remember from previous knowledge that in such grid problems, sometimes a uniform random policy might be effective, especially when there are no deterministic loops or cycles that can exploit specific patterns.

Since the environment is slippery, we don't want to prioritize certain actions just because they lead to immediate rewards. Instead, the agent should explore more thoroughly and avoid getting stuck in suboptimal paths. The most recent examples show that some parameters have been set where all are 2 except for one (params[1] or params[3]), which was set as 0, 1, etc., but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

I think a good approach would be to try out a uniform policy. That is, each state randomly chooses an action among left, right, up, and down with equal probability (each having a 25% chance). This way, there's no bias towards any direction, which should help in exploring the grid without being too predictable.

But wait, maybe not exactly random. Since the agent can move in all four directions when slipping is considered, perhaps each state should have all actions available with equal probability. So for each state i (from 0 to 15), the policy would select among [left, right, up, down] uniformly. That would mean params[i] could be something like [2, 2, 2, 2], but that might not be feasible because each parameter is an action index.

Wait, actually, in the given problem, each params[i] represents which action to take when on state i. So if for all states, params[i] = 0 (which means left), then from any state, the action would always be left, ignoring other possibilities due to slipping. But that might not mix well with the grid structure.

Alternatively, perhaps for each state, we can set one parameter to take a different action, but I'm not sure if that's necessary or beneficial. Maybe sticking with a uniform selection for all actions is simpler and more effective in this case.

Another idea is to consider whether any states have deterministic loops or patterns where the optimal path can be exploited. But looking at the provided examples doesn't show any such loops beyond the immediate goals.

So, putting it all together: I'll set each params[i] to represent one of the four actions with equal probability for all states. This should allow exploration without over-relying on certain actions, which could prevent getting stuck in local optima or suboptimal paths.
