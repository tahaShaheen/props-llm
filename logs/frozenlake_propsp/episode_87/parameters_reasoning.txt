You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with the highest reward possible. The policy is represented by a list of four actions, each corresponding to state 0 through 3 in the grid.

First, I understand that each action has different probabilities based on the parameters. When an action is taken, it can result in moving left, right, up, or down with equal probability (25% chance) unless specified otherwise. This means if the agent takes action 0, it will choose between left, down, and up; for action 1, it's between right, down, and left; for 2, it's up, right, down; and for 3, it's left, up, right.

The reward system is such that all states except state 15 (the goal) give a reward of 0, while state 15 yields +1. The agent should explore the environment by revisiting previously visited states to find holes and avoid falling into them. This suggests that the agent needs to balance exploration and exploitation effectively.

Looking at the examples provided, some parameters achieve a reward of around 1.0 or higher, indicating they are effective in reaching the goal without getting stuck. However, others have lower rewards, showing that sometimes it's necessary to explore more deeply to find the best path.

I need to set the parameters to [params[0], params[1], ..., params[15]] where each can be 0, 1, 2, or 3. The challenge is to find a combination that maximizes the expected reward while preventing falling into holes (i.e., avoiding state 15).

Since the environment is slippery and has some holes, the policy must avoid being stuck there unless necessary. This means exploring nearby states more thoroughly might be beneficial.

I think starting with the highest values for higher-numbered actions could help explore other areas more, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, a balanced approach where all actions are explored equally might provide stability and better coverage.

Given that some parameters achieve 0.25 or lower rewards, maybe we need to ensure that certain directions are prioritized in exploration. For instance, trying to avoid getting stuck near state 15 could be crucial.

I should consider the fact that the agent is on a grid where moving up from state 3 (bottom row) leads back to the top. This creates a loop unless handled properly. So, balancing between exploring up and not getting stuck might be key.

Perhaps setting action 2 to 0 would prevent some cycles but allow other actions to explore more freely. However, action 2's probabilities are for up, right, and down, so if it's set to higher values, the agent might prioritize moving around more.

Alternatively, focusing on exploration in all directions equally could ensure that all areas of the grid are visited, which is especially important given the hole at state 15. But I'm not sure how much exploration each action needs compared to other actions.

I think a starting point would be setting parameters such as params[0] = 2, params[1] = 3, params[2] = 1, etc., but this is speculative. The actual optimal set might require more experimentation or analysis of the specific states and their transitions.
