You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The problem seems a bit tricky because it's a deterministic environment with a slippery action choice, which means each action has an equal probability of going in three directions if taken randomly.

First, I need to understand the setup better. The state is represented by a number from 0 to 15, corresponding to each grid cell in a 4x4 grid. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right corner), which gives a +1 reward. All other states give a reward of 0.

The policy function takes the current state as input and outputs an action (0-3). These actions correspond to directions left, down, up, or right. The values in params[0] through params[15] represent the optimal actions for each state. My task is to choose these parameters such that the total reward f(params) is maximized.

The policy starts with all parameters set to 1.0, which probably doesn't lead anywhere because of the slippery action choices. I need to adjust these values strategically.

Looking at the provided examples, some params give higher rewards (like around 0.25 or 0.30). The best reward so far is about 0.30 with a certain set of parameters. However, this might not be the global optimum because other paths could yield even better results.

I recall that in such problems, sometimes using multiple steps or considering different action sequences can lead to better outcomes. But since each action choice affects only one step (due to the slippery policy), I need to explore the environment thoroughly.

One approach is to test all possible action combinations for a few states. For example, at state 0, which is top-left, the optimal action could be right or down. Testing these options might reveal whether taking specific actions first leads to better rewards.

Another thought is using an exploration strategy where each set of parameters has been seen before, so I can skip it if the same state configurations have already been explored. This would save computation time and focus on promising states.

I should also consider that sometimes, even with deterministic rules, choosing a suboptimal action now might open up better paths later, leading to higher rewards overall.

Given these considerations, I think the key is to test various parameters for different state transitions and see which one accumulates more reward over time. Since the environment isn't fully connected (holes exist), the agent needs to explore thoroughly through trajectories.
