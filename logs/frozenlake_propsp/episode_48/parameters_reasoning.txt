You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 48 out of 5000. OUTPUT ONLY THIS SINGLE LINE:
params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W
Do NOT output anything else. No explanation, no reasoning, nothing.



LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get a reward of around 1.0, which means reaching state 15 without falling into any holes. 

Looking at the top performing params provided earlier, their average reward is 0.10, which is pretty low. That suggests that so far, none of the policies have been very effective in getting to the goal consistently or avoiding holes. The trajectories show that some policies are either not reaching the goal quickly or falling into traps early on.

Since the rewards are still far below 1.0, I should adopt an exploratory approach. My goal is to maximize information gain by proposing a new set of params that haven't been tried before and could potentially explore different paths towards state 15.

I need to make sure that each state's action in the policy doesn't lead into any holes based on previous trajectories. For example, if certain states are known to be near holes, I should choose actions that avoid those directions. 

Let me think about each state individually. Starting from state 0 (top-left corner), possible actions could go right, down, or up with equal probability due to the slippery nature. But since moving right would take it to state 1, which is safe based on previous trajectories. Maybe setting params[0] to action 1 (which leads to [right, down, left]) might give a chance to move towards the goal.

For state 1 (top-middle), the same logic applies. Action 2 could be better as it has a mix of directions that could help in moving towards the right or down. 

Continuing this way, I should ensure that each action choice increases the likelihood of reaching state 15 while avoiding known traps. Since the environment is 4x4, planning paths that move towards the bottom-right direction makes sense. 

I'll propose a new set of params where most states are set to either right or down actions, depending on their position. This should help guide the agent more directly towards state 15.

After considering all this, I'll create a new params array with these values.
