You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help optimize the policy for the FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get an episodic reward close to 1.0 by reaching state 15 without falling into any holes. Let me think through how to approach this.

First, I know that the environment is slippery, meaning each action can lead to three possible moves with equal probability. So, even if the policy takes a certain action, there's uncertainty in where it ends up. This makes planning tricky because the agent has to account for these probabilistic outcomes.

Looking at the state layout: 0-3 are top row, 4-7 second, 8-11 third, and 12-15 bottom. Holes aren't explicitly mentioned except in trajectories, so I have to infer their positions based on previous attempts where agents fell into them. From the trajectories provided, I see that some states led to holes.

For example, in the recent trials:
- params[0]:3 led to (0,2) moving to (1,3), which might be a hole or not.
- Another trial went from state 0 to 4, then to 8, and so on. Maybe certain states are traps.

I need to ensure that each action taken doesn't have any possibility of falling into a hole. So for each state, the policy should choose an action that maximizes the chance of moving towards 15 without risk.

Looking at the current best params:
The top-performing ones had f(params) around 0.45, which is not great. The global optimal is around 1.0, so we need to improve.

Since it's a stateless strategy and I can't remember previous attempts, each suggestion must be based on maximizing information gain. If rewards are low (like below 0.3), I should explore more by trying different actions in states, especially those that haven't been tried before.

In the recent params, some states have certain actions repeated a lot. For example, state 0 often chooses action 1 or 2. Maybe changing it to another action could help avoid holes and find new trajectories.

I'll try to vary the actions for each state, ensuring they don't lead to known problematic paths. For instance, in state 0, instead of action 1 (which leads down, left, or right), maybe choosing a different action that moves towards the goal without hitting holes.

Let me construct a new set of params where I change some actions in key states. Maybe for state 12 and 13, which are close to the goal, ensure they take actions that directly move towards 15.

But wait, the agent can't plan, so it's more about selecting actions that don't lead to holes when possible. So each action should be chosen such that none of its three possible outcomes are a hole, and at least one leads closer to the goal.

I need to make sure that for each state, the selected action has safe possible moves. If I can get as many states as possible pointing towards 15 with no risk of falling into holes, that would be optimal.

Perhaps focusing on the states near the goal (like 13 and 14) to choose actions that go right or down if applicable. For example, state 12 is at the bottom row; moving right from there would reach 15.

I should also look at previous trajectories where agents fell into holes. For example, some states when taking certain actions led to holes, so I need to avoid those combinations.

Overall, my approach is to vary each state's action slightly from the best performing ones, ensuring that they don't lead to known bad outcomes and have a path towards the goal.
