You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I need to help find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment with a slippery grid and holes. The goal is to reach state 15, which gives +1 reward, while avoiding the holes that end the episode.

First, I should understand the structure of the problem. It's a 4x4 grid where each state is numbered from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). Each action has a 33% chance of moving in three directions due to slipperiness. The policy is an array of 16 actions, each being 0-3.

The agent's goal is to reach the bottom-right corner (state 15). So, I should consider paths that lead towards this state without stepping on holes. From the trajectories provided, it seems some policies are getting stuck or falling into holes, as their rewards are below 0.45, which is much lower than the target of around 1.0.

Looking at the most recent parameters and trajectories:

- The last few params have f(params) ranging from 0.15 to 0.20, indicating low success rates.
- Trajectories show agents getting stuck in loops or falling into holes quickly.

Given that rewards are far below 1.0, I should act as an "Explorer" by trying new parameters distinct from previous ones. The goal is to maximize information gain and find paths that avoid holes and reach the goal.

I need to propose a params array where each state's action leads closer to the goal or avoids dangerous states.

Starting with state 0 (top-left), I might choose an action that moves right (action 1) or down (action 3). But considering slipperiness, maybe choosing actions that have a higher chance of moving towards the goal in general.

Looking at state 15 (goal): it's best to stay there once reached. So params[15] should probably be an action that doesn't move, but since all actions cause movement with some probability, perhaps setting it to any action is fine as reaching it gives +1 regardless.

For states near the goal, like 12, 13, 14, I should choose actions that increase the chance of moving right or down towards 15. Similarly, for earlier states, actions that guide towards these positions.

However, considering the slipperiness, each action has a 33% chance to go in three directions. So, the policy needs to account for that uncertainty and try to maximize the chances of reaching the goal without falling into holes.

Perhaps setting params[14] (state 14) to move right (action 0) or down (action 3). Similarly, state 12 might benefit from moving right or down.

I need to avoid actions that could lead to holes. For example, certain states near the edges have higher risk of falling into water if not careful.

Maybe I can look at an optimal policy for a non-slippery version and adjust it for slipperiness by making sure each action's possible moves are safe or lead towards the goal.

Alternatively, think about how to reach the goal in as few steps as possible while minimizing hole risks. The shortest path is from 0 -> 1 -> ... -> 3 ->7->11->15, but considering slipperiness, it's better to have a policy that generally moves right and down.

But given the slippery nature, perhaps setting each state to move in directions that, on average, would take it closer to the goal. For example, state 0 might choose to move right or down, but since the environment is probabilistic, any action could lead in different ways.

Another approach is to have all states near the top and left move towards the bottom-right as much as possible. So, for each state, choosing actions that maximize movement towards the goal.

But without knowing where the holes are exactly (since they aren't specified except through trajectories), I need to infer based on previous attempts which paths lead to failures.

From the provided trajectories, some agents fall into loops or get stuck near the top-left. So maybe certain states in the upper left have high risks of falling into holes if not navigated properly.

Perhaps setting params for these states (like 0,1,2,3) to move towards the right and down more often would help.

I should also ensure that once the agent reaches a state near the goal, it can get there without slipping back. For example, state 12 should have actions that don't risk moving left or up if those are hole positions.

Since I'm acting as an Explorer now, I'll try to change several parameters significantly from previous attempts. Let's see some of the top params had certain patterns; maybe flipping some actions in critical states could lead to better performance.

For example, if state 0 was previously set to action 1 (right), perhaps changing it to action 2 (up) might help avoid a hole that's below or something. Alternatively, choosing a different direction altogether.

I need to create a params array where each state's action is chosen carefully to move towards the goal while considering possible slips and avoiding holes.

Let me try constructing such an array step by step:

- Start with states 0: Maybe action 1 (right) or 3 (down). Let's pick action 1.
- State 1: Perhaps action 3 (down), but maybe action 0 (left) is risky if there's a hole. Or action 2? Not sure, let's set to 3.
- Continue this way for each state, trying to push towards the goal.

Alternatively, looking up standard solutions for FrozenLake with slipperiness, optimal policies often involve moving towards the goal as much as possible, but accounting for the possible slips by making sure that even if you slip, you don't end up in a hole.

But without knowing the exact positions of the holes, it's challenging. However, from the trajectories provided, I can infer which states are leading to holes.

For example, state 0 with action 1 leads to (4,3), but in one trajectory, that led to falling into a hole. So perhaps changing params[0] from 1 to another action might help.

Alternatively, maybe set params[0] to 2 or 3 to avoid certain paths.

Wait, I should think about the possible next states for each action:

Each action has three possible moves with equal probability. For example, action 0 (left) can lead to down, left, up. So for each state and action, we need to consider all possible transitions.

To maximize reward, the policy should choose actions that, on average, have the highest chance of reaching the goal without hitting a hole.

But since I don't know where the holes are exactly, perhaps I can make educated guesses based on trajectories.

Looking at the first top params:

params[0]:1 leads to (4,3) which is state 7. But in some cases, that trajectory ended in a fall into a hole, so maybe action 1 from state 0 isn't safe.

Perhaps setting params[0] to 2 would lead elsewhere. Action 2 from state 0 could move up, right, or down. So possible states: from state 0 (which is at top-left corner), moving up would stay in the same row? Or maybe it's out of bounds and treated as a hole.

Wait, the grid is 4x4, so moving up from state 0 might lead to a hole since it's the top row. So action 2 for state 0 (moving up) could be risky. Similarly, action 0 (left) would also be risky if that leads out of bounds.

So maybe for state 0, the safest actions are down or right.

But considering the slipperiness, choosing an action that when slipped, doesn't lead to a hole is crucial.

Suppose I set params[0] = 1 (right). If from state 0, moving right goes to state 1. Moving down from state 0 would go to state 4. But if the agent slips and moves left or up, which might be holes.

Alternatively, maybe setting params[0] to 3 (down) is better because it's more towards the goal, but I'm not sure about the slip effects.

Given that in previous attempts, moving right from state 0 led to issues, perhaps switching to down might help. Let me tentatively set params[0] = 3.

Similarly, for other states, try to move towards the goal while avoiding edges where slipping could lead to holes.

This process would require checking each state and choosing actions that have a higher chance of leading towards the goal without risking falling into holes. However, since I'm acting as an Explorer, I'll need to make changes from previous policies to gather more information.

I think for iteration 967, I should propose a params array where several key states have different actions than before, especially in areas where previous attempts led to low rewards or quick falls into holes.
