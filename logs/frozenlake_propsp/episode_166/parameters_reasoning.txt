You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment with the slippery action probabilities. The goal is to reach state 15, which is the bottom right corner, and get as many rewards as possible. The agent starts at state 0 and has to navigate around a hole (state 9) in the grid.

First, I remember that the policy parameter array 'params' contains values from 0 to 3, each representing an action. Each value corresponds to one of the four actions: moving down (0), right (1), up (2), left (3). The initial parameters are all set to 1.0, which means they should be explored further to find better actions.

The environment is slippery, meaning when an action is taken, there's a 25% chance of each possible direction being chosen instead of the selected action. This makes it harder because sometimes the agent might explore other areas even if they are away from the goal.

I need to look at the examples provided and see how different parameters affect the trajectory. For instance, in one example, params[0] is 2, which means when on state 0 (top-left), action 2 is taken. This would likely involve some exploration around the hole, which could help avoid getting stuck.

Looking at the most recent examples, there are some that have a lot of 3s and 1s. For example, params[0]:1, params[1]:1, etc., suggest a more stable or safer path. But others seem to be more random or with higher values, which might lead to immediate movement away from the hole.

I also notice that some policies have all actions set to 2, which is moving up. That's probably too aggressive because it could risk falling into the hole quickly if someone else steps on it. However, in other examples, sometimes action 0 (down) is used more often when the agent is near the top right.

Considering all this, I think a good strategy would involve some balance between exploiting the known paths and exploring areas around holes to find safer routes. Maybe starting with moderate values and then adjusting based on how the policy performs in different states could help. Also, since the environment is slippery, it's crucial not to take immediate risks but to try new actions when possible.

I should also be cautious about getting stuck in the hole (state 9). So, whenever near state 9, I might need to prioritize moving away instead of immediately taking any action. But without a clear path, using an exploratory policy like the recent examples with some 2s and others being higher could help explore different paths before focusing on the most promising ones.

In summary, my approach should involve experimenting with various parameter values, observing how each affects the agent's exploration and exploitation, and refining based on performance. Since all parameters start at 1, I might need to run a few iterations of testing these values to see which gives better rewards.
