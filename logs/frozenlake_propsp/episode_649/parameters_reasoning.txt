You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, let's try to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. So, from what I understand, it's a 4x4 grid where the agent can move in four directions, but because of the slippery nature, each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability. The goal is state 15 (the bottom-right corner), and there are holes that end the episode if stepped on.

First, I need to identify which states are holes. But from the given trajectories, I can see some paths leading to falls or successes. For example, in the most recent params, some trajectories loop endlessly without reaching the goal, suggesting those policies might be stuck or hitting holes.

The top-performing params have an average reward around 0.35, which is lower than the optimal 1.0. That suggests there's room for improvement. Maybe these policies aren't efficiently navigating towards state 15 or are falling into holes too often.

Looking at the recent params provided:
- The first recent param had all actions set to either 1 or 3, but the trajectory showed getting stuck in a loop.
- Another recent param tried some changes, but still ended up not reaching the goal.
- The last one had more varied actions, but it also didn't perform well.

I think the key is to find a policy that directs towards state 15 while avoiding holes. Maybe I should focus on states near the bottom-right corner and ensure they choose actions leading directly there or have high probabilities of reaching it without falling into holes.

For instance, state 12 (bottom-left) might benefit from moving right or down, but since it's already in the bottom row, maybe right is better. Similarly, state 14 (second from bottom-right) should move right to reach 15.

But I need to ensure that other states don't lead into holes. For example, state 0 (top-left) might be risky if it moves down because of the slippery nature. Perhaps choosing actions that have a higher chance of moving towards the goal without hitting holes is better.

Wait, but each action has three possible outcomes. So even if the policy suggests moving right from state 0, there's a chance it could move left, up, or down. That means the policy needs to be robust enough that even with these probabilistic moves, it can still reach the goal without falling into holes most of the time.

Maybe I should look at the optimal paths and see which actions would lead towards the goal from each state. For example:
- From state 14 (which is (3,2)), moving right goes to 15.
- From state 13 (3,1), moving down or right might be better.
- From state 10 (2,2), moving right or down would help.

But I'm not sure about the exact hole positions. The trajectories provided show that some paths lead to falling, like in the third recent param where the agent fell into a hole quickly. So, perhaps certain states have holes that need to be avoided.

I think it's crucial to structure the policy such that each state has an action that maximizes the probability of moving towards the goal while minimizing the risk of hitting a hole. Maybe some states should choose actions that have a higher chance of avoiding known holes.

Looking back at the top-performing policies, they seem to have varied actions but still aren't reaching the optimal reward. Perhaps tweaking certain states' actions could lead to better performance. For example, increasing the number of right and down moves in states closer to the goal might help.

Also, considering that each action has three possible outcomes, maybe the policy should encourage actions that have at least one safe path towards the goal. That way, even if two options are risky (like moving into a hole), the third option can lead safely forward.

In summary, I'll try adjusting the actions for key states like those near the goal and ensure that from each state, there's a reasonable chance to move towards the goal without hitting holes. This might involve setting certain states to always choose right or down when possible.
