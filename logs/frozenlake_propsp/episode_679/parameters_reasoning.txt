You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15, which gives a reward of +1, and avoid the holes that end the episode. The agent moves in a slippery way where each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability.

First, I need to understand the grid layout. It's a 4x4 grid, so states 0-3 are the top row (left to right), 4-7 the second row, 8-11 the third, and 12-15 the bottom row. The agent starts at state 0.

The policy is an array of 16 numbers where each index represents the action taken from that state. Actions are 0 (left, down, up), 1 (right, down, left), 2 (up, right, down), and 3 (left, up, right). Each action has three possible outcomes.

The key here is to find a policy that avoids holes while maximizing the chance of reaching state 15. From the examples provided, I notice that some policies are getting rewards around 0.25-0.35, which is below the optimal 1.0. So, we need to improve this.

Looking at the trajectories, it seems that some paths lead to loops or falling into holes. For example, a trajectory like (0,3) leading to (1,3) and so on might be getting stuck in a loop or hitting a hole.

To maximize information gain, I should propose parameters that explore new areas without repeating previous attempts. Since the rewards are still low, I'm in "Explorer" mode, so I need to choose a configuration that hasn't been tried before.

I'll start by considering which states are near the goal and how to navigate there safely. State 15 is the bottom right corner, so to get there, the agent might want to move right or down from nearby states.

Let me think about each state:

- State 0 (top-left): Possible actions should try to move towards the goal without falling into holes.
- States along the top row (0-3) and first column (0,4,8,12) need careful handling since moving left or down might lead to edges or holes.

I'll hypothesize that from state 0, choosing action 1 (right, down, left) could help move towards the goal. From other states near the top-left, similar logic applies.

But wait, looking at previous attempts, some policies with certain actions led to loops. So I should choose actions that avoid getting stuck in cycles.

I'll propose a new set of parameters where each state chooses an action that generally moves towards the right or down but has enough variety to explore different paths and avoid holes.

Let me draft a possible params array:

params[0]: 1 (action 1 from state 0)
... continue for all states, ensuring no repetition with previous policies.

params[0]: 2, params[1]: 3, params[2]: 1, params[3]: 2, params[4]: 3, params[5]: 0, params[6]: 2, params[7]: 1, params[8]: 0, params[9]: 3, params[10]: 2, params[11]: 1, params[12]: 3, params[13]: 0, params[14]: 2, params[15]: 3
