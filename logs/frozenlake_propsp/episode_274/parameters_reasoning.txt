You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment with slippery ice and holes. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) while avoiding the holes. Since the agent's actions are probabilistic, I need a strategy that maximizes the chance of reaching the goal without falling into any holes.

Looking at the previous examples provided, most policies have low rewards around 0.15 or even 0. The best so far is 0.25, which isn't very high. That suggests that either the current policies aren't good at avoiding holes or they're not efficiently navigating towards the goal.

I remember that in such grid worlds, the optimal path usually heads directly toward the goal, moving right and down as much as possible. But because of the slipperiness, each action can lead to three different directions with equal probability. So, I need to choose actions that, on average, push the agent closer to the goal while minimizing the risk of stepping into a hole.

I also note that some states are holes. From the trajectories provided, it seems like certain states are dangerous. For example, state 1 (0,1) might be a hole because when the policy takes action 1, it leads to falling into a hole quickly. Similarly, other states like 3 or 5 could be risky.

So, my approach is to design a policy that avoids these holes by choosing actions that lead away from them and towards safe paths. For each state, I need to select an action that maximizes the probability of moving closer to the goal without stepping into a hole.

Let me try to outline the optimal strategy for each state:

1. **State 0 (0,0)**: To move right or down. Since from here, moving right leads towards state 1, which might be a hole. Alternatively, moving down is safer as it goes to state 4, which is in the second row.

2. **State 1 (0,1)**: This seems risky. Maybe moving down is better to go to state 5 instead of staying or moving left/right which could lead into a hole.

3. **State 2 (0,2)**: Similar logic, perhaps move down to state 6.

4. **State 3 (0,3)**: Moving down to state 7 might be safer than other options.

5. **States in the second row (4-7)**: From here, moving right or down towards the goal is better. For example, state 4 can move right to 5 or down to 8.

6. **States in the third row (8-11)**: Here, moving right towards states closer to 12-15 and then down when possible.

7. **States in the bottom row (12-15)**: From here, moving right until reaching state 15.

But since each action has a 1/3 chance of going three different ways, I need to choose actions that have a high probability of avoiding holes and progressing towards the goal.

Looking at the previous policies, some are getting stuck or falling into holes quickly. Maybe adjusting certain states' actions could help. For example, in state 0, if we take action 2 (up), but since it's on the top row, moving up would keep it in place. Alternatively, taking action 1 might lead to different directions.

Wait, no, from state 0, action 0 is [down, left, up], so down leads to 4, left stays at 0, and up also can't go anywhere else. So maybe for state 0, choosing action 0 (which includes moving down) would be better as it has a chance to move down.

Similarly, in state 1, which is (0,1), the possible actions are [right, down, left]. Right leads to state 2, down to 5, and left back to 0. If I set the policy for state 1 to action 1 (down), that would have a chance to move to state 5, which is safer.

Continuing this logic for each state, trying to move towards the goal while avoiding known holes.

I think the best approach now is to propose a new parameter configuration that differs from previous ones. Since most policies are getting low rewards, I need to try something different to explore more effectively. Maybe focusing on states near the edges or adjusting certain key states' actions could lead to higher rewards.

After considering all this, here's a proposed set of parameters that avoids known holes and directs towards the goal:
</think>

params[0]: 1, params[1]: 1, params[2]: 3, params[3]: 2, params[4]: 3, params[5]: 3, params[6]: 0, params[7]: 3, params[8]: 2, params[9]: 3, params[10]: 0, params[11]: 2, params[12]: 1, params[13]: 3, params[14]: 1, params[15]: 2

This configuration aims to guide the agent towards the goal while avoiding dangerous states by adjusting key actions in critical positions.
