You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the next set of parameters for the FrozenLake environment to help maximize the episodic reward. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right corner) with a +1 reward, avoiding holes along the way.

From the history provided, I can see that most policies are getting around 0.05 to 0.45 average rewards over 20 episodes. That's significantly below the target of 1.0, so I need to explore more rather than exploit what's working slightly better. The agent is not consistently reaching the goal, which suggests it's either falling into holes or getting stuck in loops.

Looking at the recent policies, many have params[0] set to 2 or 3, and others vary. Since the environment is slippery, the actions don't always lead directly where intended. So I need to choose actions that give a higher probability of moving towards the goal without risking falling into holes.

I notice that in some top-performing policies, certain states like 0 (top-left) are set to action 1 or 2, which might help move right or down more often. However, since movement is probabilistic, I need to ensure that the chosen actions don't lead to states with holes when any of their possible moves are attempted.

I should consider setting the starting state (0) to an action that has a higher chance of moving towards the goal without immediately risking a hole. Maybe action 1 for state 0, which allows movement right, down, or left. But since it's slippery, choosing actions that have a path towards the goal with some redundancy.

Looking at other states, perhaps I should set key positions like state 8 (top of third row) to move up, but wait, in this setup, state 8 is actually the first cell of the third row, which might be closer to the goal. So maybe setting it to move right or down towards the goal.

I also need to avoid getting stuck in loops. For example, if the policy leads the agent back to the same state repeatedly without making progress, that's bad. So I should ensure that each state has a mix of actions that can lead to progression.

Since the environment is 4x4, from any given position, moving towards the right or down might be better, but again considering slipperiness. Maybe choosing for certain states to prefer right and others to prefer down.

I think I'll start by setting key positions near the goal (like state 12-15) to have actions that push towards the goal. For example, state 12 should move right or up if possible. But since movement is probabilistic, it's a balance between exploration and exploitation.

After considering all this, I'll propose a new set of parameters that shifts some key states' actions towards more goal-oriented directions while ensuring they don't lead into holes based on the trajectories observed so far.
