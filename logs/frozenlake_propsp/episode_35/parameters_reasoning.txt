You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help optimize a policy for the FrozenLake environment using the given setup. Let me break down what's going on here.

First, the environment is a 4x4 grid with states numbered from 0 to 15. The goal is state 15, and there are holes that cause the episode to end if the agent steps into them. The policy is defined by an array of 16 actions (each from 0-3), where each index corresponds to a state's action.

The problem mentions that the environment is slippery, so when the agent takes an action, it can move in one of three directions with equal probability. This adds uncertainty because even if the agent chooses an action, it might not end up where it intended. The challenge is to find the optimal policy (params array) that maximizes the average reward over 20 episodes.

Looking at the interaction steps, I realize that each iteration involves proposing a new set of params, and then receiving feedback on its performance based on the average reward. Since we're limited to MAX_ITERATIONS of 5000, efficiency is key.

The user provided some top-performing params and their trajectories, but all had low rewards (around 0.05). This suggests that the current policies aren't performing well enough, so I need to explore more effectively.

Given that the optimal reward should be around 1.0, which implies reaching state 15 reliably, I need to focus on creating a policy that avoids holes and navigates efficiently towards the goal.

I notice that in previous attempts, the trajectories often involve getting stuck or falling into loops (like staying in state 0). So, perhaps adjusting certain states' actions can help break these loops and move towards the goal more effectively.

For example, if an agent is in a state near the edges, choosing actions that push it towards the goal might be better. Also, considering how the slippery nature affects movement, I should ensure that each action choice increases the probability of moving closer to the goal without falling into holes.

I'll start by looking at some key states:
- State 0 (top-left corner): Possible moves are down or right, but since it's slippery, maybe choosing an action that can move towards either direction.
- States near the bottom-right (like 12, 13, 14) should prioritize moving right or down to reach state 15.

I need to create a params array where each state selects an action that, on average, moves it closer to state 15 while avoiding holes. This might involve choosing actions that have the highest probability of moving towards the goal, considering all possible movement outcomes due to slipperiness.

Let me try to define some general rules for each state:
- For states in the top row (0-3), prefer right or down movements.
- For states in the bottom row except 15, prefer right if possible.
- For leftmost column (states 0,4,8,12), prefer down unless it's already in the bottom row.

But since each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability, I need to ensure that for each state and chosen action, at least one of the possible outcomes is a step towards the goal without falling into a hole.

I'll sketch out some tentative params based on these rules. For example:
- State 0: Action 1 (which allows moving right, down, or left). But maybe action 3 would be better for movement options.
Wait, let me check what each action does when taken from a state:

For any state s, taking action 0 leads to [down, left, up], action 1 leads to [right, down, left], action 2 leads to [up, right, down], and action 3 leads to [left, up, right].

So for state 0 (top-left corner), if the agent takes action 1, it can move right (to state 1) or down (to state 4). Left would take it back, but since it's at 0, moving left isn't possible in a 4x4 grid—so perhaps the movement wraps around or stays? Wait, no, in FrozenLake, I think moving into walls keeps you in place. So from state 0 (row 0, column 0), action 1 would have right to state 1, down to state 4, and left stays at 0.

So taking action 1 from state 0 gives a chance to move right or down, which are good directions towards the goal.

Similarly, for other states. Let me try to define each params[i] based on maximizing progress toward state 15 while avoiding holes.

Looking back, in the previous attempts, the agent often gets stuck or loops. So perhaps we need a more dynamic policy that adapts based on the environment's structure.

Since I'm supposed to propose a new set of params without repeating any from the buffer and considering all constraints, I'll try to define each state's action step by step, ensuring it moves towards the goal and avoids holes as much as possible.
