You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment using a neural network-based policy gradient method. The user provided some specific parameters and wants me to choose the best action values from [0, 1, 2, 3] for each state based on their performance.

First, let me recall how the policy is represented. Each state (from 0 to 15) corresponds to a parameter in the 'params' array. These parameters determine the probability distribution over actions when the agent is at that state. 

The user mentioned that the global optimal reward should be around None if it's not found, and exploration needs to continue until this point. They've provided some top-performing param sets with their rewards, but I need to find a parameter set that might yield higher rewards than those.

Looking at the examples given, one has an f(params) of 0.35, another 0.25, and so on. The best recent example is params[0]=2, [1]=2, etc., which gives 0 reward in their latest trials. 

I think I should look for parameters that lead the agent to explore more of the environment without getting stuck in local optima. This might mean choosing actions that are safer or less likely to fall into holes.

Wait, but all the examples provided have rewards around 0, which suggests they're not successful yet. Maybe I need to try parameters that could make the agent take more deliberate turns and avoid hard steps.

Let me consider some action choices:
- Action 2 (up): Takes directions up, left, down with equal probability.
- Action 3 (left): Tries left or none, but it might be risky if moving left from certain states leads to a hole.

Maybe starting by trying actions that are less obvious could help the agent discover better paths. So, perhaps using parameters where taking action 0 is more likely when possible, avoiding immediate hard steps.

Alternatively, I could consider randomizing the actions in such a way that the policy doesn't prematurely fixate on certain behaviors. Maybe some balance between exploring and exploiting.

After trying these options, I think an initial set with a slight mix of different actions would be good. For example:
- Action 0 when at state 0.
- Action 2 and 3 otherwise.

So, params[0]=1, params[1]=1 (since action 2 is for up or left), params[2]=0.5 (action up), etc. This should encourage the agent to take more random actions where needed.

I need to make sure these parameters aren't too extreme in any state, as that could lead to getting stuck near holes.
