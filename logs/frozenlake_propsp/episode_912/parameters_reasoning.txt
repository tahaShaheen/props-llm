You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 912 out of 5000. OUTPUT ONLY THIS SINGLE LINE:

Do NOT output anything else. No explanation, no reasoning, nothing.



LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me try to understand the problem first.

The environment is a 4x4 grid where each state can transition probabilistically because of the slippery nature. The goal is state 15 (bottom right), which gives +1 reward, and other states give 0. There are holes that end the episode if stepped on, but I don't know exactly where they are.

The policy is an array of 16 numbers, each being 0-3, representing actions for each state. The challenge is to find the optimal policy without remembering previous attempts—so I need a strategy that maximizes information gain each time.

Looking at the top params provided, most have f(params) around 0.45, which is below the target of 1.0. That suggests we're still in the exploration phase because rewards are far from optimal. So, as an Explorer, I should propose a new set of params that's different from previous ones to gather more information about the environment.

I need to make sure each state's action doesn't lead into a hole based on past trajectories. For example, some states led to falling into holes or getting stuck in loops. So, for each state, choosing an action that avoids these pitfalls is crucial.

Let me think about each state:

- State 0 (top left): Previous params had actions like 1 and 2. Maybe trying a different action here could help avoid traps.
- States near the edges might have higher risks of falling into holes, so their policies should prioritize safe moves towards the goal.

I'll start by changing some actions in states that previously led to low rewards or got stuck. For example, if state 0 was taking action 1, maybe try action 2 instead. Similarly, check other states and see where diversifying could help gather new information about their transitions.

Since I can't remember past params, each suggestion must be novel. So, looking at the most recent params, which had lower rewards, I should deviate from those to explore new paths.

I think setting some actions towards moving right or down more might help in reaching state 15 faster. Also, avoiding getting stuck in loops by ensuring that when an action is taken, it doesn't lead back to a previous state too often.

So, putting this together, I'll create a new params array where each state's action is chosen to potentially explore different paths and avoid known traps from the trajectories provided.
