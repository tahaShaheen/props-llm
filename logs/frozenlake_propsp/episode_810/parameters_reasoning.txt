You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, I'm trying to find the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment described here. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward, which should ideally be around 1.0 when the agent reaches state 15 (the bottom-right corner). 

First, let me understand the environment setup. It's a 4x4 grid with states numbered from 0 to 15. Each state corresponds to a specific cell in the grid. The movement actions have some randomness because of the slippery nature of the environment. For each action taken by the agent, there are three possible directions it could move, each with equal probability.

The main challenge here is figuring out which states are holes since they aren't explicitly mentioned. From the trajectories provided, I can infer that certain states lead to falls or termination. For example, in one of the top-performing params, the trajectory was (0,1) → (4,2) → (8,2), and then presumably fell into a hole because the reward wasn't 1. So, state 8 might be a hole? Or maybe it's not, but perhaps state 5 or 6 is.

Looking at the most recent params, I see that some trajectories are getting stuck in loops or moving in circles without reaching the goal. This suggests that the current policies aren't efficiently navigating towards the goal, possibly due to not avoiding holes correctly.

I need to design a policy where each state (params[i]) has an action that maximizes the chance of reaching state 15 while avoiding any holes. Since the environment is slippery, the agent's movement isn't straightforward. So, I should choose actions that increase the probability of moving towards the goal despite the randomness.

For instance, in the top-left corner (state 0), choosing an action that generally moves right or down would help. But considering the possible slip directions, each action has a 1/3 chance to go in any of three directions. So, I need to pick actions that statistically lead towards state 15.

Looking at previous attempts, some policies are getting stuck in loops or moving away from the goal. Maybe adjusting the actions for certain states could help. For example, if a policy is taking an action that sometimes moves it into a hole, changing that action might prevent the fall and allow progress towards the goal.

I also notice that the best-performing params have some success but aren't reaching the maximum reward of 1.0 consistently. So, perhaps tweaking certain states' actions could lead to better performance.

Another approach is to consider the structure of the grid and plan a path from each state to the goal, considering the possible movements due to slipping. For example, for state 12 (bottom-left), moving right would take it to state 13 or 14, which are closer to the goal. So, setting params[12] to action 0 might help.

Wait, but in the given environment description, each action has specific possible movements. For example, action 0 can lead to down, left, or up. So, I need to map each state's action to the best possible outcome considering all three possibilities.

I should probably create a grid and mark which states are holes based on previous trajectories. From the given examples, it seems that some states like 8 might be safe, but others like 5 or 6 could be holes. Alternatively, maybe certain transitions from actions lead to termination, so I need to avoid those.

Let me try to map out possible paths. Starting from state 0 (top-left), moving right would take the agent to state 1, but due to slipping, it might go down instead. So, action 1 for state 0 could help in moving towards the goal more often than not.

Looking at the recent params where the reward was 0.10, the trajectory went from (0,3) through several steps and ended without reaching the goal. Maybe adjusting the actions for states near the bottom-right would help.

I think I need to systematically go through each state and decide which action would statistically give the highest chance of moving closer to the goal while avoiding known holes or risky moves.

For example:
- State 0 (top-left): Choosing action 1 might move it right, down, or left. Moving right is towards the goal, so action 1.
- State 1: Action 3 could move up, right, or down. Right would help, so action 3.
- State 2: Maybe action 0 to go down, which is towards the bottom.
- And so on for each state.

But I need to ensure that these actions don't lead into holes. From previous trajectories, some states might be risky, so I should adjust accordingly.

After considering all this, I'll propose a new set of params where each state's action is chosen to maximize progress towards the goal while avoiding any known dangerous moves.
