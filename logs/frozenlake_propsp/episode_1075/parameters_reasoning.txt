You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, let's try to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. So, from what I understand, it's a 4x4 grid where the agent can move in four directions, but because of the slippery nature, each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability. The goal is state 15, which gives +1 reward, and there are some holes that end the episode.

First, I need to identify the hole positions. From the trajectories provided, it looks like certain states are leading to failures. For example, in one of the recent trials, the agent went from state 0 (top-left) to state 4 (which is the second cell in the second row). Then, moving to state 8 and so on. It seems that some transitions are causing the agent to fall into holes.

Looking at the top-performing policies, they have reward around 0.35 to 0.45. That's below 1, which is the target. So, maybe I'm not yet exploiting optimally. The recent trials have lower rewards, like 0.2 and even 0.05, which suggests that some parameters are leading to more failures.

I should consider how each state's action affects the chances of reaching the goal without hitting a hole. For example, states near the edges might be riskier because certain actions could lead into holes. So, for those states, choosing actions that have a higher probability of moving towards safe zones would be better.

In the recent parameters, I notice some patterns. For instance, in state 0 (params[0]), sometimes action 1 is chosen, which moves the agent either right, down, or left with equal chance. But if moving left from state 0 leads to a hole, then that could be problematic. So, perhaps choosing an action that doesn't allow moving into known holes would help.

Looking at the trajectories, when the agent takes certain actions from state 0, it ends up in state 4 or other states, which might be safe or not. For example, if from state 0 taking action 2 (up) isn't possible because it's already on the top row, so maybe that leads to moving down instead. But I'm not entirely sure about all hole positions.

Another approach is to structure the policy in a way that guides the agent towards the goal while avoiding risky moves. For states closer to the goal, like state 12 (which is near the bottom-right), choosing actions that move right or down might be better. But considering the slippery nature, those actions can lead to three possible moves.

I think I need to adjust the policy for certain key states. For example, in state 0, maybe action 1 is good because it allows moving right, which could take the agent towards the goal without immediately putting it into a hole. Similarly, for other edge states, choosing actions that have a higher chance of moving towards the center or directly towards the goal might be better.

I also need to ensure that I'm not repeating parameters from previous iterations. The problem statement says to avoid previously seen params, so each suggestion should be unique unless it's an optimization step when rewards are close to 1.0.

Given that the current best reward is around 0.45, which is still below 1.0, I might need to explore more to find a better policy. So, perhaps changing some of the parameters for states near the edges or in positions that often lead to holes would help.

I should also consider the transitions more carefully. For each state and action, what are the possible next states? If an action from a particular state has a high probability of leading to a hole, then I should choose a different action for that state.

For example, if taking action 3 (left) from state 1 leads into a hole, then in params[1], I shouldn't set it to 3. Instead, maybe choosing an action that moves down or right would be better, depending on the surroundings.

Another thing is that some states might have multiple holes around them, so the policy needs to navigate carefully. It's crucial to choose actions that minimize the risk of falling into a hole while maximizing the chance of reaching the goal.

Perhaps I can structure the policy in a way that creates a path towards the goal by always moving right or down when possible. But considering the slippery nature, it's more about controlling the probabilities rather than exact moves.

I think I should focus on modifying parameters for states where the current policy is leading to failures. For instance, looking at recent trajectories where the reward was low, identify which actions were taken and adjust those accordingly.

In summary, my approach would be:

1. Identify hole positions by analyzing previous trajectories.
2. Adjust the policy for each state to choose actions that avoid these holes.
3. Ensure a path towards the goal by guiding the agent in the right direction.
4. Avoid repeating previous parameter configurations unless optimizing near the target reward.

Now, based on this reasoning, I'll propose a new set of parameters that should help the agent navigate more effectively towards the goal while avoiding holes.
