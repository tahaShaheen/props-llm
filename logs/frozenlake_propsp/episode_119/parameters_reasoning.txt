You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get an episodic reward of around 1.0, which means reaching state 15 without falling into any holes. 

Looking at the problem description, the environment is a 4x4 grid with slippery movement. Each action has a 33% chance of moving in one of three directions. The policy needs to be robust enough to avoid the holes while navigating towards the goal.

From the provided data, I can see that most policies have low rewards (around 0.15 or less). This suggests that the current strategies aren't efficiently reaching the goal or are getting stuck or falling into holes too often. 

The recent parameters tried include several that cycle through different actions but haven't yielded high rewards. For example, many of the top-performing params have a mix of actions like 1s and 3s, but they still only achieve around 0.15 reward on average.

Since the goal is to reach state 15, I need to focus on creating paths that move the agent towards the southeast corner (state 15). Considering the slippery nature, each action might not take the agent directly where intended, so the policy should account for that by increasing the likelihood of moving in the correct general direction.

I notice that some states near the goal have higher rewards. Maybe adjusting their actions to push more towards the right and down could help. For example, state 14 (which is just left of 15) should probably always try to move right to reach 15. Similarly, states above 15 (like 12, 13) might benefit from moving down.

Looking at the recent params, I see that many are cycling through actions like 0,1,2,3 without a clear direction. Maybe focusing on specific actions for certain states could help. For instance, setting some states to always move right or down to push towards the goal more directly.

I should also consider avoiding holes by ensuring that from any state, the chosen action doesn't lead into a hole with high probability. This might mean choosing actions that have a higher chance of moving away from known hole positions.

Perhaps testing a policy where states closer to the goal prioritize right and down movements. For example, in state 12 (which is row 3, column 0), moving right would take it to 13, which is better than other options. Similarly, state 13 should move down to reach 15, but since movement is probabilistic, choosing actions that increase the chance of moving towards the goal.

Given the current low rewards, maybe I need to try a more aggressive approach, focusing on specific paths that are less likely to lead into holes. For example, creating corridors where possible by ensuring that from certain states, the agent moves in directions that don't risk falling into holes.

I should also look at the trajectories provided. The top-performing ones end quickly but with low rewards, suggesting they either fall into holes or don't reach the goal effectively. I need to find a policy that can navigate more efficiently without getting stuck.

In summary, my approach would be:

1. Identify states near the goal and set their actions to prioritize moving towards the goal (right for even columns, down for rows).
2. For other states, choose actions that generally move the agent closer to the goal, considering the slippery nature.
3. Avoid actions that lead into known hole positions by testing different action sequences.

Based on this, I'll propose a new set of params where key states are directed towards the goal and others follow a path that avoids holes while progressing towards the target.
