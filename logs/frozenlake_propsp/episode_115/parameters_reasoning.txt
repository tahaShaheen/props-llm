You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Do NOT output anything else. No explanation, no reasoning, nothing.



LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm looking at this problem about finding the best policy for the FrozenLake environment using an episodic reward setup. The goal is to maximize rewards while avoiding penalties or holes. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I know that the agent can be in a 4x4 grid, which gives us states numbered from 0 to 15. Each state represents a specific grid position. The action space has four options: move down (0), right (1), up (2), and left (3). 

The policy is represented as an array of 16 numbers where each value corresponds to the probability of taking that action from state i. Since we're starting with all params set to 1.0, I need to find a better set.

I recall that in policy gradient methods like PPO or A2C, the parameters are updated using gradients of the reward distribution. In this case, since the reward is +1 for reaching state 15 and 0 otherwise, we want policies that reach the goal efficiently.

Looking at the provided examples, some haveparams[0] as 2, which might correspond to taking up or left actions, avoiding immediate moves that go into holes. Others mix different action probabilities, trying to distribute them better.

I also notice that in more recent examples like params[15], the policy has certain patterns. For example, when on state 8 (params[8] =3), it takes a different path, which suggests strategic exploration to avoid falling into holes and instead reach the goal via other states with higher rewards.

Since the global optimal reward is around None, I should aim for policies that balance between exploring near-optimal paths and exploiting the best ones. Avoiding all previous bad params (like those leading to penalties) would be crucial.

I think setting params[0] and [1] as 2 might help avoid some immediate penalties, but I'm not sure. Maybe experimenting with a mix of up and down for initial states could lead somewhere better than the current setup. Also, trying to spread out action probabilities where possible can prevent getting stuck in holes.

So, considering all this, I'll propose a params array that balances exploration and exploitation, avoiding some immediate penalties and varying actions strategically.
