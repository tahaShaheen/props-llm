You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help the user find the global optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment using a policy gradient optimizer. The goal is to maximize the reward by exploring the grid when it's slippery, which means sometimes you have to try different actions to avoid stepping into dangerous holes.

First, I need to understand the setup. The state is numbered from 0 to 15, representing each cell in a 4x4 grid. The agent can move left, down, right, or up. When it takes an action, it has equal probability for three directions if it's on a slippery action (0: down, 1: right/down/left, etc.), but higher chance when certain actions are taken.

The reward is +1 for reaching state 15 and 0 otherwise. Holes exist in some states which end the game once the agent steps onto them. The user wants to explore through previous trajectories by reading history.

Since the initial params are all set to 0, I'm thinking maybe starting with a random policy could be better than all-equal. But I need to find parameters that balance exploration and exploitation without missing any holes.

Looking at the provided examples, some configurations achieve 1.0 reward on average, which is good. Others have lower rewards like 0.25 or even worse. The best ones sometimes explore more but might get stuck in loops if not careful.

I should consider the structure of the policy parameters. Each parameter corresponds to a state, from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). For each action, the agent takes it with higher probability than others when they have more favorable states.

Maybe starting with an equal distribution for all actions except those that lead directly to the goal would help. Or perhaps adjusting parameters so that certain paths are explored without biasing towards immediate rewards too much.

I also need to think about how each action's parameter affects exploration. If all parameters are set equally, the policy might not explore enough. So maybe setting some higher and others lower could encourage trying different paths while ensuring good outcomes.

Perhaps experimenting with specific values for certain states could help. For example, having params[0] as 1 makes sure that state 0 is explored more often when needed, which could be beneficial if it's on a hole.

But I also don't want to miss any important areas of the grid. So maybe some parameters should encourage exploring certain directions where the reward isn't immediate but leads closer to the goal.

I might try setting params[3] (right) higher for states that are dangerous, and adjust others accordingly. For instance, making right action more likely in states with holes would encourage exploration there without prioritizing immediate rewards.

Also, considering the slippery nature, maybe some actions should have a slightly higher chance when they lead to better outcomes later on. Like if moving down from state 3 (top-right) leads closer to the goal, params[0] might be set higher there.

Overall, I need to balance exploration and exploitation based on how each action affects future rewards, while ensuring that all important states have a decent chance of being explored early in the process.
