You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Do NOT output anything else. No explanation, no reasoning, nothing.

<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to find the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment using the provided parameters. The goal is to reach state 15 with the highest possible reward. 

First, I remember that each action choice from 0 to 3 isn't fixed; instead, their values are determined by the parameters. Each parameter represents an action given a specific state index. For example, params[0] tells me which action (0-3) is taken when in state 0.

I know that the agent starts at a random state and needs to explore different paths. Since the environment is slippery, each action has equal probability, so sometimes the agent might take actions randomly or choose from multiple options equally.

The reward system gives +1 for reaching state 15 (the bottom right corner) and 0 otherwise. However, there are holes that end the game upon stepping on them. The policy should avoid these holes by exploring nearby states.

Looking at the examples provided, some parameters seem to target specific actions more often than others. For instance, params[0] being 2 means in state 0 (top-left), action 2 is chosen most of the time. Similarly, other parameter values influence which action is taken when.

I notice that using all 1s as parameters might lead to taking only one action, possibly leading to a cycle and not exploring enough areas. On the other hand, mixing different parameters allows for more exploration, potentially finding better paths towards the goal.

The maximum reward from the examples is around 0.20, which suggests that some optimal policies yield moderate rewards. However, higher rewards are possible if the agent can avoid holes or reach states with more favorable transitions.

Since each parameter choice affects the entire policy, I need to balance between exploring new paths and exploiting known good actions. If a parameter causes the action not to be taken in many states where it leads closer to the goal, that might lead to higher rewards.

I should test different combinations of parameters to see which ones result in better average rewards over time. It's important to consider the interactions between each state-action pair since moving from one state affects all possible transitions.
