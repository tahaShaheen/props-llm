You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The environment is a 4x4 grid with states numbered from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). The goal is to reach state 15, which gives +1 reward, but there are holes that end the episode if stepped on. Because it's slippery, each action has three possible outcomes with equal probability.

The policy is a function mapping each state to an action (0-3), and we need to find the global optimal policy that maximizes the average episodic reward over 20 episodes. The challenge is to propose different params without repeating any previous ones, aiming for a reward close to 1.0.

Looking at the top-performing params provided, most have low rewards (around 0.15-0.25), so we're not very close to the optimal yet. The recent attempts also show low or zero rewards, indicating that current policies aren't effective in reaching the goal without falling into holes.

To maximize information gain, I should propose a policy that explores new areas of the state space. Maybe focus on states near the goal and see if they can reach it safely. Let's consider some key points:

1. **Avoid Holes**: Need to identify which states are holes and ensure policies avoid them. From the trajectories, it seems stepping into certain states leads to falling, but without knowing exact hole positions, I'll have to infer based on trajectories.

2. **Goal Approach**: For state 14 (second last in row 3), choosing an action that can lead to 15. Since movement is probabilistic, the best bet is to choose actions that increase the chance of moving right or down.

3. **State Transitions**: Each action from a state leads to three possible states with equal probability due to slipperiness. So for each state i, params[i] should be set such that one of the possible moves from it has a higher chance of leading towards 15 without hitting a hole.

4. **Exploration vs Exploitation**: Since current rewards are low, we're in "Explorer" mode. Need to choose a policy that explores different paths to gather more data on which actions lead closer to the goal or avoid holes.

Looking at previous params, many seem to cycle between certain actions without much variation. Maybe varying the actions more could help. For example, setting some states to move right and others down might create new trajectories that reach 15.

Let me think of a specific strategy: for states in row 3 (8-11), encourage moving right or down. For other rows, move towards increasing columns. Also, ensure that actions from near the goal help in reaching it.

I'll construct params where each state's action is chosen to either increase the column number or move closer to the bottom-right corner, avoiding states likely to be holes based on previous trajectories.

After considering these points, I'll propose a new set of params where for each state, the action is selected to maximize movement towards 15 while spreading out to cover different paths.
