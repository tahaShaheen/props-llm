You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get the agent to state 15 with as high a reward as possible, avoiding the holes. From the examples given, it seems like all the policies so far are giving low rewards around 0.15 or even 0.00. That's way below the target of 1.0, which suggests that there's room for improvement.

Looking at the top 8 best performing params, they all have a reward of 0.15. The trajectories show that sometimes the agent either falls into holes or takes a long time to reach the goal. For example, one trajectory goes from (0,3) and ends up in a hole after several steps. Another gets stuck in loops without reaching the goal.

I notice that many policies have similar patterns: moving right when possible, but perhaps not effectively navigating around the holes. The environment's slipperiness complicates things because actions can lead to unintended states with equal probability. So, the policy needs to be robust against these uncertainties.

The recent params tried didn't perform well—rewards were 0.00 for both. That indicates that those policies either fell into holes or got stuck in loops without reaching the goal. It's crucial to find a balance between exploration and exploitation, but since we're in an exploratory phase (as rewards are low), we should try diverse strategies.

I think I need to propose a policy that encourages moving towards the goal while avoiding known holes. Maybe prioritizing right and down movements where possible. Let me consider state 0 (top-left corner). If the agent is here, taking action 1 might help move it right or other directions. Similarly, for states closer to the goal, actions should be chosen to maximize the chance of moving towards 15.

Wait, but considering the slippery nature, each action has three possible outcomes. So, perhaps choosing actions that have a higher probability of leading towards the goal without risking falling into holes is key. For example, in state 0, action 1 could move right, down, or left. But since the hole is at (0,3), maybe avoiding moving left from certain states would help.

I should also look at known hole positions. From the trajectories provided, it seems like some holes are present on the edges. Maybe states 0, 2, 4, 6, etc., have holes. So, the policy needs to avoid actions that could lead into those.

Perhaps a good approach is to set policies that push the agent towards the goal (right and down) as much as possible, while also having contingency actions in case of slipping. For example, from state 0, choosing action 1 might allow movement right or down, both helpful directions.

Let me try constructing such a policy:

- For states near the top-left (0), move right or down.
- For middle states, continue moving towards the goal with actions that have a higher chance of progressing.
- Ensure that from any state, the chosen action doesn't risk going into a hole based on the observed trajectories.

Given the recent attempts didn't work well, I'll try a completely different approach. Maybe setting all policies to move right or down unless it's certain to fall into a hole. Let me map each state and decide the best possible action that avoids known holes and progresses towards 15.

After considering each state and their adjacent states with potential holes, I think the optimal policy might involve mostly moving right and down but adjusting when necessary to avoid holes. For example:

- State 0: Action 1 (right)
- State 1: Action 3 (right or up or something else)
Wait, need to be careful here.

Alternatively, perhaps using a more systematic approach by considering the possible transitions for each state. Since each action leads to three possible states with equal probability, choosing an action that maximizes the chance of moving towards the goal while minimizing the risk of falling into holes.

After some analysis, I'll propose a new set of params where most states take actions that push towards the right or down, adjusting when necessary based on observed hole positions. This should help in reaching the goal without falling into holes too often.
