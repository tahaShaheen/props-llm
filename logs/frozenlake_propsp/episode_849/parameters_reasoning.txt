You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy parameters for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with a +1 reward while avoiding holes. The agent moves in four directions but because of the slippery nature, each action leads to three possible next states with equal probability.

First, I need to understand how the params array works. Each index from 0 to 15 corresponds to a specific state, and the value at that index is the action taken when in that state. The actions are 0,1,2,3 which each map to three possible directions. 

Looking at the provided top 5 best performing params, I see they're all yielding around 0.45 to 0.25 rewards. That's significantly below the target of 1.0. So, I'm not yet close to the optimal policy.

The most recent parameters are also not doing well, with some even getting negative or zero rewards. This suggests that the current policies aren't effectively navigating towards the goal without falling into holes or getting stuck in loops.

Given that the environment is slippery and has holes, the key is to design a policy that avoids these holes while guiding the agent towards state 15. Since each action leads to three possible states, the policy must account for this uncertainty by choosing actions that statistically increase the chances of reaching the goal without hitting a hole.

I notice that in some top params, certain states are taking specific actions. For example, in state 0 (top-left corner), the best policies so far are using action 1 or 2. Action 1 from state 0 could lead to moving right, down, or left. But since moving left would take it out of bounds, perhaps that's not ideal.

Wait, actually, each action from a state doesn't necessarily stay within the grid. For instance, if you're in state 0 (top-left) and choose action 0 (which could be down, left, up), but left or up might lead to going out of the grid, which I think would result in staying in the same state or maybe ending the episode. But since it's a grid world, moving beyond the borders probably keeps you in place.

Alternatively, perhaps each action leads to three possible adjacent states with wrap-around or some other handling, but that's unclear. So, I need to be cautious about how actions translate to state transitions.

To maximize the chances of reaching state 15, the policy should encourage movement towards the right and down directions since the goal is at (3,3), which is the bottom-right corner. However, due to the slippery nature, each action might not lead directly to that direction every time.

Looking at state 0: from the top-left corner (0,0). The possible actions are:

- Action 0: down, left, up. But since it's on the edge, moving up or left might keep it in place or move it into a hole.
- Action 1: right, down, left. Moving right is towards state 1; moving down to state 4; left would stay at 0.

So, perhaps from state 0, choosing action 1 (right) is better because it increases the chance of moving towards the goal.

Similarly, for other states near the top-left, like state 1 and state 3, their actions should encourage movement towards the right or down.

Looking at some of the previous params, I see that in state 0, action 1 was used. Maybe this is a good start.

But considering the slippery nature, the policy must be robust enough to handle the probabilistic transitions without falling into holes. So, perhaps states near the bottom-right should have actions that directly aim for state 15, while others navigate towards it more cautiously.

Given the current best params are yielding around 0.45 reward, which is lower than expected, I need to try different configurations. Maybe some states aren't being handled optimally.

I should consider varying the actions in key states, especially those near the goal and those prone to falling into holes. For example, states that are one step away from a hole might need cautious policies.

Alternatively, since the environment is 4x4 with known holes, I might try to map out which states are safe and which lead to holes. But without knowing the exact locations of the holes, it's challenging. However, from the trajectories provided, it seems that certain actions from specific states lead to falling into holes or looping.

One approach is to design a policy that encourages movement towards state 15 while avoiding loops. For example, in states near the bottom row and right column, prioritize moving right or down as much as possible.

But due to the slippery nature, each action doesn't guarantee movement in that direction. So, perhaps choosing actions that have higher probability of moving towards the goal would be better.

Another thought is to use a greedy approach where each state chooses the action that maximizes the expected reward based on current knowledge. But since I don't have information about which states are holes, it's tricky.

Looking at the most recent params, some have very low rewards, so perhaps they're getting stuck in loops or falling into holes frequently. So, adjusting those states to choose different actions might help.

For example, in state 0: if previously using action 1 led to a loop or hole, maybe switching to action 2 (up, right, down) could help, as it increases the chance of moving up (which from state 0 would stay at 0) or right (to 1) or down (to 4). Alternatively, perhaps action 3 is better.

Wait, let's clarify the actions:

- Action 0: [down, left, up]
- Action 1: [right, down, left]
- Action 2: [up, right, down]
- Action 3: [left, up, right]

So, from state 0 (top-left), action 0 would try to move down, left, or up. But moving left or up might not be ideal as they could lead back to the same state or into a hole.

Action 1 would attempt right, which is good towards the goal; down to state 4; and left, which isn't helpful.

So maybe action 1 is better for state 0.

But in some previous params, using action 2 (which includes up, right, down) might sometimes move up, but from state 0, moving up would stay at state 0. That's not ideal, as it could lead to a loop.

Alternatively, perhaps action 3 is better for state 1 or other states near the top.

Wait, maybe in state 0, using action 2 or 3 could be beneficial because of their possible directions. But I'm not sure without knowing the exact hole positions.

Given that the current best reward is around 0.45, perhaps a more aggressive approach is needed. Maybe increasing the number of states that push towards the bottom-right and avoid risky moves.

I should also consider that each action from a state has three possible outcomes, so the policy needs to choose actions that statistically have higher chances of moving towards the goal without hitting holes.

Looking at the recent params, perhaps trying different combinations in key states like 0,1,3,4 could help. For example, setting state 0 to action 2 (up, right, down). From state 0, up would stay, but right and down are better. So maybe that's a good balance.

Alternatively, state 0 with action 3 (left, up, right) might sometimes move left, which isn't helpful, so perhaps action 1 is still better.

In any case, since the current policies aren't performing well, I should try new configurations to explore different trajectories and gather more data about which actions lead to success or failure.

So, for iteration 849, I need to propose a new set of params that hasn't been tried before, focusing on potentially improving the reward by adjusting key states' actions towards right and down directions.
