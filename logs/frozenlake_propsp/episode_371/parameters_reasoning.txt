You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to find the global optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment using an episodic reward function. The agent can take four actions, each with certain probabilities depending on the state it's in. The goal is to reach state 15 (right bottom grid) and avoid stepping into holes. 

The policy parameters are an array of size 16, where each element represents the action for a specific state from 0 to 15. Each parameter can be 0, 1, 2, or 3. The current approach is using a trial-and-error method with random exploration since I don't have prior knowledge about the optimal parameters.

First, I need to understand how the policy works. Each action corresponds to moving in a specific direction. When an action is taken from a state, the next state and reward are determined probabilistically. For example, if the current action is 0 (move down), the agent will choose among move down, left, or up with equal probability.

I realize that trying random values for the parameters might not be efficient. The optimal policy likely relies on some pattern or bias towards certain actions across states to navigate around obstacles and reach the goal efficiently. 

Maybe I can start by adjusting the parameter corresponding to action 0 (move down) more often than other actions, as it's a common direction toward the bottom right corner. For instance, if params[0] is set higher, the agent might take this action more frequently.

Alternatively, since moving left and up from certain states could be safer to avoid stepping into holes, perhaps increasing these parameters would help in exploring the state space where obstacles are present. However, I need to ensure that this doesn't lead the agent into the hole trap.

I should also consider how the reward function affects the policy. The episodic reward means each step adds a fixed value (0 or 1), encouraging exploration but rewarding reaching the goal. This can make it challenging for the agent to get stuck in local optima, as all actions might seem valid until the final step where stepping into a hole ends the episode.

Another idea is to analyze the provided top performing parameters and their rewards. For example, some params have higher f(params) values at certain iterations. By looking at these, I can see patterns that indicate which parameter configurations are better. 

I also recall that in such problems, sometimes policies favoring specific actions across multiple states can be effective. Maybe action 3 (right, up, down) is beneficial when the agent is exploring near walls or avoiding immediate goals.

To systematically approach this, I might need to implement a more efficient search method than trial and error, like using algorithms inspired by Q-Learning or policy gradient methods. However, since I'm only allowed to try different parameter values and observe the reward each time, I have to be strategic about which parameters to change and in what order.

Perhaps starting with higher values for action 0 (move down) would increase its usage more often. This could help in moving towards the goal area and reducing the chance of falling into holes. On the other hand, if the policy is too aggressive on certain actions, it might cause the agent to get stuck or take unnecessary risks.

I should also consider the impact of params[1], which is for action 1 (right). This could encourage taking rightward steps, possibly avoiding some paths that lead into holes. Similarly, action 3 (up) might be useful in exploring upward directions when blocked.

In summary, I think the optimal policy likely prioritizes moving down and left more often while also considering avoiding holes by adjusting other actions accordingly. However, without a clear pattern from the given examples, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact parameters. It would be best to experiment with increasing certain parameters systematically across states and track the reward outcomes to find which configuration yields the highest rewards at each iteration.
