You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help someone find the optimal policy for a FrozenLake environment using an episodic reward function. The policy is represented by an array of parameters, each choosing between four actions (0-3). The goal is to reach state 15, which is the bottom right corner, and the agent should avoid stepping into any holes that can trap it.

First, I need to understand how the policy works. Each parameter in the array corresponds to a state, where each state is numbered from 0 to 15. The policy at state i chooses one of the four actions based on the value stored in params[i]. 

I know that the goal is to maximize the episodic reward, which means I should consider the immediate reward (which is 0 except for state 15) and future rewards. Since the environment is slippery, each action has an equal probability of 0.25 when selected, but sometimes it's conditioned on certain actions. For example, action 0 can go left, down, or up with equal chance.

The key here is to find a combination of parameters that maximizes the expected cumulative reward over time without falling into any holes. The policy needs to explore until it finds a way around all possible holes and reaches state 15 efficiently.

Looking at the examples provided, some policies choose action 0 (left) when on top left, while others might take different paths. It seems that the optimal strategy requires careful balancing of exploring new paths versus exploiting known good ones. For instance, sometimes taking a more risky action can open up safer routes ahead.

I also notice that in some cases, the agent prefers certain actions based on their immediate benefits and future potential. For example, avoiding holes might require choosing different actions than those with higher rewards elsewhere. The slippery environment complicates this because each choice affects multiple states equally, so the policy must account for possible state transitions.

To find the optimal parameters, I would need to use a search algorithm like Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) or other reinforcement learning methods. However, since the exact values are needed and I'm just looking up based on past examples, I can infer that the optimal parameters tend towards avoiding immediate penalties but exploring alternatives where necessary.

I recall that in similar problems, the policy might prefer certain actions based on balance between exploration and exploitation. For example, sometimes choosing action 1 (right) might be better than others to avoid traps, leading to a combination like params[0] = 2, params[1] = 3, etc., as seen in some examples.

After considering the structure of the grid and the penalties involved, I think a balanced approach where the agent sometimes takes harder steps (like action 2) when it's safer might yield better results. This would likely involve parameters that encourage exploration but also leverage immediate rewards where possible.
