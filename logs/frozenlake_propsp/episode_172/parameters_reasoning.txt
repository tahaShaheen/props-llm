You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, let's try to figure out how to propose the next set of parameters for the FrozenLake environment. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward by reaching state 15 without falling into any holes. 

First, I need to understand the current situation. From the provided data, it looks like all the previous policies have been yielding low rewards around 0.05 to 0.15. Since these are far below the target of 1.0, I should adopt an explorative strategy rather than exploitative. My aim is to gather more information about which states and actions lead towards the goal or avoid holes.

Looking at the most recent policies, many have a pattern where certain states (like 0,1; 4,5 etc.) are taking action 3. For example, in params[0]:2; params[1]:3;..., the agent moves right from state 0 but then has issues. Maybe I should vary these actions to see different trajectories.

I also notice that states near the bottom-right (like 14 and 15) are crucial. If the policy directs towards moving up or left, it might prevent falling into holes. Alternatively, pushing towards the right or down could help reach the goal.

Considering state 0 is top-left (0,0), action 2 would move it to the right or other directions due to slipperiness. Maybe setting params[0] to 3 could try moving right with some probability. Similarly, for state 1 (0,1), perhaps action 0 instead of 3 could help avoid certain paths.

I should also check states near the holes and ensure that their actions don't lead directly into them. For example, if a hole is at (2,3) which is state 15, but wait no—state 15 is the goal, so maybe I confused something earlier. Holes are other specific states; perhaps states like 4,5, etc., are holes? Wait, in the original problem statement, it says to explore via trajectories, so some states are holes, and others are safe.

Wait, looking back, when the agent steps into a hole, the game ends. So the policy should avoid actions that can lead to those holes. For instance, if state 14 is just above the goal (15), taking action down might lead directly to 15, which is good. But I need to confirm which states are considered holes.

Assuming some states like 5,6,7 are holes? Or perhaps others—this needs careful consideration. Alternatively, maybe it's better to avoid certain actions in certain states that have historically led to low rewards or falling into traps.

Given the previous policies' trajectories, many end up stuck or fall into loops without reaching the goal. So I need a policy that can navigate more effectively towards 15 while avoiding holes.

Perhaps making state 0 take action 2 (right) to move towards state 3, which might then proceed down. Similarly, in state 1, taking action 1 could help explore different paths.

I should also look for states where the previous policies have failed and adjust their actions accordingly. For example, if from state 4, certain actions led to falling into a hole, I'd want that state's policy to choose an action that avoids it.

In summary, since the rewards are low, I'll explore by changing several parameters across different states to gather more data on which paths lead closer to the goal and which avoid holes. Maybe setting some states to move towards the right or down more often could help reach the goal faster.
