You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out how to approach this problem. So, the environment is a 4x4 grid called FrozenLake, and the goal is to reach state 15 (bottom-right corner) while avoiding holes that cause the episode to end. The agent can move in four directions, but because of the slippery nature, each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 integers, where each value corresponds to the action taken in a specific state (0-15). My task is to find the optimal set of actions that maximizes the episodic reward, which should ideally be around 1.0 when the agent reaches the goal.

Looking at the examples provided, I see several previous policies and their corresponding rewards. The top-performing ones have rewards ranging from 0.30 to 0.45, which are below the desired 1.0. This suggests that none of them are consistently reaching the goal state without falling into holes.

Since we're at iteration 888 out of 5000, it's still early in the process. The instructions mention that if the rewards are far from 1.0, I should act as an "Explorer" by choosing new configurations to gather more information rather than tweaking existing ones.

I need to propose a new set of params that hasn't been tried before and is distinct from previous attempts. One strategy might be to focus on creating paths that lead towards the goal while avoiding known holes. For example, states near the bottom-right (like 12, 13, 14) should ideally move right or down to reach state 15.

I'll consider making sure that states in the lower rows prioritize moving towards the right or down, as these directions are more likely to lead towards the goal. Additionally, I need to ensure that actions from other states don't inadvertently lead into holes based on previous trajectories.

Looking at the trajectory examples, some paths loop indefinitely without reaching the goal, indicating that certain policies might be getting stuck in cycles. To avoid this, perhaps adjusting actions in states where agents have previously gotten stuck could help them move towards the goal instead.

I'll also pay attention to states near the edges and corners, as moving outside the grid isn't allowed, so those should adjust their action probabilities accordingly to stay within bounds.

After considering these factors, I think a good approach is to set actions for each state that encourages movement towards state 15 without getting stuck. For instance, in state 0 (top-left), choosing an action that can move right or down might be beneficial.

I'll draft a new set of params where states closer to the goal have higher chances of moving towards it, and other states take actions that generally progress them towards the bottom-right while avoiding potential holes.
