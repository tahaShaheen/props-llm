You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I need to figure out the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) with the highest possible reward of +1, while avoiding holes that end the episode.

The environment is slippery, meaning each action leads to one of three directions randomly. So, even if I choose an action, there's a chance it might not go as intended. This adds uncertainty, so the policy needs to account for all possible outcomes.

Looking at the previous parameters and their rewards, most are around 0.15 or lower, which is much below the target of 1.0. That means I'm in "Explorer" mode, where I should try new configurations to gather more information rather than tweaking existing ones.

I need a policy that maximizes the chances of reaching state 15 while avoiding holes. Let's analyze each state:

- State 0 (top-left corner): Needs an action that can move towards the right or down, but considering slipperiness.
- States in row 0 (states 0-3) should probably push the agent to the right since the goal is on the far right.

I'll try setting most states in row 0 and near the goal to take actions that encourage moving right or down. For example:
- State 0: Action 1 (right, down, left) – might help move towards state 4 or stay in place.
- States 1,2,3: Similar approach, pushing towards the right.

For other states, maybe encourage movement towards the goal but ensure they don't lead into holes. For example:
- State 4: Action 2 (up, right, down) – could help move up to state 0 or right to state 5.
- State 8 (middle-left): Action 3 (left, up, right) – might move towards the goal.

I'll need to set each params[i] with actions that have a higher chance of leading closer to the goal without falling into holes. Since all params are based on states, I'll adjust each one to choose the best action considering their position and possible movements.

After thinking through, here's a tentative policy:
- For top row (0-3), set actions that push right or down.
- For middle rows, set actions that help move towards the goal without hitting holes.
- Ensure states near the goal (like 14) take action to reach 15.

I'll propose this configuration to test it and see if it improves the reward.
