You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help the agent reach the goal in the FrozenLake environment by choosing the right policy parameters. The current setup uses an array of 1s for all actions, but that doesn't seem effective because it's too rigid. My task is to explore different parameters and find which one gives the best reward.

First, I need to understand how the agent interacts with the environment. When the agent takes an action, it moves in a way that's influenced by some probability distribution. If the agent is on a specific state (like 0), it picks actions based on certain probabilities: down, left, and up each have a 1/3 chance if I remember correctly.

The goal is to reach state 15, which is the bottom right corner. All other states just give a reward of 0, except for state 0, which gives +1. So, the agent needs to efficiently navigate from the top-left to this goal without falling into any holes on the map.

Now, looking at the policy parameters array (params[0] to params[15]), each represents an action when in the corresponding grid cell. The current setup is all 1s, meaning no exploration beyond that. But since the reward structure is slippery and the states can fall into holes, a more thorough exploration of possible actions will likely yield better rewards.

The recent examples show some varying parameters with different behaviors. For instance, params[0] being 2 means when on state 0, it picks action 2, which is up. This could lead to exploring other areas before settling in a direction that might have caused the agent to step into a hole. Similarly, having params[1] as 3 means whenever in top-right (state4), the agent explores left or down with higher probability than right.

I think I should try different combinations where each parameter is set to 0, 1, 2, or 3. The key here is that any action can be taken when in a state, but avoiding cycles and making sure the agent doesn't get stuck. It's also important not to reuse parameters from previous attempts since they might have been too effective before.

Maybe I should focus on different corners or edges where the robot could fall into holes if it doesn't explore thoroughly. For example, testing params[0] = 2 (up) when in state0 and seeing how that affects movement. Or testing a combination like params[0]=1 and params[3]=1, which might allow for more exploration around the top row.

I should also remember not to repeat parameters from earlier attempts, as that could lead to local optima instead of global ones. Each parameter set should be unique and provide different exploration opportunities.

Given that the best reward so far is 0.25 or less in some examples, I might want to try a balance where each parameter has a chance to explore its action without being overly deterministic. Perhaps starting with parameters like [1:3, 2:1, 2:2, ...] could offer varied movement patterns that avoid repeating the same paths too much.

In summary, my strategy will be to systematically vary each parameter from 0 to 3, ensuring each is unique in every attempt, and evaluate which combination leads to the highest reward. I'll start by trying parameters around the ones that have holes on the top and right sides, allowing the agent more room to explore before making decisions based solely on local rewards.
