You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the environment is a 4x4 grid where each state is represented by numbers from 0 to 15. The agent can move in four directions—up, down, left, right—but because it's slippery, each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability. The goal is state 15, which gives a +1 reward, and all other states give 0. There are also holes that end the episode if stepped on.

The policy is an array of 16 numbers, where each element represents the action taken in that state. The values can be 0, 1, 2, or 3, corresponding to four possible actions. The challenge is to find the set of parameters (params) that maximize the episodic reward on average.

Looking at the provided information, the top-performing policies have an average reward around 0.45, which is significantly below the target of 1.0. This suggests that we're not yet reaching the goal consistently, so there's room for improvement.

In the recent attempts, several parameters were tried, but they either led to falling into holes or didn't reach the goal efficiently. For example, one policy with params[0]:3 resulted in a reward of 0.00, which is worse than the current top performers. Another attempt had all actions set to 3, leading to an average of 0.00 as well.

Since the rewards are still low, according to the strategy, I should act as an Explorer and try configurations that haven't been seen before to gather new information. The goal is to maximize information gain by exploring different policies rather than exploiting the current best ones since they aren't performing optimally yet.

I notice that in some of the top policies, certain states have specific actions. For example, state 0 often uses action 1 or 2, which might help navigate towards the right or up/down depending on the grid layout. However, without knowing the exact positions of the holes, it's tricky to decide the best path.

I think a good approach is to design a policy that moves towards the goal while avoiding risky states. Since the agent can move in multiple directions probabilistically, maybe setting actions that generally push the agent towards the bottom-right corner (state 15) would help. For example, in state 0 (top-left), moving right or down might be beneficial.

Let me consider each state and decide an action:

- State 0: Top-left. To move right or down.
- States near the top row should push towards the bottom.
- Middle states should navigate towards the right or down depending on their position.
- The last row should encourage moving to the right, except for state 15.

But since each action leads to three possible moves with equal chance, I need to pick actions that give a higher probability of reaching the goal without falling into holes. Maybe setting all states to move towards the right or down as much as possible.

Looking at the recent attempts, some params had action 3 (which includes moving up, right, down) for state 0 and others used action 1 or 2. To try something new, perhaps set state 0 to action 2, which allows moving up, right, or down—giving a chance to move towards the goal.

I'll propose a policy where most states are set to actions that push towards the bottom-right, avoiding the previous params as much as possible to ensure we're exploring new configurations.
