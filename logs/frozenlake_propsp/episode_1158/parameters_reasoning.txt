You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to set the parameters for this FrozenLake environment to get the best policy. The goal is to reach state 15 with the highest possible reward, which should be around 1.0 if we're doing well.

Looking at the problem, it's a 4x4 grid where each cell can be thought of as states from 0 to 15. The agent can move in four directions, but because the environment is slippery, each action leads to three possible next states with equal probability. That makes things tricky because even if the agent chooses an optimal direction, it might not end up there due to the slipperiness.

The key here is to avoid the holes and maximize the chances of reaching state 15. The policy needs to be set such that each state (params[i]) has a specific action that will help navigate towards the goal while avoiding dangerous states.

From the examples provided, I can see that some policies have varying degrees of success. The best so far is around 0.45 average reward over 20 episodes, but we need to get closer to 1.0. That suggests there's room for improvement in the current policies.

I remember that in FrozenLake, a common strategy is to move right or down as much as possible since the goal is at the bottom-right corner. But considering the slipperiness, choosing actions that maximize the chances of moving towards the goal despite the randomness might be better.

Looking at the most recent parameters, they've tried various combinations but haven't reached the optimal yet. Maybe I should consider making more aggressive moves or ensuring that certain key states always move towards safe directions.

Also, since we're stateless and can't remember previous attempts, each suggestion needs to explore new configurations without repeating past ones. So, perhaps changing a few parameters in the current top-performing policies could lead us closer to the optimal reward.

I think I should focus on setting up key states like the starting position (state 0) to move right or down. Maybe state 0 should always try to go right since that's the direction towards the goal. Similarly, for other states along the path, they should push towards moving towards the goal while avoiding holes.

Wait, but in the provided examples, some policies are getting stuck or falling into loops. That suggests that the current parameters might be leading the agent into cycles instead of progressing towards the goal. To fix this, I need to ensure that each state's action choice breaks such cycles and encourages movement towards the goal.

I should also consider the slip probabilities. For example, if an action is chosen, it can lead to three possible directions. So, setting actions in states near the goal might prioritize moving right or down more, increasing the chances of reaching 15.

Maybe I'll adjust some parameters to make sure that when the agent is close to the goal, they have a higher chance of moving towards it despite the slipperiness. For instance, state 12 (which is just above the goal) should probably move right every time because from there, moving right would take them to state 15.

Another thought: perhaps some states near the holes need to be set to avoid those directions entirely. If a state can lead to a hole, the policy should choose an action that minimizes that risk. So, for example, if being in state x, choosing an action that doesn't have any of the possible next steps as a hole would be safer.

Given all this, I'll try adjusting certain parameters to encourage movement towards the goal and avoid risky moves. Maybe set more states along the bottom row to move right or down when possible. Let's construct a new parameter array with these considerations in mind.
