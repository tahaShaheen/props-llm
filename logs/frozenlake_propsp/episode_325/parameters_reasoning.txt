You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to find the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment where the agent has slippery actions and some holes that require exploration. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right) with the highest reward possible. 

First, I understand the environment: it's a 4x4 grid where each cell can be represented by a number from 0 to 15. The agent can move left, down, right, or up, but when moving in certain directions, there's a probability of going in all three directions. The agent starts at state 0 and needs to reach state 15.

I know that the policy is a function mapping each state (0-15) to an action (0-3). The values of params[0], [1], etc., determine which action is chosen when in those states. Each param value can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.

The key here is that the policy should avoid getting stuck on holes by exploring neighboring cells to uncover any holes first before trying an action. So, if an agent is near a hole, it shouldn't follow a known policy but instead explore possible paths to find holes and then adapt the policy accordingly.

Given the options for each param value (0-3), I need to choose values that result in a policy that can navigate the grid efficiently, especially around the slippery actions. The optimal reward is expected around 1.0, which is the maximum possible since reaching state 15 gives +1 reward and all others are 0.

I'll consider each action when in each state:

- Action 0: moves down, left, up (each with probability 1/3).
- Action 1: moves right, down, left.
- Action 2: moves up, right, down.
- Action 3: moves left, up, right.

I need a policy where for each state, the chosen action maximizes the expected reward. This might involve prioritizing actions that lead closer to the goal or exploring when stuck in loops.

One approach is to assign higher values to actions that lead towards the hole and lower towards those near the goal. Since slippery actions are present, I have to balance exploration (trying all directions) with exploitation (following known good actions).

Looking at some examples provided, the top performing policy assigns action 2 (up) more frequently in certain states, which could be because it avoids hard penalties or higher rewards.

I should try different combinations and see how they affect the expected reward. If a policy consistently reaches the goal, it's better than others that get stuck on holes.
