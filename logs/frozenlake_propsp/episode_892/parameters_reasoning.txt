You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help optimize a policy for the FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with the highest possible reward by choosing actions that maximize the chances of getting there without falling into any holes.

First, I need to understand the environment better. It's a 4x4 grid where each cell is a state from 0 to 15. Moving in any direction has a slippery effect, meaning the agent doesn't always end up where it intended—it can go one of three directions with equal probability depending on the action taken.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 numbers (params), each representing the action to take from that state. The actions are 0,1,2,3, each corresponding to different movement options with some probabilities.

Looking at the top 5 best-performing params provided, most of them have a reward around 0.35-0.45. This suggests that the current policies aren't reaching the goal very often, as the optimal should be around 1.0. So, there's room for improvement.

The recent params show some variation in their structures, but none are getting close to the goal consistently. For example, one trajectory ends quickly by falling into a hole or not making progress towards state 15.

Since we're at iteration 892 and need to reach 5000, I'm in the early stages of optimization. The advice is to maximize information gain and explore if rewards are far from optimal. Since current rewards are below 0.45, which is significantly less than 1.0, we should be in "explorer" mode—trying out new configurations to gather more data.

Looking at the recent params, they have some commonalities, like often choosing action 3 for state 1 (params[1]: 3) and other states having similar patterns. To explore, I need to propose a param set that's different from what's been tried before.

I should ensure each state is mapped to an action that doesn't lead into holes as much as possible. For example, in the starting state (0), choosing actions that generally move towards state 15 without getting stuck.

Let me think about each state and which action would be best. Maybe for state 0, trying a different direction than previous policies. If previously it was action 1 or 2, maybe try action 3 to see if that leads somewhere new.

Similarly, for other states like 4 (which is the second cell in the first row), perhaps changing the action could help avoid holes or find a better path.

I need to make sure I don't repeat any previous params. So each proposed set should be entirely new across all 16 states.

Perhaps focusing on creating paths that move towards state 15, avoiding edges where holes are likely. For example, in state 0 (top-left), moving right or down might help. But since actions have probabilities, the policy needs to choose actions that statistically increase chances of reaching the goal.

I should also consider that each action from a state leads to three possible next states with equal probability. So for each state, I need an action that maximizes the expected reward based on those possible transitions, avoiding holes as much as possible.

Given all this, let me construct a new params array where each state is assigned an action that hasn't been tried before and that logically moves towards the goal or avoids dangerous areas.
