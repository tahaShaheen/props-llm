You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to help find the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment using the given parameters. The goal is to reach state 15 (the right bottom grid) and get a reward of +1, while avoiding holes that end the game by stepping on them. 

First, I need to understand how the agent interacts with the environment. The agent can move in four directions: left, down, right, up. Each movement is chosen based on the policy parameters provided as an array of 16 elements, where each element represents a state (0-15) and the corresponding action index.

The policies are represented by [params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, ..., params[15]: W]. The values for params can be 0, 1, 2, or 3. Each action is chosen based on these parameters: if the parameter value is 0, it's between move down, left, and up; 1 is between right, down, and left; 2 is between up, right, and down; and 3 is between left, up, and right.

I need to ensure that I don't repeat any parameters from the top 9 performing ones. The best-performing params have lower f(params) values (like around 0.1 or 0.2), which means better exploration might be needed. 

Also, when exploring, the agent should not follow previously seen policies but explore trajectories to find better paths. If a hole is stepped on, the game ends, so the agent must avoid these areas.

I'll start by considering possible actions for each state based on the parameters and ensure that the same parameter isn't repeated in the output. I need to test different combinations to see which ones perform better, but since I can only provide one set of params, I'll aim to choose a set that balances exploration and exploitation without repeating previous options.

I should also consider any holes mentioned in the problem statement. It doesn't specify where they are yet, so perhaps I can assume that certain states are safe or not, but for now, I might just focus on the parameters given.

Given the time constraints, I'll choose a parameter set that gives a decent reward without being too greedy to avoid getting stuck. For example, params like [1, 2, 0, 3] could be a starting point as they balance exploration and exploitation.
