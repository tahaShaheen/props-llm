You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to propose the next set of parameters for the FrozenLake environment. The goal is to find a global optimal policy that maximizes the episodic reward, which should ideally be around 1.0.

First, let's understand the problem. The agent moves on a 4x4 grid with states numbered from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). The environment is slippery, meaning each action leads to one of three possible directions with equal probability. Holes are present, and stepping on them ends the episode. The reward is +1 for reaching state 15.

The policy is a function that maps each state (0-15) to an action (0-3). My task is to propose a new set of params without repeating any previous ones and ensure it doesn't fall into holes, while maximizing the chance to reach the goal.

Looking at the provided data:
- The top 6 best-performing policies have rewards around 0.20 to 0.30.
- Recent proposals didn't yield much reward (often 0.00), suggesting they either fell into holes or got stuck in loops without reaching the goal.

Since the current highest reward is below 1.0, I need to explore more rather than exploit. The idea is to propose a new policy that hasn't been tried yet and could potentially reach state 15 more efficiently.

I notice that some states might have policies leading towards holes. For example, if a state near a hole has an action that often leads into it, the agent would fail frequently. So, I need to adjust those states' actions to avoid such outcomes.

Let me consider each state and think about which actions are safe and effective:

- State 0 (top-left): Possible moves are down, left, or up, but left is out of bounds. So, choosing actions that move towards the goal without falling into holes.
- Similarly, other states should be evaluated based on their position relative to the goal and nearby holes.

I'll start by creating a new params array where each state's action is chosen to either move directly towards the goal or avoid moving into potential holes. Since the environment is slippery, I need to consider all possible directions an action could lead and ensure none of them result in falling into a hole.

For example:
- For states near the top-left corner (0), actions should encourage moving right or down.
- For states along the edges, actions should be chosen to move towards the center or goal without risking falls.

I'll try setting each state's action to one that increases the likelihood of moving towards state 15 while avoiding dangerous moves. Let me assign these actions step by step.

After evaluating each state and considering possible safe paths, I'll propose a new set of params. This should be distinct from all previous ones and designed to explore new trajectories that might lead to higher rewards.
