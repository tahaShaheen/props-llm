You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy parameters for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with as high a reward as possible, avoiding the holes. From what's given, the current policies aren't performing well—rewards are around 0.15 or lower.

First, I need to understand how the slippery actions work. Each action taken by the agent results in three possible moves with equal probability. So, for example, choosing action 0 (left) might actually move down, left, or up each with a 1/3 chance.

Looking at the previous top policies, most have params alternating between certain actions. For instance, many have a pattern where they switch between 1 and 3 for consecutive states. This might be an attempt to navigate towards the goal but isn't effective due to the slipperiness causing more confusion.

Since the agent can't remember past attempts (stateless), each suggestion needs to explore new possibilities without prior knowledge. The current strategies seem stuck in lower reward zones, so perhaps I need to introduce more varied actions that could lead the agent to discover new paths towards state 15.

I notice that some policies try moving down and right, which are good directions toward the goal (state 15 is bottom-right). Maybe adjusting certain states to push more towards these directions would help. For example, in state 0 (top-left), choosing action 2 might move up or right, but since it's slippery, there's a chance to go right even if that's not the intended action.

Another approach could be ensuring that once the agent is near the goal, like states 13 or 14, they have a higher chance of moving towards state 15. Maybe setting their actions to move right or down would increase the chances of reaching the goal.

I should also consider avoiding the holes by making sure that when the agent is in a position where certain actions could lead into a hole, it chooses alternative moves. For example, if from state 3 (top-right), moving right leads into a hole, so perhaps choosing an action that has a higher probability of moving down instead would help avoid that.

I think a more aggressive move towards the goal might be needed. Maybe setting certain states to always try moving right or down, even if there's a chance they might not make it due to slipping, but increasing overall chances.

Looking at previous policies, maybe I can change some key states' actions. For instance, in state 8 (third row, first column), choosing action 3 might give a better chance of moving towards the goal rather than other directions.

I also need to ensure that the policy doesn't get stuck in loops or go into holes by making sure each state's action has a balanced probability of moving towards the goal without leading into traps.

After considering all this, I'll propose a new set of parameters where certain key states (like those near the top and left) have actions that push more towards right and down. This should maximize the chances of reaching the goal by utilizing the slippery nature to drift in the desired direction.
