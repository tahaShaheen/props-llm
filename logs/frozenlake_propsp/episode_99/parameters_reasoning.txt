You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy parameters for this FrozenLake environment using a policy gradient method. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right corner) and maximize the reward of +1 for that state. All other states give 0, but holes can end the game by stepping on them.

The policy is represented by an array where each index corresponds to a state (0 to 15), and the value at each index is the action to take from that state. The actions are 0-3, corresponding to left, down, right, up moves. 

I remember that in policy gradient methods like PPO or A2C, the objective is often to maximize the expected return by adjusting these parameters. The recent best performing params had some interesting patterns: actions alternate between taking different directions based on their state.

Looking at the top 9 performing params:

- params[0] = 2, action 2 (up)
- params[1] = 3, action 3 (up or right)
- params[2] = 1, action 1 (right)
- And so on...

These seem to alternate between taking different actions based on their states. For example, in the top line, params[0]=2 means up, params[1]=3 could mean up or right, and params[2]=1 is right.

I think the optimal policy likely involves alternating between exploring different directions as you reach new areas of the map. This way, you're not getting stuck on a hole and can explore the entire grid more thoroughly.

However, I also notice that some actions are being repeated for certain states. For instance, in params[0]=2, params[1]=3 (which is up or right), and params[2]=1 (right). This suggests that when you're in a state with action 2 (up), sometimes taking action 3 might also be an option, which could indicate some exploration.

To find the global optimal, I should consider moving through all possible actions whenever possible. Maybe starting from lower indices to higher ones and varying the parameters accordingly. But since it's a grid, each state is connected, so perhaps some form of gradient ascent can help.

Another approach is to mix action 3 (up or right) with other options for states that benefit from moving upwards more. This could balance exploration and exploitation without getting stuck on holes.

Wait, the agent should explore through holes by reading history trajectories. So maybe using a replay buffer or exploring different paths based on recent interactions can help avoid local optima. But since this is about policy optimization, perhaps focusing on maximizing each state's reward with appropriate actions is more straightforward.

I think I need to test various combinations where certain states take action 3 (up or right), and others take up or down as needed. But without specific data, it's hard to say exactly which parameters will give the best results. Maybe some higher values for action 3 in certain areas and lower for others could balance exploration.

Overall, I'm leaning towards increasing the probabilities of taking actions that allow exploring different directions across the grid, especially when near holes or edges. This way, the agent can explore more effectively and reach the goal without getting stuck.
