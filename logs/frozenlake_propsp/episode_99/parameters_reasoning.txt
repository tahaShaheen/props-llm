You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) and get a reward of +1, while avoiding holes which end the episode with 0 reward.

First, I need to understand the problem better. The grid is 4x4, so states are numbered from 0 to 15. Each state has an action that's selected by the policy params[i], where i is the state number. The agent can move in four directions, but because it's slippery, each action taken leads to three possible moves with equal probability.

Holes are present, and if the agent steps on one, the episode ends immediately. So, the policy needs to avoid actions that could lead to these holes. The challenge is to find a policy that maximizes the chance of reaching state 15 without falling into any holes.

Looking at the provided data, most policies have very low rewards (around 0.10), which suggests that it's difficult for the current policies to reach the goal consistently. The best reward so far is 0.10, which is much lower than the target of around 1.0. This indicates that the agent isn't effectively navigating towards the goal and might be falling into holes or getting stuck in loops.

In the top-performing params, I notice that several states are set to action 3, which corresponds to moving left, up, or right with equal chance. However, since the environment is slippery, this might not be leading the agent directly towards the goal.

I should consider what actions would lead each state closer to state 15. For example, in state 0 (top-left corner), taking action 3 (which includes moving right, down, or left) might help, but since it's slippery, there's a chance of moving in other directions. Maybe setting state 0 to action 2 could push it towards the right more.

But without knowing where the holes are exactly, I have to infer based on previous trajectories. For instance, if an agent takes a certain path and ends up falling into a hole, that suggests that some states leading to that path should avoid specific actions.

Looking at the recent policies, most of them result in very low rewards, so perhaps they're getting stuck or falling into holes frequently. To improve, I need to propose a policy that either explores new territories (as an explorer) since the current reward is far below 1.0, or tweak the best ones slightly as an optimizer.

Since the rewards are still low, I'll focus on exploration. I should choose a policy that hasn't been tried before and might provide new information about the environment.

One approach could be to set all states near the goal (like state 12, 13, 14) to move right or down, depending on their position, to ensure they reach the goal. For example, in state 14, which is just above the goal, moving down should take it to 15.

But considering the slippery nature, maybe setting states around the edges to move towards the goal direction more directly would help.

I'll try creating a new policy where each state's action is set to move towards the right or down as much as possible. For instance:

- States in the top row (0-3) should prefer moving down.
- States in the first column (0,4,8,12) should prefer moving right.

But I have to ensure that this doesn't lead into any holes. Since I don't know where the holes are, I'll assume certain states might be dangerous and adjust accordingly.

Another idea is to set a deterministic policy for some states. For example:

- State 0 (top-left): action 3 (right, up, left) — but since it's on the edge, maybe action 2 (up, right, down) would push it more towards the right.
Wait, in state 0, possible moves are right to 1, down to 4, or up which is invalid. But considering the slippery nature, action 3 for state 0 could lead to moving right, down, or left. However, since the agent can't move up from state 0 (it's already at the top), maybe action 3 isn't ideal because it allows moving left, which could loop.

Alternatively, setting state 0 to action 2 would allow moves right, down, or up. But up is invalid, so effectively, it's moving right or down with a third option being invalid, but in practice, the agent might just choose between right and down more often.

I think I need to test different configurations for each state, trying to push towards the goal while avoiding areas that previous policies have failed in.

After considering these factors, I'll propose a new set of params where states are directed towards the goal as much as possible without repeating previous attempts. For example:

params[0] = 2 (action 2), which includes moving up, right, or down.
But since state 0 is top-left, moving up is invalid, so effectively, it's moving right or down.

I'll set each state to the action that best pushes towards state 15, considering their position and possible moves. This might involve setting states in the last column (states 3,7,11,15) to move down, as they can't go further right.

Wait, but state 15 is the goal. So for other states near it, like state 14, moving down would reach 15.

I'll structure the params such that each state's action directs towards the right or down based on its position, while avoiding actions that might lead into holes as inferred from previous trajectories.

After careful consideration, I'll create a new policy where most states are set to move right or down, ensuring progression towards the goal without repeating past attempts.
