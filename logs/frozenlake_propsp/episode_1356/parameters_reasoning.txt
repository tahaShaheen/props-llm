You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I need to come up with a global optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment based on the given setup. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) while avoiding holes. The agent's actions are slippery, meaning each action has a 33% chance of moving in one of three directions.

First, I should understand the layout and the possible moves. The grid is 4x4, with states numbered from 0 to 15. Holes are present, but their exact positions aren't specified here. However, from previous trajectories, it seems that certain paths lead to holes or the goal.

Looking at the top-performing params provided, most have f(params) around 0.35-0.45, which is lower than the target of 1.0. This suggests that current policies aren't consistently reaching the goal without falling into holes. To improve, I need to adjust the policy to either find a path with higher success rates or avoid dangerous states more effectively.

I notice that in the recent params, some are getting rewards as low as 0.00. That likely means those policies are frequently stepping on holes. Therefore, I should focus on creating a policy that either navigates around known problematic areas or moves directly towards the goal with higher precision.

Considering the slipperiness, each action has three possible outcomes. So, to reach the goal reliably, the policy must choose actions that maximize the chance of moving in the desired direction while considering the probabilities.

Looking at state 0 (top-left corner), it's best to move right or down since those are the two main directions towards the goal. Similarly, for other states, I should map out the optimal next steps that lead towards state 15 without crossing into holes.

Since I can't remember previous attempts, each suggestion must be a new configuration, different from what's been tried before. So, I need to explore new action mappings across all states.

I'll start by considering state 0: moving right (action 1) or down (action 3). Action 1 for state 0 could help the agent move towards the goal in one of three directions—right, down, or left—but since it's the top-left corner, moving right is essential. Similarly, for other states, I'll map out actions that push the agent closer to the goal.

I should also ensure that each action choice doesn't lead into a hole based on previous trajectories. For example, if state 4 (first row, second column) tends to fall into holes when taking certain actions, I'll choose an action that avoids those paths.

After analyzing, I'll propose a new set of params where each state's action is selected to maximize the chance of moving towards the goal without stepping on holes. This might involve choosing specific directions for each state based on their position relative to the goal and avoiding known risky moves.
