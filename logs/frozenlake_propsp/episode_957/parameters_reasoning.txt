You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment to maximize the reward. The goal is to reach state 15, which gives a +1 reward, while avoiding holes that end the episode immediately.

First, I need to understand the environment better. It's a 4x4 grid, with states numbered from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). The slippery nature means each action has a 33% chance of moving in three directions instead of one. So when an agent takes an action, it doesn't go exactly where it wants; there's some uncertainty.

Looking at the provided top 6 best-performing policies, their average reward is around 0.45. The global optimal should be around 1.0, so we have room for improvement. All these policies seem to get stuck or fall into holes because they aren't reaching state 15 consistently.

The recent trajectories show that the agent isn't effectively navigating towards the goal. For example, in one trajectory, the agent stays in state 0 multiple times and ends up moving down when it shouldn't. This suggests that the current policies might not be encouraging movement towards state 15 or are leading into dead-ends.

I should consider how to make the policy guide the agent more directly toward state 15 while avoiding holes. Maybe the agent needs to prioritize right and down movements since the goal is at (3,3). However, because of the slippery nature, each action has a probability spread.

Looking at the current policies, they seem to mix different actions. To improve, perhaps some states should be set to always move towards the goal. For instance, in state 0, moving right (action 1) could help progress towards the goal without immediately falling into holes.

But I also need to ensure that from each state, the chosen action doesn't lead into a hole with high probability. Maybe I should review which states are holes and adjust accordingly. Without knowing exactly where the holes are, I can assume they're in certain positions, so the policy must avoid them by choosing safe actions.

To maximize information gain, since I'm supposed to act as an explorer now (since rewards are below 1.0), I need to propose a new parameter configuration that's different from previous ones but has potential for higher reward.

Looking at the recent params, most have certain patterns. For example, many have action 3 or 1 in state 0. Maybe changing some of these to action 2 (up) or 0 (down) could alter the trajectory significantly.

Wait, no—action 2 from state 0 is up, which might not help because the agent is already at the top row. So perhaps action 1 (right) is better for state 0.

But considering the slippery nature, moving right might sometimes lead down or left as well. Maybe a more aggressive policy towards the goal is needed.

I'll try to set some key states to specific actions. For example:

- State 0: Action 1 (right)
- State 3: Action 2 (down) or action 1 (right), depending on position
- States near the bottom-right should push towards state 15.

But without knowing hole positions, it's tricky. Maybe a more cautious approach is better, where each state has actions that avoid likely holes.

Alternatively, perhaps using a policy gradient method or Q-learning would help, but since I'm supposed to propose parameters, I'll have to think of a specific set.

Looking at the previous params, they seem to cycle through actions in certain states. Maybe introducing more determinism could help. For example, setting certain states to always move right or down when possible.

I think the best approach now is to suggest a new parameter configuration that shifts some states towards right and down actions, especially those closer to the goal, while ensuring that from other states, the agent moves in directions that avoid holes based on previous trajectories.

So, I'll propose a params array where:

- States near the top-right are set to move down or right.
- Middle states might have a mix of actions to explore but bias towards moving towards the goal.
- Earlier states (like 0) push towards right.

This should create paths that more directly lead towards state 15 while reducing chances of falling into holes based on previous trajectories where agents got stuck in loops or went off track.
