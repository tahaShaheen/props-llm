You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward by reaching state 15 without falling into any holes. From the problem statement, I know that each action taken by the agent has a slippery effect, meaning it doesn't go exactly where it aims but instead moves in three possible directions with equal probability.

First, I need to understand the environment better. It's a 4x4 grid, so states are numbered from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). The agent can move left, down, right, or up, but each action leads to one of three possible moves with equal chance. This makes it probabilistic and adds uncertainty to the state transitions.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 elements, where each element corresponds to the action taken in that state. The challenge here is to determine which actions will lead the agent towards the goal (state 15) while avoiding the holes.

Looking at the provided data, the top-performing policies have f(params) around 0.45, which is significantly below the target of 1.0. This suggests that there's room for improvement in the current strategies. The trajectories show that many attempts end up stuck or falling into loops without reaching the goal.

To maximize information gain and follow the stateless strategy, I should propose a new policy that explores different paths rather than tweaking existing ones since the rewards are still low. I need to ensure that each parameter is unique from previous attempts to gather new data on which states lead closer to the goal or into holes.

I'll consider setting actions for each state that generally move towards the right and down, as these directions would guide the agent toward the bottom-right corner (state 15). However, since the environment is slippery, I should choose actions that increase the probability of moving in the desired direction. For example, from state 0, taking action 0 might lead to moving down, left, or up, but perhaps another action could be more favorable.

Looking at each state:

- State 0 (top-left): To move right towards higher-numbered states, I might choose action 1, which allows movement right, down, or left. But since it's better to go towards the goal, maybe action 1 is suitable as it has a chance to move right.
- Similarly, for other starting states, choosing actions that have a higher probability of moving towards the goal.

But considering the slippery nature, perhaps setting all policies to always try to move right or down would be beneficial. However, in some cases, like near the edges, different actions might be safer.

Given that the current top policies are not performing well, I'll propose a policy where each state's action is set to increase the likelihood of moving towards the goal. For example:

- Even-numbered states (left side) choose right-moving actions.
- Odd-numbered states (right side) choose down-moving actions.

But translating this into specific action values requires looking at how each action affects movement. Action 1 for state 0 might be better than others, as it includes moving right. So I'll set params[0] to 1.

Continuing this logic for other states, adjusting based on their position relative to the goal. The aim is to create a path that generally heads towards the bottom-right without getting stuck or falling into holes.

After considering all these factors and ensuring that each parameter is unique from previous attempts, I'll propose a new set of params.
