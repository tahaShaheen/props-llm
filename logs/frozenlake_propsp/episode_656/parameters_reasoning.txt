You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me start by understanding the setup.

The grid is 4x4 with states numbered from 0 to 15. The goal is state 15, which gives a reward of +1. All other states give 0 except if you fall into a hole, which ends the episode. The slippery nature means each action has three possible outcomes with equal probability.

From the problem statement, I know that the policy is an array of 16 actions (each from 0-3) mapping each state to an action. My goal is to find the optimal policy that maximizes the reward, ideally around 1.0 per episode.

Looking at the top 4 best performing params, their average rewards are around 0.25-0.35. That's not too high, so maybe we need better exploration or adjustments in certain states.

The recent 5 policies all have low rewards (0.00 to 0.05). This suggests that the current strategies aren't effective enough. Maybe I should try a different approach instead of tweaking the existing ones.

Since the goal is state 15, which is at the bottom right, I need actions that guide towards this area while avoiding holes. Let me think about each state's position and possible transitions.

For example, in state 0 (top-left corner), moving down leads to state 4, left isn't possible since it's the edge, up would take it out of bounds, so action 0 could be problematic because it has a chance to go left or up. Maybe choosing an action that tends towards right or down is better.

Wait, but the environment is slippery, so each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability. So for state i, when taking action a, there are three possible next states. I need to choose actions that have the highest chance of leading to non-hole and towards the goal states.

I also notice from the trajectories that some policies get stuck in loops or end up in holes. To avoid this, the policy must guide the agent away from dangerous areas and towards safe paths.

Perhaps focusing on creating a path that moves right when possible to reach state 15. Let's consider each row:

- Top row (states 0-3): Moving down or right might be better.
- Second row (4-7): Maybe moving right or down depending on position.
- Third row (8-11): Need to move towards the bottom-right.
- Bottom row (12-15): Only state 15 is good; others are holes except for state 12 which might lead towards it.

I should also check where the holes are. From the problem statement, I don't have explicit info on which states are holes, but I can infer from trajectories that certain states lead to termination. For example, in one of the recent params, state 0's action led to a loop (staying in 0 repeatedly), which is bad.

Maybe assigning specific actions to each state based on their position and the likelihood of avoiding holes. Let me think about key positions:

- State 15: Always choose an action that stays or moves towards itself, but since it's terminal, perhaps no action needed.
- States near the goal (like 12,13,14) should move right or down to reach 15.

But considering the slippery nature, actions from these states might still have a chance to go into holes. So I need to choose actions that maximize the probability of reaching 15 while minimizing the risk.

Let me try to create a policy where:

- In state 0 (top-left), action 2 or 3 which might move down or right.
- For each state, prefer actions that increase row and column towards 15.

Wait, but some actions have different movement sets. Let me clarify:

Action 0 leads to [down, left, up]
Action 1: [right, down, left]
Action 2: [up, right, down]
Action 3: [left, up, right]

So each action has a mix of directions.

For state 0 (top-left), possible moves are limited. Action 0 would try to go down or left but can't go up. So maybe action 1 is better because it includes right and down, which could help move towards the goal.

Similarly, for other edge states, certain actions might be more beneficial.

I think a greedy approach where each state chooses the action that has the highest probability of moving towards non-hole states would work best. But without knowing the exact hole positions, I have to infer based on the trajectories.

Looking at one trajectory: (0,1) (4,2) (8,2), which ended with reward 0.35. So state 0 action 1 led to state 4, then action 2 from there led to 8, and so on. That might be a decent path.

Another thought: maybe create a policy where each state tries to move right or down, depending on their position, using the actions that have higher chances of doing so. For example:

- States in top row: prefer right (action 1) as it can lead towards the goal.
- Middle states: action 2 might help go down and right.

But I'm not sure. Maybe a better approach is to assign for each state the action that has the highest chance of avoiding holes and moving closer to the goal.

Wait, considering that the optimal reward should be around 1.0, which implies that on average, the agent reaches the goal in one step per episode. But given the slippery nature, it's challenging.

Perhaps a policy that ensures movement towards the right as much as possible without getting stuck. Let me think of setting actions for each state to move either right or down, depending on their position.

Alternatively, considering that some states have better chances of reaching the goal via certain actions, I should set params[i] such that from i, there's a higher chance of moving towards 15 without hitting a hole.

Since the agent can't remember previous attempts, each iteration must propose a new policy based on maximizing information gain. Given that current rewards are low, maybe I need to try more varied policies to explore better paths.

I think I'll go with setting most states to action 2 or 3, which have right and down movements, as these seem to be the directions towards the goal.
