You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to find the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment with the slippery policy described. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand the environment setup. The state is a 4x4 grid (0 to 15), and each action (up, down, left, right) has different probabilities. When an agent takes an action, it moves in three directions with equal probability because of the slippery policy. This means that from any state, all four possible actions are equally likely.

The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner), which gives a reward of +1. All other states give a reward of 0. The tricky part is dealing with holes in the map, so once the agent steps on a hole, it can't move there anymore.

Now, looking at the policy parameters params, each element from 0 to 3 represents the action (up, down, left, right) when the state number corresponds to that index. For example, params[0] is the action for state 0, and so on until params[15].

The current best reward from the top 9 performing params gives an f(params) of around 0.28, which isn't great. But I need to find a policy with higher rewards.

I notice that some parameters in the recent examples have values beyond [0,3], but according to the problem statement, all params should be within [0,1,2,3]. So perhaps the current best is just above optimal, and we can tweak those specific parameters.

Looking at the top 9 performing param sets, I see several patterns. For example, when params[6] and others are set higher (like 2 or 3), it sometimes results in lower rewards. But there's also a set where all params are either 1 or 2 except for some specific states, which could lead to better exploration.

I think the optimal policy likely involves a balance between moving towards the goal and avoiding holes by sometimes taking actions that go back, especially from certain states where the agent might be near a hole. For example, when in state 0 (top-left), sometimes taking an up action might lead it into a hole, so it should avoid those cases.

Let me consider specific states where moving right could hit a hole:

- State 2 is next to a hole at 7. So from state 2, the agent shouldn't take the left action because that would go towards a hole.
- State 3 might lead into a hole if taken with another action.
  
By setting certain parameters high, like params[6] and others where moving right or down could be risky, I can prevent the agent from entering these holes. 

I should test parameters that set some actions higher to avoid getting stuck in unsafe paths. For instance:

- params[0]: 1 (move down)
- params[2]: 2 (move up)
- params[5]: 3 (move left)
- params[6]: 1 (move right)

This way, the agent doesn't take the immediate risk of moving into a hole, but still tries to reach the goal.

I should try this combination and see if it improves the reward from higher than 0.28.
