You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out the best policy parameters for the FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with the highest possible reward, which is +1, and avoid the holes where the state numbers are higher than 4. The current setup uses an array of parameters that each can be set to 0-3. 

First, I recall that in grid-based games like this, the policy often involves taking certain actions based on the state's position. For example, moving straight right from (2,1) is likely action 1, which includes right, down, and left. So, higher numbers might be used when there are obstacles nearby.

Looking at the provided top-performing parameters, I see several sets with different combinations. One set has a lot of 0s except for some 3s. For instance, params[6] is 1 (right), others around it seem to have 2 or 3. This might indicate that avoiding certain directions when next to obstacles is optimal.

I also notice that in the most recent parameters, [params[0]:1, params[1]:2, etc.] resulted in a reward of 0.00. Maybe those are suboptimal. The best ones seem to be around f=1.00, so I should aim for similar performance.

I think about typical behavior in such games—using an epsilon-greedy approach could help balance between exploration and exploitation. However, since the goal is deterministic rewards, maybe a policy that avoids getting stuck in local maxima is better.

Another thought: some policies might suggest always moving down from (0,3) because of the hole there, which explains why params[4] being 1 (right, down, left) could be problematic. 

I also remember that when near holes, certain actions are avoided, so in states with obstacles, higher action numbers might prevent falling into them. For example, if an agent is on a state where moving up leads to a hole, it should avoid action 2.

Looking at the examples given, params[0]:3 (straight up) and others have some patterns. Maybe using certain actions when adjacent to holes is better than others.

I think I'll go with parameters that show avoidance of immediate hazards while still exploring other paths. A good balance might be params[6] = 1 (right from (2,1)), params[4]=1 (for (0,3)), and others around this area being 3 or higher to avoid falling into holes.
