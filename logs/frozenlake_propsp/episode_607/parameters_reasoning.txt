You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The environment is a 4x4 grid where each cell can be represented as a state from 0 to 15. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) for a reward of +1, and all other states give 0 reward. However, some cells are holes which end the episode with no reward.

The agent's actions aren't straightforward because of the slippery nature. When an action is taken, the agent moves in one of three directions with equal probability. For example, choosing action 0 might lead to down, left, or up. The exact mapping depends on the action chosen.

The policy is represented by a params array of size 16, where each element corresponds to the action taken from that state (0-15). The values can be 0-3, corresponding to the four possible actions.

From the user's message, I see that they've provided some top-performing policies and recent ones. The top policies have average rewards around 0.20 to 0.30, which is below the target of 1.0. This suggests we need to explore more to find a better policy.

The recent policies aren't performing well, with some even getting zero reward. That means those policies might be leading the agent into holes or not reaching the goal efficiently.

Since I'm supposed to act as a stateless optimizer, I can't remember previous attempts. My task is to maximize information gain by either exploring new configurations (if rewards are low) or tweaking the best ones slightly (if close to optimal).

Looking at the top policies, they have varied actions but seem to be moving towards the goal in some way. The recent ones aren't as good, so maybe I should focus on exploring different strategies.

I need to propose a new params configuration that hasn't been tried before and could provide more information about the environment's dynamics, especially regarding the holes.

Perhaps I should design a policy that prioritizes moving towards the goal while avoiding risky moves. For example, from state 0 (top-left), maybe action 2 or 3 would help move right or up/down. But considering the slippery nature, choosing actions that have a higher chance of moving closer to the goal might be better.

Wait, let me think about each state and possible optimal actions. From state 15, we're done, so no action needed. For other states, the best action would depend on their position relative to the goal and the presence of holes.

But since I don't know where the holes are, the policy needs to be robust against them. So, perhaps choosing actions that have a higher probability of avoiding holes while moving towards the goal is key.

Given that each action leads to three possible moves, the policy should choose actions that maximize the chance of reaching the goal without falling into holes based on previous trajectories.

Looking at the recent attempts, some policies led the agent into loops or towards states with low rewards. Maybe adjusting certain states' actions could break those loops and lead towards the goal more directly.

I think I'll propose a new policy where each state's action is chosen to move as close to the goal as possible while considering the slippery nature. For example, in states near the top-right, choosing actions that push towards the right or down might be better.

But without knowing the exact hole positions, it's tricky. So perhaps I should try a policy that systematically moves the agent towards the bottom-right corner by preferring right and down actions when possible.

Let me draft such a policy:

For states in rows above the last row (states 0-7), prefer moving down or right if possible. For states in the last two columns, move right to reach state 15.

Wait, but due to slipping, each action has three possible outcomes. So choosing actions that have a higher chance of moving towards the goal would be better.

Alternatively, maybe using a more balanced approach where from certain states, multiple directions are tried to avoid holes.

I think I'll go with a policy where most states choose actions that can move them right or down, depending on their position. For example:

- From state 0 (top-left), action 1 might help move towards the right.
- From state 1 (top-middle), action 3 could allow moving right or up/down, which might be safer.
- I'll need to map this for each state.

But since it's time-consuming, perhaps a grid-based approach where each cell has an optimal action based on its position. For instance:

States closer to the goal should choose actions that move towards it. Let me try assigning actions in such a way.

Another thought: Maybe using a greedy approach where from each state, the action is chosen to have the highest probability of eventually reaching the goal without hitting a hole. But without knowing the holes, this is speculative.

Given the time constraints, I'll propose a new policy that's different from previous ones, focusing on moving towards the goal while varying actions to explore new trajectories.
