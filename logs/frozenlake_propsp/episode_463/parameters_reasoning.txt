You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to set the parameters for this FrozenLake environment to get the best possible policy. The goal is to maximize the reward by reaching state 15 without falling into any holes. 

First, I remember that each action taken has a 33% chance of going in one of three directions because the environment is slippery. So, choosing an action doesn't guarantee moving in the intended direction. That makes it tricky because the agent's path isn't entirely under its control.

Looking at the state layout: rows are from top to bottom as 0-3, 4-7, 8-11, and 12-15. The goal is state 15, so I want the policy to guide the agent towards that regardless of where it ends up due to the slippery nature.

From the examples given, most policies are resulting in low rewards around 0.30 or less. Since the maximum possible reward is 1.0 (reaching state 15), there's room for improvement. The top-performing params had a 0.30 average, which suggests that they're getting close but not quite there.

The trajectories provided show that some policies are either getting stuck in loops or falling into holes. For example, one trajectory went from (0,1) to (4,2) and then to (8,2), which might be leading towards the goal but hasn't reached it yet. Another trajectory ended quickly by moving right from state 0, but perhaps that's not the optimal path.

I need a policy where each state leads the agent in a direction that statistically increases the chance of reaching state 15 without stepping into holes. Since all actions have equal probabilities, I should consider which directions from each state are more likely to avoid holes and move towards the goal.

Looking at state 0 (top-left corner), possible moves are down, left, or up when action 0 is taken. But moving left isn't helpful because it's the edge. So maybe from state 0, choosing an action that tends to move right or down would be better. However, considering the slippery nature, each action has three possible outcomes.

I think I should design the policy such that each state directs towards a path that statistically avoids holes and progresses toward the goal. For example, in states near the top-left (like 0,1), actions that move downward or rightward might be better. Similarly, for other states, choosing actions that push towards the bottom-right direction.

But without knowing where the holes are exactly, it's challenging. The agent must learn through trial and error which actions lead to failure (holes) versus success. However, in this setup, I'm supposed to propose a policy based on previous data without remembering past attempts.

Given the recent params tried, like params[0]:1 leading to 0.10 reward, perhaps choosing different actions for some states can help. Maybe adjusting certain states' actions to explore new paths that haven't been taken before could yield higher rewards.

I should aim to maximize information gain by selecting a policy that hasn't been tested yet and covers new trajectories. This way, the next iteration can provide more data on which paths are successful or not.

Considering all this, I'll propose a new set of params where each state's action is chosen to push towards the goal while avoiding obvious dead-ends. For instance:

- From state 0 (top-left), choosing an action that mostly moves down (action 0) could help move towards row 1.
- Similarly, for other states, actions are selected to generally move towards the right or bottom.

But without knowing the hole positions, it's a bit of a gamble. However, based on the previous attempts, some patterns might be emerging. For example, if most policies are failing in certain areas, maybe adjusting those specific states' actions could help.

After considering all this, I'll propose a new set of params where each state is assigned an action that statistically increases the chance of moving towards the goal without leading into known problematic paths.
