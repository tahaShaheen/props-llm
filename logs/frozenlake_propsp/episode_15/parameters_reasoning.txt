You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to find the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment using a Q-learning approach with parameter exploration. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right corner) which gives +1 reward. All other states give 0 reward. There are holes in the map that end the game if the agent steps onto them, so I need to explore through history trajectories.

First, I need to understand how the policy parameters work. The params array has elements from index 0 to 15, each corresponding to a state (0-15). Each parameter represents an action: 0 is left, 1 is down, 2 is up, and 3 is right. So for any given state i, I choose the action at params[i] by looking at its value.

The goal is to maximize the expected reward over time, which means avoiding holes and efficiently navigating to the target. Since the environment is slippery, each action has a probability of 1/3 when taking an action. This makes exploration necessary because with deterministic actions, the agent might get stuck in local optima without considering alternative paths.

The top performing parameters provided have a reward of 0.15, but I need to find a better strategy. Since all current parameters are from [0,1,2,3], perhaps I can try all possible combinations and see which one yields the highest rewards on average over time.

I remember that in Q-learning, each state-action pair has an associated value (Q-value), which is updated based on the maximum expected reward considering the next action's outcomes. Since the environment is symmetric, but with holes, some paths are risky or lead to failure, I need to balance between taking safe actions and exploring possible alternative routes.

I think a good approach is to iterate through all possible combinations of the 16 parameters (each from 0-3) except the ones already explored. For each combination, simulate the agent's behavior and calculate the average reward over multiple episodes. Once I find a set of params that consistently gives higher rewards than others, I can declare them as optimal.

I need to make sure not to repeat any parameter sets that were tried before. Since I don't have prior knowledge, I should start with all 4^16 possibilities but in practice, it's too many. Instead, I'll focus on trying combinations where each action is chosen uniformly from [0,3], leading the agent through varied paths.

I'll simulate for 200 more iterations, keeping track of which params lead to higher rewards. Each iteration involves running multiple episodes (like 15) with different parameter sets and averaging their rewards. The combination that consistently gives the highest average reward should be selected as optimal.
