You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment in this RL problem. The goal is to reach state 15, which is the right bottom grid, and that gives a reward of +1. All other states give a reward of 0. There are holes on some grids that can lead to losing the game, meaning if the agent steps onto those, it gets stuck or loses.

The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers where each number corresponds to a state (from 0 to 15). The value of params[i] determines the action when in state i. The actions are 0, 1, 2, and 3, which correspond to specific directions: left, down, right, up.

The policy parameters are currently set to [0.25, 0.75, 0.25, 0.75], but I need to find a better one around [0,1,2,3]. The problem mentions that the global optimal reward should be around None, meaning it's possible to reach the goal with some policy.

I remember that in such environments, exploration is important to avoid getting stuck in local optima. The policy needs to explore states even if they might not seem promising at first glance. Since all actions are considered when a state is visited multiple times, especially with a random selection of actions each time, the agent should have enough interactions to learn the best path.

The policy's exploration strategy is crucial because the action taken should be based on some exploration and maybe some initial knowledge about states. But since it can choose any action for each state, including those that might lead back into holes, I need to make sure that if an action leads to a hole or a loop, it doesn't get stuck.

I think of the standard policy gradient methods like Q-learning or SARSA. In Q-learning, you update based on immediate rewards and next states' values, while SARSA uses temporal differences without needing to store Q-values. Since this is an episodic reward setup, maybe SARSA with experience replay would work well because it doesn't require storing all previous rewards.

Alternatively, using a Boltzmann exploration might help balance exploration and exploitation. But since the policy is deterministic based on params, I need to find parameters that maximize the expected reward without getting stuck in holes.

Maybe starting by testing some random combinations of the policy array would give an idea. For example, setting all actions for even states as 1 and odd states as 2 or vice versa. Or maybe interleaving different action patterns.

I also remember that when a state is revisited multiple times, a uniform distribution among possible actions can help maintain exploration without biasing towards any particular direction. So perhaps the params array should have values spread out more evenly to cover all directions properly.

Another idea: since the agent needs to explore around holes, maybe adding an action that goes straight away or down whenever certain states are revisited could prevent getting stuck. But it's not clear which action would be best without testing different combinations.

I think I'll proceed by randomly selecting some parameters and evaluating how they perform in terms of reward. Since the current params are [0.25, 0.75, 0.25, 0.75], perhaps tweaking these values a bit could help. For example, changing params[1] from 3 to 2 or 4 might give better exploration.

But since I need a deterministic action based on the state's params, I'll have to ensure that when an agent is in a state where all actions lead back into holes or other states it shouldn't fall into, it can choose a different action. Maybe some form of epsilon-greedy could help here—though not sure how to implement that without more data.

Overall, I think the key is to increase exploration by varying the params array more thoroughly and ensuring that when an action leads back into holes or revisiting states that might cause loops, the policy has enough steps to either explore again or find a different path.
