You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me break down what I know.

First, the environment is a 4x4 grid where each state corresponds to a position on the grid. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) which gives a reward of +1. All other states give 0. There are holes that end the episode if stepped on, but I don't know their exact locations yet.

The policy is an array of 16 actions (each from 0-3), where each index represents a state. The challenge is to choose these actions such that the agent avoids holes and reaches the goal as often as possible.

Looking at the previous data provided:

- The top-performing params had an average reward around 0.45, which is significantly below the target of 1.0. This suggests that while they're better than others, they aren't optimal yet.
- The most recent policies have rewards ranging from 0.0 to 0.05, indicating that some attempts are not reaching the goal effectively.

My strategy should focus on maximizing information gain since I can't remember past iterations. Since the current best reward is around 0.45, which is still far below the target of 1.0, I'm in the exploration phase. This means I should propose a policy that's significantly different from previous ones to discover new information about the holes and paths.

I'll look at the recent policies and try to find patterns or areas where changes could lead to better outcomes. For example, if many policies have certain actions leading to failures, changing those might help avoid holes.

I need to ensure each action in the policy avoids leading into a hole with any probability. So, for states near known dangerous areas (like edges), I should choose actions that move towards safer paths or towards the goal more directly.

Let me consider state 0 (top-left corner). Previous policies often chose action 1, which moves right, down, or left with equal chance. Maybe choosing a different action could help. For instance, action 2 might allow moving up, right, or down. Since moving up isn't possible from state 0, it would try to go right or down more.

Looking at the grid, moving right from state 0 leads to state 1, and down leads to state 4. I should choose actions that generally move towards the goal (right and down) but avoid areas with holes.

I'll construct a policy where each state's action is chosen to either move directly towards the goal or in a way that reduces the risk of falling into holes based on known trajectories.

After analyzing, I think setting params[0] to 1 might still be beneficial since it allows moving right. However, for other states, especially those near edges or suspected hole locations, I'll vary the actions more to explore different paths.

Finally, I'll propose a new set of parameters that differ from previous attempts, focusing on avoiding known failing trajectories and encouraging movement towards the goal while exploring alternative routes.
