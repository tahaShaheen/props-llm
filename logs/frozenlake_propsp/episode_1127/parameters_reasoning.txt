You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 1127 out of 5000. OUTPUT ONLY THIS SINGLE LINE:

Do NOT output anything else. No explanation, no reasoning, nothing.



LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get an average reward of around 1.0, which means reaching state 15 most of the time without falling into any holes. 

Looking at the provided data, the top params have f(params) values between 0.35 and 0.45. That's not very high, so I'm probably in the exploration phase since we're nowhere near the target reward of 1.0.

I need to generate a new set of params that hasn't been tried before. The previous attempts seem to have some consistency but aren't leading to the goal efficiently. Maybe there are certain states where the current policies are causing loops or getting stuck near holes.

Let me think about the structure of the grid. State 15 is at the bottom right, so moving towards that makes sense. Since the environment is slippery, actions might not lead directly to the intended state. So the policy needs to account for possible movements in different directions.

In the previous examples, some policies are taking action 0 or 2 multiple times, which could be causing unintended movements. Maybe I should vary the actions more to explore other paths.

I'll start by assigning different actions to each state, ensuring that we're not repeating any previous params configuration. For example, in state 0 (top left), if previous policies used action 1 or 2, maybe using a different action here could lead to new trajectories.

Looking at the most recent attempts, some ended up with zero reward, which means they fell into holes. So I need to adjust those states' actions to avoid leading towards the holes.

For state 0, trying action 3 might be better since it moves left, right, or up, avoiding potential paths that lead down to a hole. Similarly, for other edge states, choosing actions that keep the agent moving towards the goal without getting stuck near holes is crucial.

I'll go through each state and assign an action that differs from previous configurations, ensuring we maximize exploration while trying to reach the goal efficiently.
