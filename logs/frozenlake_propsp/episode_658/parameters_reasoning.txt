You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what the best policy is for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15, which gives a reward of +1, and avoid the holes. Since the environment is slippery, each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability.

Looking at the problem description, I need to define a policy where each state (from 0 to 15) maps to one of four actions (0-3). The tricky part is that when an action is taken, there's a 33% chance to go in any of three directions. So, for each state, the agent has to choose an action that maximizes the chances of reaching the goal without falling into a hole.

First, I should figure out which states are holes. The user didn't specify them directly, but from the trajectories provided, it seems like certain paths lead to failures (rewards of 0). For example, some policies result in trajectories that end quickly, possibly because they fell into a hole.

Looking at the top-performing params, their average reward is around 0.35, which is lower than the target of 1.0. That suggests there's room for improvement. The most recent policies have even worse rewards (0.00), indicating that those might be bad choices or they're leading to holes.

Since I'm supposed to act as a stateless optimizer, I need to focus on maximizing information gain each step without remembering past attempts. My goal is to propose a new policy that explores different actions, especially in states where previous policies haven't performed well.

I'll start by analyzing the trajectories provided. For instance, one trajectory goes (0,1) → (4,2) → (8,2). This suggests that from state 0 taking action 1 leads to state 4 with some probability, but it's not reaching the goal quickly. Another trajectory ends at state 8 after a few steps.

I think I should design a policy that tries to move towards the goal (state 15) as directly as possible while avoiding risky moves that might lead into holes. Since each action has multiple outcomes, I need to choose actions that have the highest probability of moving closer to the goal or staying safe.

Let me consider each state and decide which action would be best:

- State 0: To move towards the right (action 1) or down (action 0). But since it's slippery, maybe choosing an action that has a higher chance to go right or down. Looking at the action definitions:
  - Action 0 leads to [down, left, up]. Down from 0 takes you to state 4.
  - Action 1 leads to [right, down, left]. Right would take you to state 1.

Since moving right (state 1) might be closer to the goal than going down (state 4), perhaps action 1 is better for state 0.

- State 1: Similarly, choosing actions that move towards the right or down. Action 3 might have a higher chance of moving up or right.

Wait, but in state 1, what's the best way? The goal is at (3,3), so ideally, moving right or down. Let me see action definitions again:
- Action 0: [down, left, up]
- Action 1: [right, down, left]
- Action 2: [up, right, down]
- Action 3: [left, up, right]

So for state 1, if I choose action 2 (which includes right and down), that might help in moving towards the goal.

But I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to look at each state's possible moves and pick actions that have a higher chance of leading towards the goal without hitting holes.

Another approach is to set up a policy that tries to move towards the right or down as much as possible, given the slippery nature.

Let me try to outline a basic greedy policy:

- For states in row 0 (top row), prefer moving right or down.
- For states in column 3 (rightmost column), prefer moving down.
- Avoid actions that could lead left or up when near the edges.

But considering the slipperiness, each action has three possible moves. So, I need to choose actions that maximize the chance of getting closer to the goal.

For example:

- State 0: Choosing action 1 (right) might be better because it can move right, down, or left. But moving left would take it back to state 3, which is not helpful.
- Similarly, state 3 could choose an action that moves towards the right.

Wait, but in state 3 (top row, column 3), choosing action 1 might help as it can move right (but that's a hole?), down, or left. Hmm, without knowing the exact holes, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps I should focus on setting up a policy where each state has an action that tries to go towards the goal with higher probability.

Another thought: Maybe using Q-learning-like approach, but since I can't remember past steps, each proposal must be based solely on maximizing information.

Given that all previous policies have low rewards, maybe it's better to try a completely different set of actions. For example, making state 0 choose action 2 instead of 1 or 3.

Wait, looking at the recent params:

In one case, params[0] was 2. Let me see what that did. The trajectory started with (0,3), so action 3 for state 0. Action 3's possible moves are left, up, right. From state 0, moving left would stay in 0, up is invalid (assuming grid doesn't wrap around?), or right to state 1.

Wait, but from the initial state 0, which is top-left corner, moving up isn't possible—probably stays in place or wraps? Or maybe it's considered as a hole. That could be why some trajectories end quickly when taking certain actions.

So perhaps for state 0, choosing an action that doesn't have up as an option might be safer. Actions 1 and 3 include up as a possibility, while action 0 includes left, which stays in the same row but moves down.

Wait, no: Action 0 from state 0 is [down (to 4), left (stays at 0?), or up (invalid)]. If up is invalid, perhaps it wraps around? Or maybe moving up from state 0 leads to a hole. That could be why some policies fail when taking action 1 or 3 from state 0.

So, if I choose action 0 for state 0, the possible moves are down, left (stays), or up (invalid, possibly a hole). So choosing action 0 might risk falling into a hole if up is invalid. Alternatively, maybe action 1 is better because it includes moving right, which is safe.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to map out the grid:

States are 0-3: top row (row 0)
4-7: second row
8-11: third row
12-15: bottom row

Each state can be mapped as follows:
State i = row * 4 + column.

So, for example, state 0 is (0,0), state 3 is (0,3), state 4 is (1,0), etc.

Possible moves from each state:

From any state, moving up decreases the row by 1 if possible.
Moving down increases the row by 1 if possible.
Left decreases column by 1 if possible.
Right increases column by 1 if possible.

If the move would take you outside the grid, perhaps it's a hole. So, for example:

- From state 0 (0,0), moving left or up would be out of bounds. Therefore, those moves might lead to holes.
- Similarly, from state 3 (0,3), moving right or up could lead to a hole.

Therefore, in the policy, I should avoid actions that include these invalid moves for edge states.

So, let's reconsider each action's possible moves:

Action 0: [down, left, up]
From state 0, this would mean:
- down → 4
- left → 3 (but from 0, left is to same row, column -1? Which might be a hole)
- up → invalid, which could be a hole.

So taking action 0 from state 0 has a risk of falling into a hole if the agent tries to move left or up.

Similarly, action 1: [right, down, left]
From state 0:
- right → 1
- down →4
- left →3 (which might be a hole)

Action 2: [up, right, down]
From state 0:
- up → invalid (hole)
- right →1
- down→4

Action 3: [left, up, right]
From state 0:
- left → same as action 0's left
- up → hole
- right →1

So, for state 0, the safest action is probably action 1 or 2 because they include moving right and down, which are valid. However, both have a 33% chance to move left (action 1) or up (actions 2 and 3), which could lead to holes.

Wait, but if I choose action 1 for state 0, it can go right to 1, down to 4, or left to 3. But moving left from 0 would stay in the same row but column -1? Or perhaps it's a hole.

Assuming that moving left from state 0 leads to a hole (as it's out of bounds), then taking action 1 has a 33% chance of falling into a hole, which is bad. Similarly for action 2 and 3.

So maybe the best strategy is to choose actions that have less risky possible moves. For example, from state 0, choosing an action that doesn't include moving left or up.

Wait, but all actions from state 0 include either left or up as a possibility because:

- Action 0: down, left, up
- Action 1: right, down, left
- Action 2: up, right, down
- Action 3: left, up, right

So any action from state 0 has a chance of moving into a hole. Therefore, the agent must choose an action that maximizes the probability of moving towards the goal while minimizing the risk.

Perhaps the optimal approach is to move towards the right as much as possible since it's closer to the goal. But given the slipperiness, maybe choosing actions that have a higher chance of going right or down.

But I'm not sure. Maybe looking at the previous policies can help. The top policy had params[0] =1, which is action 1 (right, down, left). So in that case, from state 0, it's trying to go right but has a risk of falling into a hole on the left.

But in some trajectories, taking action 1 from state 0 led to moving to state 4. For example, trajectory: (0,1) → (4,2). So when action 1 was taken, the agent moved down instead of right or left.

Hmm, perhaps I need a different approach. Maybe using dynamic programming to compute the optimal policy considering the probabilities.

But since I'm supposed to propose a policy without knowing where the holes are exactly, it's challenging. However, based on the trajectories provided, certain actions in certain states lead to failures quickly, which suggests those states have holes nearby.

For example, from state 0, taking action 3 leads to (0,3) as per one trajectory, which might be a hole or not. If that's the case, perhaps avoiding actions that would take you to known failing states is better.

Given all this uncertainty, I think the best approach is to propose a policy that tries to move towards the goal with high probability while avoiding moves that could lead into holes.

So, for each state, I'll try to choose an action that has the highest chance of moving closer to the goal (state 15). For example:

- States in row 0: prefer moving right
- States in column 3: prefer moving down
- Other states: prefer moving towards the goal based on current position

But considering the slipperiness, each action will have a 33% chance of three directions. So, for example, in state 1 (top row, column 1), choosing an action that includes right and down would be better.

Alternatively, perhaps using a policy gradient approach where each action's value is estimated based on past rewards, but since I can't remember previous policies, I have to maximize information gain.

Given the current buffer shows low rewards, maybe it's best to try a completely different policy. For example, setting all states to action 1 or 2, which encourage moving right and down.

But looking at recent params, several had high numbers like 3, but their rewards were poor. So perhaps choosing lower actions would be better.

Wait, let me think of the optimal path: starting from state 0, you want to move towards state 15 (right-bottom). The direct path is right, right, down, down or similar.

But due to slipperiness, each action can take you in three directions. So a policy that tries to maximize moving right and down would be ideal.

For example:

- For states where column <3, prefer actions that have right as an option.
- For states where row <3, prefer actions that have down as an option.

Looking back at the action definitions:

Action 1: [right, down, left]
So for state i where you want to move right or down, action 1 could be good because it includes both right and down.

Similarly, action 2: [up, right, down] which includes right and down but also up (which might not be desired if near the top).

Action 3: [left, up, right], which includes left and right but also up.

So for states in row 0, avoiding actions that include up is better to avoid holes. Therefore:

- For state 0 (row 0, column 0): action 1 is [right, down, left]. But moving left could lead to a hole. So perhaps action 2 would be better as it includes right and down but also up (which might not be desired). Alternatively, maybe there's no safe way without risking holes.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe the best approach is to choose actions that have a higher chance of moving towards the goal while minimizing the risk of falling into holes based on previous trajectories.

Looking at the top policies:

The first top policy had params[0]=1, which led to trajectory (0,1) → (4,2). So from state 0, taking action 1 resulted in moving down to state 4. That suggests that for state 0, action 1 is possible and doesn't immediately fall into a hole.

Similarly, another top policy had params[0]=2, which led to trajectory (0,3) → (1,3), etc. So taking action 2 from state 0 leads to moving up or right or down. But if up is a hole, that could be bad.

Wait, no: action 2 from state 0 includes [up, right, down]. If up is invalid, then it's a hole, so the agent would have a 33% chance of falling into a hole when taking action 2 from state 0. So perhaps choosing action 1 for state 0 is better because it doesn't include up.

Therefore, I think setting params[0] to 1 might be safer as it only includes right, down, and left (but left could lead to a hole). But if the agent takes action 1 from state 0, moving down or right are valid, while left leads to a hole. So with 2/3 chance of moving towards the goal and 1/3 falling into a hole.

But since previous policies have low rewards, maybe it's better to try a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps choosing action 3 for state 0 would be better because it includes right and left but also up (which is risky). Hmm, not sure.

Given all this, I think the best approach is to propose a policy that tries to move towards the goal as much as possible while avoiding actions that could lead into holes. For example:

- States in row 0: choose action 1 or 2
- States in column 3: choose action 0 or 3
- Other states: choose actions that include moving right or down

But without knowing the exact hole positions, it's hard to be precise.

Wait, another thought: The optimal policy should have an average reward close to 1.0. Since previous policies have lower rewards, perhaps the current best is not optimal yet. So I need to propose a policy that explores new actions, especially in states where previous policies haven't performed well.

Looking at the recent params, several had high numbers like 3, but their rewards were 0. Maybe it's better to try setting some states to lower actions (like 0 or 1) to see if that helps.

For example, let me propose a policy where most states choose action 1 or 2, which include moving right and down, except for edge cases.

But I need to make sure the proposed params are unique and haven't been tried before. From the top 4 best performing, their params vary but none seem identical.

Given that, perhaps I can propose a new set of params where each state chooses an action that primarily moves towards the goal while considering the slipperiness.

After considering all this, I'll propose a new policy where:

- For states in row 0: choose action 1 (right and down)
- For states in column 3: choose action 2 or 3 to move down
- Other states: choose actions that include moving right or down

But without knowing the exact holes, it's challenging. However, based on previous trajectories, avoiding actions that lead into known failing paths is crucial.

So, I'll create a params array where:

params[0] =1 (action 1), to move right or down
params[1]=2 (action 2), includes up, right, down
...
But this might not be the best. Alternatively, perhaps setting all states to action 3 except for certain ones.

Wait, I think I need a more systematic approach. Let me try to assign actions based on maximizing the chance of moving towards the goal:

- States in row 0: prefer moving right (action 1)
- States in column <3: prefer moving right
- States in column=3: prefer moving down

But again, considering slipperiness.

Alternatively, perhaps use a policy where each state chooses an action that has the highest chance to move towards the goal. For example:

For each state, evaluate which action's possible moves have the highest probability of leading closer to the goal.

Given the grid and the goal at (3,3), for each state (row, col):

- If row <3 and col <3: prefer moving right or down
- If row ==3: move right until col=3
- If col==3: move down

But since actions are probabilistic, it's not straightforward.

After all this thinking, I'll propose a new policy where:

params[0] = 1 (action 1)
params[1] = 2
...
Wait, perhaps the best is to set all states to action 2 except for certain ones. Alternatively, let me make a specific proposal based on trying to move right and down.

But considering time constraints, I'll propose a policy where most states choose action 1 or 2, aiming to move towards the goal while avoiding risky moves.
