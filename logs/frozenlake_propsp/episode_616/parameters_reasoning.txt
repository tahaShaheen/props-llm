You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with as high a reward as possible, avoiding holes along the way. The agent's actions are slippery, meaning each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability. 

From the problem description, I know that the top-performing policies so far have an average reward around 0.30, which is not too bad but there's room for improvement. The optimal should be close to 1.0, so we need to find a way to maximize reaching state 15 without falling into any holes.

Looking at the recent parameters provided, I see that some policies are getting stuck in loops or not progressing towards the goal effectively. For example, one of the trajectories showed the agent repeating actions and not moving closer to the target. This suggests that the current policies might be either taking paths that lead back to previous states or aren't directing the agent towards the goal efficiently.

I also notice that some policies are exploring different actions but not consistently making progress. To improve this, I should consider a policy that guides the agent towards state 15 with minimal chances of falling into holes. This might involve setting up a path that's more direct and reduces the risk of slipping into dangerous areas.

One strategy could be to have the agent try to move right or down as much as possible since those directions are likely to lead towards the goal (state 15 is at the bottom-right). However, because of the slippery nature, each action has a 33% chance of going in any direction, so I need to choose actions that maximize the probability of moving towards the goal even when considering the slipperiness.

Looking at state transitions, for example, from state 0 (top-left), if we take action 1 (right, down, left), the agent can move right with some chance. Similarly, in other states, choosing actions that have a higher chance to move towards the goal could be beneficial. But since each action leads to three possible moves, I need to select actions that cover the most promising directions.

I also recall from the problem statement that holes are present, but their exact locations aren't specified. So, the policy needs to avoid any actions that might lead into these unknown holes. This suggests that a cautious approach towards the edges where holes might be located is necessary.

Given all this, I think a good starting point would be to set up policies that encourage moving right and down in states where possible, while avoiding actions that could loop or move away from the goal. For example, states near the top-right should push more towards down, while those on the left should push towards right.

So, for each state, I'll assign an action that increases the likelihood of moving towards the bottom-right direction. Let's consider each state:

- State 0 (0,0): Can move down to 4 or right to 1 with equal probability if action is 1.
- State 1 (0,1): Action 3 might help move left, up, or right. But moving towards the goal would be down (to 5) or right (state 2).
- ... and so on for each state.

But since I can't remember previous attempts due to being stateless, I'll have to propose a policy that explores new configurations but is also informed by what's worked before.

Looking at the recent top params, some are taking action 3 in certain states which might lead towards right or up. Maybe combining these with more direct actions could help.

I think it's time to propose a new set of parameters that guide the agent more directly toward state 15 while minimizing chances of falling into holes. I'll set each state's action based on what would move the agent closer to the goal, considering the possible slips.
