You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I need to find the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment described. The goal is to maximize the reward by reaching state 15, avoiding holes. 

First, understanding the problem: it's a 4x4 grid with slippery movement. Each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability. The policy is an array of 16 elements (params), each representing the action taken in states 0-15.

The optimal reward should be around 1.0, meaning the agent reliably reaches state 15 without falling into holes.

Looking at the provided examples and trajectories, it seems like the current policies aren't achieving high rewards—most are around 0.15 or lower. This suggests that previous attempts might not have found a path to the goal efficiently or have fallen into traps.

As an explorer, since the rewards are low, I should propose a new policy that's significantly different from previous ones to gather more information.

I'll consider designing a policy where each state chooses actions that maximize the chance of moving towards the goal (state 15) while avoiding holes. For example, states near the bottom-right might move right or down, but considering the slippery nature, I need to account for possible drifts.

Wait, actually, in this environment, each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability. So, the policy needs to choose actions that have a higher chance of leading towards state 15 without getting stuck in holes.

Looking at the grid:

- State 0: top-left (0,0)
- ...
- State 15: bottom-right (3,3)

To reach state 15, from state 14 (which is (3,2)), moving right would take to 15. But because of slippiness, choosing the action that has a higher probability of moving right or down.

Alternatively, for each state, I should choose actions that push towards the goal considering possible movements.

But since movement is probabilistic, perhaps using a more systematic approach like value iteration could help, but given the constraints, I can only propose one policy at a time.

Given that previous policies didn't yield high rewards, I'll try to vary the actions across different states. For example, in state 0 (top-left), choosing action 1 might push it towards right or down. Similarly, for other states, selecting actions that have a higher chance of moving toward state 15.

Let me draft a possible policy:

- States near the bottom-right should prefer right and down.
- Middle states should try to move in directions that can lead closer to the goal.
- Avoiding holes requires knowing their locations, but since I don't have info on where they are, I'll assume some positions are dangerous.

Wait, actually, the problem mentions that the agent must avoid holes by learning from previous trajectories. So, if a trajectory led to a hole, the policy should be adjusted to avoid similar paths.

But without knowing which states are holes, it's tricky. Maybe focus on getting to state 15 reliably.

Let me think of a possible path:

From state 0 (top-left), actions that move down or right would help progress towards the goal.

Looking at the example where params[0]:2; etc., but their reward was 0.25, which is better than others but still low.

Maybe I can try setting states near the bottom row to always move right, and those near the rightmost column to move down.

Alternatively, since movement is slippery, perhaps using a policy that's less sensitive to direction—like choosing actions that have a mix of moves that could bring closer to 15.

Given all this, I'll propose a new set of params where each state chooses an action that tries to head towards the goal. For example:

- States in the top row: prefer right or down.
- Middle rows: choose actions that move towards increasing column and row numbers.
- Bottom-right states: stay put or move in directions that can't go wrong.

But without knowing exact hole locations, it's challenging. Alternatively, I could use a random selection but ensure each state has varied actions to explore new trajectories.

Wait, the example with params[0]:1; ... had reward 0.20. Maybe trying different combinations for states near the edges.

Alternatively, perhaps setting all states to move right or down as much as possible. Let's try that:

params = [1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3, 0, 2, 1, 0, 3, 2]

Wait, not sure. Maybe a better approach is to set each state's action based on moving towards the goal direction.

But since I can't remember previous attempts except what's in the buffer, I'll try varying the actions across different states to maximize information gain.

Let me propose:

params[0] = 1 (right or down)
params[1] = 3 (left, up, right—mix)
... but not sure. Alternatively, set each state to choose an action that has a higher chance of moving towards increasing row and column.

Alternatively, for each state i:

If it's in the top row (0-3), prefer down or right.
If in the bottom row (12-15), prefer right or up?
Wait, no, 12 is the bottom-left. So from 12, moving right would go to 13, and then to 14, then 15.

So for state 12: action that can move right, down, or up. Since it's the bottom row, moving down isn't possible (would stay?), but movement is slippery, so maybe choosing actions that have a chance to go right.

Alternatively, considering the slippiness, each action leads to three possible moves, which complicates things.

I think I'll go with a policy where each state chooses an action that attempts to move towards the goal in the most direct way possible. For example:

- From any state not in the last column (states 0-3,4-7,8-11), prefer right or down.
- From states in the last column (12-15), choose actions that can't go further right but might stay or move up/down.

But without knowing holes, it's hard to avoid them. So perhaps a more randomized approach is better for exploration.

Alternatively, I could set all even-numbered states to one action and odd to another to vary the trajectories.

Wait, given time constraints, perhaps I should propose a new policy that varies significantly from previous ones. Looking at the most recent params:

Recent params had f(params) around 0.15, which is low. So trying a different approach.

Let me set all states to choose action 2 (which includes up, right, down). This way, movement has a chance to go in multiple directions, increasing exploration.

So params would be [2]*16. But I need to ensure each param is from 0-3. Alternatively, vary some of them.

Wait, but the initial example had some states with action 2 and others with different actions.

Alternatively, perhaps set states closer to the goal to have specific actions while others explore more.

Given all this, I'll propose a new policy where most states choose action 1 or 3 to encourage movement towards the right and down directions, which are essential for reaching state 15.
