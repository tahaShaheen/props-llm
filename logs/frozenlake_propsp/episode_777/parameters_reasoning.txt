You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with as much reward as possible, but there are holes that can end the episode if stepped on. The agent's actions are slippery, meaning each action has a 33% chance of moving in one of three directions.

Looking at the problem, I need to find a policy that maximizes the expected reward. The optimal reward is around 1.0, which means reaching the goal consistently.

First, I notice that the environment is 4x4, so each state from 0 to 15 represents a grid cell. The agent can move in four directions, but due to the slipperiness, each action has three possible outcomes with equal probability.

The trajectories provided show some patterns. For example, when params[0] is set to 2, the trajectory starts at (0,2) and then moves to (1,0). This suggests that from state 0, choosing action 2 might be leading towards the goal but perhaps getting stuck or hitting a hole.

In the most recent parameters, some policies are giving low rewards. For instance, one policy resulted in a reward of 0.0 with a trajectory that meandered without reaching the goal. Another gave 0.10 by moving down and then right, but it didn't reach the end.

I need to consider how each state's action contributes to avoiding holes and progressing towards the goal. The key is to identify which actions from each state are safest (i.e., don't lead into holes) while increasing the probability of reaching state 15.

From previous top-performing params, some configurations have higher rewards like 0.45. These might be closer to the optimal policy but perhaps aren't quite there yet. I should look for ways to tweak these parameters slightly or explore new ones if necessary.

Since we're at iteration 777 and the goal is around 1.0, it's time to act as an optimizer. This means adjusting the best-performing policies to see if they can achieve higher rewards.

Looking at the params with f(params) = 0.45, perhaps tweaking some actions in critical states could help. For example, maybe changing the action from state 7 or 12 could lead to a more direct path towards the goal without hitting holes.

Alternatively, considering the slipperiness, it's essential that each action has a high probability of moving towards the goal without falling into holes. So, I need to ensure that from each state, the chosen action has at least one safe direction and avoids leading towards known holes.

In some cases, moving in certain directions might lead to states where all possible next steps are either holes or further away from the goal. Thus, it's crucial for each policy to navigate such paths carefully.

I should also look at the trajectories provided. For instance, a trajectory that goes (0,1) → (4,2) → (8,2) might be getting stuck in loops or not moving efficiently towards the goal. Adjusting the actions from these states could help break the loop and progress further.

Considering all this, I think it's best to propose a policy where each state's action is chosen to maximize the chance of moving towards the goal while minimizing the risk of falling into holes. This might involve setting certain actions in key states (like near the top or left side) to push more directly towards the right or bottom.

After analyzing, I'll choose a new set of params that slightly differs from previous high-reward policies but maintains the structure that leads closer to the goal. For example, changing some action selections in states 0-3 and 4-7 to encourage rightward movement might help reach state 15 more effectively.
