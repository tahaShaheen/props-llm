You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, let's try to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. So, I'm supposed to come up with a set of parameters that maximize the episodic reward, which ideally should be around 1.0 if we find the optimal path.

First, understanding the environment is crucial. It's a 4x4 grid where the goal is state 15. The movement is tricky because each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability due to the slippery nature of the ice. That adds a layer of uncertainty because choosing an action doesn't guarantee moving in that direction.

Looking at the provided data, it seems like several policies have been tested, but none have achieved the optimal reward yet. The best so far is 0.45, which is still below 1.0. So, we need to explore more effective strategies.

I notice that some trajectories end quickly, either by reaching the goal or falling into a hole. For example, one trajectory went from state 0 to action 1 (right), then to state 4, and so on. But it didn't reach the goal, which suggests that maybe certain actions aren't leading towards the target effectively.

Given that the agent can move in three directions with each action, perhaps we need to adjust the policy to account for these probabilities. For instance, if from a particular state, taking an action that has a high chance of moving towards the goal would be beneficial.

Let me think about each state and what actions could lead closer to the goal. State 0 is (0,0), so it's the top-left corner. From here, moving right or down might help progress towards state 15. However, because of the slippery nature, choosing an action that increases the likelihood of moving in the desired direction is key.

Looking at previous params, many have been using action 1 for state 0, which corresponds to [right, down, left]. But maybe switching to action 3 (which includes right, up, and left) could help avoid going back or staying in place. Alternatively, action 2 (up, right, down) might be better as it covers moving right and down.

Similarly, for other states, we need to ensure that the actions chosen don't lead into holes but instead move towards the goal. For example, state 15 is already the goal, so any action taken there should probably stay put or not risk falling into a hole, but since it's the target, perhaps no action is needed.

Given the current policies tested and their trajectories, I think we need to vary the actions more strategically. Maybe some states are getting stuck in loops or moving away from the goal. Adjusting the policy to encourage movement towards the right and down directions might help, considering that state 15 is at the bottom-right.

I should also consider avoiding holes. For instance, certain states near the edges or corners might have higher risks of falling into holes if not navigated carefully. So, the policy needs to be aware of these risks and choose actions that minimize the chance of stepping into a hole while still progressing towards the goal.

Perhaps using a more aggressive approach in some areas and a cautious one in others could balance exploration and exploitation. For example, near the top row, moving down might be safer than right, especially if there are holes on the right side.

I should also look at the trajectories provided to see where the agent is failing. For instance, a trajectory that goes from (0,1) to (4,3) suggests that it moved down and then left or something similar, but didn't reach the goal. Maybe adjusting the action for state 4 could help.

In summary, I need to create a policy where each state's action is chosen to maximize the chance of moving towards the goal while avoiding holes. This might involve setting specific actions for key states like 0, 7, 12, and others near the edges or holes.
