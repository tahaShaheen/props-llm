You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. It's a 4x4 grid with slippery movements and some holes. The goal is to reach state 15 with the highest reward possible, which should be around 1.0 if we're optimal.

Looking at the problem description, each action taken by the agent doesn't directly lead to the intended movement because of the slipperiness. Instead, when you take an action, there's a 33% chance it goes in one of three directions depending on which action was chosen.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 values (params[0] to params[15]), each corresponding to a state and indicating the action to take. The challenge is to set these params such that the agent maximizes its reward, avoiding holes and reaching the goal as efficiently as possible.

From the user's message, I see that in previous iterations, several policies were tested, but they all yielded relatively low rewards (around 0.1 or 0.05). The top-performing ones had some trajectories leading to either falling into holes or not reaching the goal quickly enough.

Since we're at iteration 95 out of 5000, there's still a lot of room for exploration and optimization. But given that all previous attempts have low rewards, it suggests that the optimal policy hasn't been found yet. Therefore, as per the user's instructions, I should focus on being an "Explorer" because the current rewards are far below 1.0.

As an Explorer, my goal is to propose a new set of params that's significantly different from previous ones to gather more information about which areas of the state space might lead to better outcomes. This means varying the actions in states where previous policies have been consistent but haven't yielded high rewards.

I'll start by looking at the most recent params provided and see if I can change some actions to explore new paths. For example, in the last few iterations, many policies had params[0] set to 1 or 2. Maybe trying a different action here could lead the agent towards a new trajectory that avoids holes or reaches the goal faster.

I also need to ensure that the proposed params haven't been used before, as per point 1 of the user's instructions. So I'll check against the top 6 and recent 4 params to make sure there are no duplicates.

After considering these factors, I think setting some states to choose different actions could help explore new territories. For example, changing certain states from their usual action (like switching from right or down to up) might lead the agent towards less-traveled paths that avoid holes and get closer to the goal.

So, based on all this, I'll propose a new set of params where several key states have different actions than before, aiming to maximize information gain by exploring new trajectories.
