You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

Do NOT output anything else. No explanation, no reasoning, nothing.



LLM:
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to propose the next set of parameters for the FrozenLake environment. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward by reaching state 15, which gives a +1 reward. All other states give 0, and some are holes that end the episode.

First, I need to understand the current situation. The user provided top 5 best performing params with rewards around 0.45 to 0.35. The most recent 4 params all have low rewards, mostly 0.0 or 0.05. This suggests that the exploration phase is ongoing and hasn't found a policy that consistently reaches the goal.

The key is to maximize information gain since I can't remember previous attempts. I should focus on proposing parameters that will either help identify new trajectories or optimize around high-reward regions if they exist.

Looking at the top params, they seem to be trying different actions in various states. For example, state 0 often uses action 1 (right), and state 4 might use action 2 (up) or 0 (down). However, their rewards aren't great, so perhaps we need to explore more thoroughly.

I should look for states that are crucial for reaching the goal but have been underexplored. For example, if certain states near the goal are not being reached because of bad policies, adjusting those could help.

Given that all recent attempts are low reward, I'm in the "Explorer" phase. So, I need to pick a parameter set distinct from what's been tried before to capture new information.

I'll check which params have been used so far and ensure my next proposal is different. For instance, if many policies use action 1 for state 0, maybe trying another action could help.

Let me think about each state:

- State 0: Top-left corner. From here, moving right (action 1) is common but may lead to other states. Maybe trying down or up could explore different paths.
- States in the first row (0-3): They might need to move towards the goal without falling into holes.

I should vary some key states. For example, state 12 is near the bottom-left; perhaps changing its action from recent attempts could help navigate better.

Let me try creating a new params array, making sure each value is unique from previous top and recent ones where possible.

After considering, I'll set some states to different actions, ensuring no repetition with prior policies. For instance, state 0 might use action 3 (left) or 2 (up), which could change the trajectory.

Wait, but moving left from state 0 is not possible as it's already on the edge. So action 3 (which includes up, right, and down) would have equal probabilities. Maybe that's better than always going right.

I think I'll adjust several states to actions that haven't been tried much, ensuring each change introduces new exploration paths. This should help in finding a trajectory that leads to the goal without falling into holes.
