You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, let me try to figure out what the best next step is for this problem. So, from what I understand, we're dealing with a FrozenLake environment that's 4x4. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right corner) and get a reward of +1. All other states give 0, but there are holes which end the episode if stepped on.

The user has provided some previous attempts and their corresponding rewards. Looking at the top 6 best performing params, they all have an average reward around 0.35 to 0.45. That's significantly below the target of 1.0, so we're definitely in exploration mode here since the rewards aren't close to optimal.

The recent params show that some configurations are getting very low rewards, even 0.00, which suggests that those policies might be leading into holes or not reaching the goal effectively. So, I need to propose a new set of params that explore different paths and avoid the holes.

Looking at the trajectories, it seems like certain states are problematic. For example, state 0 (top-left) is often leading to moves that either stay in place or lead towards other dangerous areas. Maybe adjusting the actions for state 0 could help. Instead of moving right (action 1), perhaps moving down (action 0) would be better since it leads directly towards the goal.

Also, states near the edges might have higher risks of falling into holes. So, ensuring that from those states, the policy guides the agent towards safe paths is crucial. For instance, state 3 (top-right) should probably avoid moving up and instead move right or down to stay within the grid and not fall into a hole.

I'll try creating a new set of params where each state's action is chosen to either move directly towards the goal or choose directions that minimize the risk of falling into holes. For example, in states closer to the bottom-right corner, actions should encourage moving right or down. In other areas, maybe alternating between different moves to explore paths.

I'll make sure each params[i] is set to a value from 0-3 and ensure that this new configuration hasn't been tried before based on the provided history. The goal is to maximize information gain by testing a new strategy that might yield higher rewards.
