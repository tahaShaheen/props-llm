You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment to maximize the reward. The agent needs to reach state 15 (the bottom right corner) and avoid the holes. Since the environment is slippery, each action has a 33% chance of moving in one of three directions.

First, I'll recall that the grid is 4x4 with states numbered from 0 to 15. The goal is state 15. The policy is an array of 16 actions where each element corresponds to a state and can be 0,1,2,3. The challenge is to avoid holes while moving towards the goal.

Looking at the top 6 best-performing params provided, their average reward is around 0.30, which isn't very high. So maybe we're not close to the optimal policy yet since the global optimal should be around 1.0.

The recent parameters have rewards ranging from 0.00 to 0.25, indicating that there's a lot of room for improvement. Most trajectories either get stuck in loops or fall into holes quickly.

I need to think about how each state should behave. For states closer to the goal (like states 12-15), the policy should push towards moving right and down since those lead to the goal. But because of the slipperiness, we have to choose actions that give a higher chance of moving in the desired direction.

For example, if an agent is at state 0 (top-left corner), it might try to move right or down. Since action 1 (right) and action 0 (down) are both possible but with only 33% each, perhaps choosing the action that covers more paths towards the goal.

Wait, let's consider each state:

- State 0: can go down to 4, left is invalid, up invalid. So action 0 would move down most of the time, which is good as it moves towards the bottom.
- Similarly, other states should have actions that guide them towards 15 while avoiding holes.

Holes are not specified, but based on the trajectories, certain states might lead to failure. For example, state 3 (top-middle) if moved left could go into a hole, so action choices there must be careful.

I think a greedy approach where each state chooses an action that maximizes the chance of moving closer to the goal would work best. However, because of the slippery nature, we have to consider all possible next states and choose actions that, on average, lead towards the goal without falling into holes.

Looking at previous params, many had low rewards, so perhaps they didn't navigate effectively or fell into traps. Maybe I should focus on creating a path that goes right and down as much as possible, avoiding left and up unless necessary.

Another thought: since each action has three possible outcomes, the policy must account for all possibilities. For example, from state 15 (goal), any action is irrelevant because it's terminal, but we can set params[15] to any value, though ideally, it shouldn't matter once reached.

So, perhaps setting up a path that navigates right and down as much as possible without getting stuck or falling into holes. For each state, the optimal action would be the one that has the highest chance of moving towards the goal while avoiding risky moves that could lead to holes.

I should also note that since the environment is slippery, sometimes the agent might move in a direction it didn't intend, so planning for all possibilities is crucial.

After considering all this, I think setting up a policy where each state directs the agent towards the right or down as much as possible would be optimal. Maybe prioritizing moving down when on the top two rows and moving right when on the leftmost columns.
