You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to find the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment that maximizes the episodic reward. From what I understand, the agent navigates a 4x4 grid where each action has a 1/3 probability of moving in three directions due to slipperiness. The target is state 15 (bottom-right corner), which gives +1 reward, while all other states give 0. Holes are present, and stepping on them ends the episode with no reward.

First, I need to consider how the agent can reach the goal without falling into holes. Since the environment is slippery, actions don't always result in the intended move. This means that the policy must account for the probabilistic nature of movements.

Looking at the provided top 6 best-performing params and their trajectories, it seems like most policies are getting stuck or not reaching the goal efficiently. The highest reward so far is 0.25, which suggests there's room for improvement. My task is to propose a new set of parameters that can either explore new paths (exploration) or tweak existing ones to improve rewards (exploitation).

Since the current best reward is significantly below 1.0, I should focus on exploration. This means suggesting policies that haven't been tried before and could potentially uncover better trajectories. From the most recent attempts, it looks like some policies are not moving towards the goal effectively or are getting stuck in loops.

I'll consider how each state can move closer to the goal while avoiding holes. For example, from state 0 (top-left), moving right or down is essential. However, due to slipperiness, choosing an action that has a high probability of moving towards the goal is crucial. Similarly, states near the edges might have limited movement options but must avoid falling into holes.

I'll analyze each state and decide which actions can lead closer to the goal while considering possible slips. For example, if in state 0, choosing action 1 (which moves right, down, or left) might not be optimal because it could move left back to the same state. Instead, action 2 or 3 might have a higher chance of moving towards the goal.

I'll map out possible paths and ensure that each step doesn't lead into a hole. For instance, states near the bottom-right (like 14 and 15) need policies that push directly to 15 without risk. Also, avoiding holes in states like 5, 6, etc., is critical.

After evaluating different possibilities, I'll construct a new set of parameters that ensure each state's action choice maximizes the probability of moving towards the goal while minimizing the chance of falling into holes. This might involve choosing actions that have a higher likelihood of progressing towards the target and avoiding risky moves.

Finally, I'll propose a new params array with values from 0 to 3 for each state, ensuring it hasn't been tried before and is distinct enough to provide new information about potential trajectories and rewards.
