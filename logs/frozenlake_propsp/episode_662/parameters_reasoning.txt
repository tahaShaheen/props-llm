You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out the best policy for the FrozenLake environment based on the given information. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right corner) with the highest possible reward of +1, while avoiding holes that end the episode immediately.

First, let's understand the environment:

- It's a 4x4 grid.
- There are holes in some states which I need to avoid. From the trajectories provided, it seems that certain actions lead to falling into these holes.
- The slippery nature means each action has three possible outcomes with equal probability.

Looking at the most recent policies and their rewards:

The best performing policy had a reward of 0.35. Most recent policies have lower rewards (0.00, 0.05, 0.10). This suggests that we're not very close to the optimal yet, so I should focus on exploration.

From the trajectories provided, some states are leading to holes when certain actions are taken. For example, in state 0 taking action 3 leads to (0,3), which might be a hole or leads to another problematic state. Similarly, other trajectories show that certain actions from specific states cause loops or lead towards holes.

To avoid falling into holes, the policy needs to select actions that keep the agent on safe paths leading towards the goal. Since each action has 3 possible outcomes, I need to choose actions that maximize the chance of moving towards state 15 without hitting a hole.

I should consider:

- States near the goal (like states 12, 13, 14, 15) should have policies that directly move towards 15.
- For other states, choosing actions that generally move right or down might be better since the goal is in the bottom-right corner.

Looking at state transitions:

- From state 0 (top-left), moving right (action 1) could take it to state 3 or maybe other positions. But considering the slippery nature, I need an action that has a higher chance of moving towards the goal without getting stuck in loops.

Wait, but since each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability, maybe I should pick actions that have at least one direction leading closer to the goal.

For example:

- State 0: If we choose action 1 (right), it might move to state 3. But from previous trajectories, some actions in state 0 lead to getting stuck or falling into holes. So perhaps choosing a different action is better.

Looking at the recent policies, when params[0] was set to 2 or 1, there were issues with falling into holes or not making progress. Maybe trying a new action for state 0 could help explore a different path.

Another approach: since all previous attempts have low rewards (below 0.35), I should focus on exploration by changing as many parameters as possible to gather more information about which actions lead to success or failure.

I'll try setting params in such a way that from each state, the agent has a higher chance of moving towards the goal while avoiding known problematic transitions.

Looking at state 15 (goal) - it's absorbing, so no action is needed there. For states near the goal:

- State 14: should move right to reach 15.
- State 13: moving down might take it to 14 or another direction, but since it's on the third row, moving down could be risky if there's a hole in state 17 (which doesn't exist). Wait, no, states are up to 15. So perhaps moving right is better.

But I need to look at each state individually.

Let me try to outline possible safe actions for each state:

- State 0: Try to move right or down.
- State 1: Moving right leads to state 3; maybe that's okay if it doesn't lead to a hole.
- State 2: Maybe moving down towards state 6.
- State 3: If state 3 is a hole, then the action from state 0 should avoid leading there. From the trajectories, taking action 1 in state 0 leads to state 4 sometimes.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think differently.

Since all previous policies have low rewards, maybe the optimal strategy is to try different actions for as many states as possible without repeating any previous params. This way, we can gather more data on which transitions are safe and which lead to holes.

So, I'll propose a new set of parameters where each state's action is different from the ones tried before, focusing on moving towards the goal while avoiding known problematic actions.
