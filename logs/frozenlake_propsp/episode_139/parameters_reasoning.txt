You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get the agent from any starting position to state 15 (the bottom-right corner) without falling into any holes. The environment is slippery, meaning each action has a 33% chance of going in three possible directions.

Looking at the provided data, all the top-performing policies so far have an average reward around 0.15 or lower. That's way below the target of 1.0, which means there's room for improvement. The trajectories show that many attempts are getting stuck in loops or falling into holes quickly, indicating that the current policies aren't avoiding dangers effectively.

I need to think about how to structure a policy that maximizes the chances of reaching state 15 without stepping on any holes. Since each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability, the agent needs a strategy that avoids high-risk areas and navigates towards the goal efficiently.

Let's consider the grid layout:
- State 0 is top-left (0,0), which is safe.
- States 3, 7, 11, and 15 are on the right edge. Reaching state 15 is the goal, so moving right when possible might be beneficial.
- The bottom-right corner (state 15) should have an action that doesn't move because staying there gives a reward without risk.

Holes are present in some states. From previous trajectories, it seems like certain states lead to holes if not navigated properly. For example, state 8 is the bottom-left of the third row, and moving down from there might be risky.

I should create a policy that moves towards the goal (state 15) as directly as possible while avoiding areas with holes. Let's outline a path:
- From state 0, move right or down to avoid getting stuck.
- States in the top row (0-3) can move right towards state 3 and then proceed downward.
- Middle rows should navigate towards the right side, moving up or down as needed to stay on safe paths.

For each state, I'll choose an action that has a higher probability of leading towards the goal without hitting holes. Since actions are probabilistic, the policy needs to cover multiple possible directions to ensure a path is available.

Let me map out some key states:
- State 0: Moving right (action 1) might be good as it can lead towards state 3.
- State 3: Moving down or right could help in progressing towards the goal.
- State 7: Needs to move down to get closer to state 11 and then 15.
- State 8: Should avoid moving left if there's a hole; perhaps moving up or right is safer.
- State 12: Should stay still (action 0 might not be ideal, but maybe action 3 can help in some way).

Wait, no. The action definitions are:
- Action 0: down, left, up
- Action 1: right, down, left
- Action 2: up, right, down
- Action 3: left, up, right

So each action gives three possible moves. To maximize progress towards the goal, I should choose actions that have a higher chance of moving towards the right or downward.

For example:
- In state 0 (top-left), choosing action 1 (right, down, left) might help move right to state 1.
- State 1 could choose action 3 to have a mix of up, right, and left, but maybe that's not ideal. Alternatively, action 1 again to keep moving right.

But looking at the previous attempts, many policies end up in loops or hit holes quickly, so perhaps I need a more deterministic approach with some stochastic elements to handle the slipperiness.

Wait, no. Since each action is probabilistic, the policy can't be fully deterministic but should guide the agent towards the goal with the highest probability.

I think setting up the policy such that in most states, the agent tries to move right or down when possible, avoiding left unless necessary. For example:
- States in the top row (0-3) should primarily move right.
- Middle rows should move towards the right and then down as needed.

But I'm not sure about this. Maybe it's better to have a mix of actions to cover multiple paths. Also, certain states might require specific actions to avoid holes.

Looking at the trajectories provided:
- The first example had params where most states moved action 1 or 3, leading to state 15 but with low rewards.
- Another trajectory went from (0,1) to (4,2), then to (8,2). It didn't reach the goal, so maybe those states need better actions.

Perhaps a better approach is to have a policy where each state's action increases the likelihood of moving towards the right or down. For instance:
- In state 0: action 1 (right, down, left) - might move right.
- State 1: action 3 (left, up, right) - can help explore different directions.
- But I'm not sure if this will lead to higher rewards.

Alternatively, maybe setting all states in the top row to move right and others to move towards the bottom-right could work. Let me try creating such a policy:

params = [
    1,  # state 0: action 1 (right)
    3,  # state 1: action 3 (left, up, right) - might help explore
    1,  # state 2: action 1
    3,  # state 3: action 3
    2,  # state 4: action 2 (up, right, down)
    0,  # state 5: action 0 (down, left, up) - might move down to reach the goal faster
    2,  # state 6: action 2
    3,  # state 7: action 3
    3,  # state 8: action 3
    1,  # state 9: action 1
    0,  # state 10: action 0 (down)
    2,  # state 11: action 2
    0,  # state 12: action 0
    3,  # state 13: action 3
    1,  # state 14: action 1
    3   # state 15: stay put (action 3 might have some movement)
]

Wait, but in this setup, state 15 is set to action 3, which allows moving left, up, or right. But since it's the goal, maybe staying still isn't necessary. Alternatively, setting it to action 0 (down) could prevent any movement from there.

Alternatively, set state 15's action to 0 so that if the agent is already at 15, it doesn't move anymore, ensuring it stays and gets the reward.

Hmm, but in this case, perhaps having a more systematic approach would help. Let me try another approach where each row moves towards the right:

params = [
    1,  # state 0: action 1 (right)
    1,  # state 1: action 1
    1,  # state 2: action 1
    1,  # state 3: action 1
    2,  # state 4: action 2 (up, right, down) - move right if possible
    2,  # state 5: action 2
    2,  # state 6: action 2
    2,  # state 7: action 2
    3,  # state 8: action 3 (left, up, right)
    3,  # state 9: action 3
    3,  # state 10: action 3
    3,  # state 11: action 3
    3,  # state 12: action 3
    3,  # state 13: action 3
    3,  # state 14: action 3
    0   # state 15: stay put (action 0)
]

This policy tries to move right as much as possible in the top row and middle rows. In the bottom rows, it uses action 3 to have a chance to move left, up, or right, which might help navigate towards the goal.

Alternatively, perhaps this is too rigid and doesn't account for hole positions. I need to ensure that actions chosen don't lead into holes when possible.

Wait, in the provided data, state 8 had some issues. So maybe adjusting action for state 8 to move up or right could help avoid falling into a hole below.

Let me adjust:

params = [
    1,   #0
    3,   #1
    1,   #2
    3,   #3
    1,   #4
    3,   #5
    1,   #6
    3,   #7
    2,   #8 (action 2: up, right, down) might help avoid moving into a hole below
    3,   #9
    1,   #10
    3,   #11
    3,   #12
    3,   #13
    3,   #14
    0    #15
]

This way, state 8 uses action 2, which can move up, right, or down. Moving up from 8 would take it to state 4, which is safer, while moving right might get closer to the goal.

I think this policy covers multiple paths and avoids some of the risky moves that led to holes in previous attempts.
