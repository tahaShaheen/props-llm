You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me start by understanding the problem thoroughly.

The environment is a 4x4 grid where each state can transition probabilistically due to the slippery nature. The agent's goal is to reach state 15 (bottom-right corner) without falling into any holes, which would end the episode with no reward. Each action has a 1/3 chance of moving in three directions, making it stochastic.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 elements, each corresponding to a state and indicating the action to take. The challenge is to find the set of actions that maximizes the expected reward, which should ideally be around 1.0 if the agent reaches the goal consistently.

Looking at the provided examples, it seems like most policies aren't performing well, with rewards averaging around 0.15 or lower. This suggests that the current strategies might not be effectively navigating towards the goal without falling into holes frequently.

I need to think about how to structure the policy to avoid holes while still progressing towards state 15. Maybe focusing on actions that generally move the agent closer to the goal, considering the possible stochastic movements.

For instance, in states where moving right or down would take the agent closer to the goal, setting those as the primary actions might help. However, due to the slippery nature, sometimes other directions could be taken with equal probability, so the policy must account for that.

I also notice that some previous policies have certain patterns, like alternating between 1 and 3 for even and odd states. Maybe that's an attempt to move in specific directions while considering the possible slips. But since they're not achieving high rewards, perhaps adjusting these actions could lead to better outcomes.

Another thought is to ensure that the policy doesn't lead the agent into known holes. For example, if certain states are holes or near them, the policy should avoid actions that might cause the agent to step on those holes.

Given that I'm supposed to maximize information gain and explore vs exploit based on current rewards, since the rewards are far below 1.0, I should act as an Explorer, trying out new configurations distinct from previous ones to gather more data.

So, for this iteration, I'll propose a policy where each state's action is chosen to generally move towards the goal, considering possible slips. For example, in the top-left corner (state 0), choosing actions that have a chance to move right or down, which would help progress towards the goal.

I'll try setting params[0] to 2, which corresponds to an action that can move up, right, or down. This gives a balanced approach from the start. Similarly, for other states, I'll choose actions that encourage movement towards the bottom-right while avoiding known holes based on previous trajectories.

After considering all this, I'll structure the params array accordingly, ensuring each state's action is selected to maximize the chance of reaching the goal without falling into holes.
