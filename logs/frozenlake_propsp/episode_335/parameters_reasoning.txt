You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15, which is the bottom right corner of the grid. All other states give a reward of 0, and stepping into the hole (which is probably state 12) in the last row makes me get killed.

The policy parameters are an array of 16 values representing the actions when in each state. Each action can be 0, 1, 2, or 3, corresponding to different directions. The challenge here is that without any prior knowledge of how rewards propagate through the states, it's hard to directly optimize these parameters.

The user wants me to choose values for params[0] to params[15], each from [0,1,2,3]. The aim is to find a policy that maximizes the expected reward. Since the optimal reward should be around None, meaning potentially high, but not guaranteed, I need to use some exploration and exploitation strategies.

Looking at the examples provided by the user, they have various configurations of parameters. For instance, some set params[0] = 2, which might mean taking action 2 (up). Others mix actions like 1, 3, etc. The goal is to find a balance where the policy explores possible paths without getting stuck in local optima too quickly.

I should consider using an algorithm that can handle exploration and exploitation, such as Q-learning or policy gradients. Since the problem seems complex, perhaps a policy gradient method would be more suitable because it can learn from both exploration and the immediate reward, which is crucial for this environment where stepping into the hole is lethal.

In policy gradient methods like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) or Stable Baseline 3's ddpg, the agent learns by adjusting its policy based on the expected rewards. The key here is to ensure that the agent explores different paths and doesn't converge too quickly unless it finds a better reward path.

I think I should start by randomly selecting some parameters values and see how the environment responds. Maybe even try setting params[0] = 1, which would mean taking action 3 (left) or 2 (up). But that's just an initial guess. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern in the examples provided that could hint at optimal values. For instance, some have params[0] = 2 and others mix around 2 and 3 for certain states. Maybe setting more of the higher-numbered actions in certain areas could help explore those areas without getting stuck.

I also need to consider how the reward function works. Since stepping into the hole gives a reward of -1 (assuming stepping into it ends the game), I have to avoid that while still trying to reach the goal. So, perhaps policies should balance between exploring other states and safely moving towards 15 by avoiding hard hits.

In terms of implementation, since this is an exploration task, I might need to use a function that allows for some random policy generation during training, ensuring it doesn't just follow a fixed policy too early. Maybe using a noise parameter or adjusting the learning rate to balance exploration and exploitation.

Overall, I think setting params[0] = 1, params[1] = 3, params[2] = 2, params[3] = 3, and others as needed might provide a good starting point that allows the agent enough time to explore different paths while still maintaining some exploration. But without testing, it's hard to say for sure. I should try a few parameter configurations and see which one yields the highest rewards.
