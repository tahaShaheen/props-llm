You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I need to help find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right corner) with a reward of +1, avoiding holes that end the episode.

First, understanding the problem: it's a 4x4 grid where each state can move in one of four directions, but because it's slippery, each action leads to three possible next states with equal probability. The policy is an array of 16 actions (0-3) for each state.

Looking at the provided data, the best reward so far is 0.25, which is much lower than the target of 1.0. This suggests that the current policies aren't effectively reaching the goal or are falling into holes too often.

The recent params tried include several variations where certain states might be leading to dead ends or holes. For example, some trajectories loop indefinitely or get stuck near the top-left area.

To improve, I should consider strategies that increase the chances of moving towards state 15 while avoiding holes. Since the environment is slippery, the policy needs to account for possible movements in multiple directions.

I think a greedy approach might help—designing policies where each state directs towards the goal as much as possible, considering the probabilities of movement. For example, from state 0 (top-left), moving right or down could be better since they bring closer to the goal.

Looking at previous successful trajectories, some managed to reach states like 8 (third row) but didn't proceed further. So maybe adjusting the policies for these intermediate states to push more towards the goal would help.

I also need to ensure that actions don't lead into holes. From the trajectories, it seems certain states are leading into holes when taking specific actions. Therefore, I should analyze which actions in each state are causing falls and adjust those.

Perhaps implementing a policy where, from each state, the action chosen maximizes the probability of moving towards the goal while minimizing the risk of falling into a hole. This might involve selecting actions that have higher chances of leading to safe, productive states.

I'll start by setting up the policies for key positions:

- State 0 (top-left): Choosing right or down.
- States near the top and left should push towards the bottom-right.
- Avoiding edges where holes are present; maybe choosing different directions when close to known hole areas.

Testing these ideas, I can propose a new set of params that guides the agent more effectively towards state 15 while avoiding risky moves. For instance, in states near the top and left, actions should move right or down, whereas in other states, actions might be adjusted based on proximity to the goal.
