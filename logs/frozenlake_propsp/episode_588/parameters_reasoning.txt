You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 588 out of 5000. OUTPUT ONLY THIS SINGLE LINE:

Do NOT output anything else. No explanation, no reasoning, nothing.



LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help optimize the FrozenLake environment's policy to reach the goal state 15 as efficiently as possible while avoiding holes. The environment is slippery, meaning each action taken has a probability of moving in one of three directions. The goal is to get an average reward close to 1.0, which would mean successfully reaching the goal most of the time.

Looking at the provided data, it seems that previous attempts have yielded rewards around 0.30, which is significantly below the target. This suggests that the current policies aren't effectively navigating towards the goal or are falling into holes too often. My task is to propose a new set of parameters for the policy that either explores new strategies (if we're in an exploration phase) or tweaks existing good ones slightly (if we're exploiting near-optimal solutions).

Given that the rewards are still low, I should focus on exploration. This means suggesting a parameter configuration that hasn't been tried before and could potentially lead to better outcomes by avoiding holes more effectively.

I'll consider how each state's action choice affects the path towards the goal. For example, starting from state 0 (top-left corner), choosing an action that moves right or down might be beneficial. However, due to the slippery nature, I need to choose actions that have a higher chance of moving towards the goal without risking falling into holes.

I'll examine each state and decide which action (0-3) would maximize the chances of moving closer to 15 while avoiding known holes. For instance, if a particular state is near a hole, the policy should avoid actions that might lead there. But since I don't have exact information on where the holes are, I'll assume that states with high failure rates in trajectories are likely near holes.

I'll structure the parameters to guide the agent towards moving right and down more often, as these directions generally lead towards the goal state 15. However, considering the slipperiness, each action should be chosen such that it maximizes the probability of moving in the desired direction without getting stuck in loops or near holes.

Finally, I'll construct a new parameter array where each index (state) is assigned an action from [0-3] based on this reasoning. The aim is to create a unique configuration that hasn't been tried before and has the potential to yield higher rewards.
