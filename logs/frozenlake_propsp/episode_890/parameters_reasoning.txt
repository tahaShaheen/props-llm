You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

Do NOT output anything else. No explanation, no reasoning, nothing.



LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with the highest possible reward of 1, while avoiding the holes that end the episode immediately.

First, I need to understand how the environment works. It's a 4x4 grid where each state corresponds to a specific cell (0-15). Actions can move in multiple directions because of the slippery nature, so each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability.

The policy is determined by an array of 16 numbers, each representing an action for each state. The actions are 0,1,2,3 corresponding to different movement sets. My task is to find the optimal set of these actions that maximizes the reward.

Looking at the problem, I see that the current top-performing policies have average rewards around 0.35-0.45, which is below the target of 1.0. This suggests we're not yet near optimality and need to explore more.

The recent trajectories show that some policies are getting stuck or falling into holes. For example, a policy leading to state 9 gets stuck moving around without reaching the goal. Another trajectory ends quickly by hitting a hole.

I should focus on modifying the policy to either avoid dangerous states or find a path towards the goal. Since the environment is slippery, choosing actions that have a higher chance of moving towards the goal while minimizing risks of falling into holes is crucial.

One approach could be to adjust the policies in critical areas. For instance, state 8 and 9 are on the third row; ensuring they move towards state 12 (which is just above 15) might help progress closer to the goal. Similarly, states near the edges or holes should have cautious policies.

Looking at the recent params, some actions in dangerous areas may not be optimal. I need to change these actions slightly to explore new paths without repeating previous attempts. This could involve selecting different actions for a few key states to see if they lead to better outcomes.

Considering all this, I'll propose a new set of parameters that shifts certain states towards more goal-oriented movements while avoiding known risky areas.
