You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward by reaching state 15, avoiding the holes. Let me think through how to approach this.

First, understanding the setup: It's a 4x4 grid with slippery movements. Each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability. Holes are present, and stepping on them ends the episode with zero reward. The policy is defined by an array of 16 actions (each state maps to one of four actions).

From the problem statement, the global optimal reward should be around 1.0, meaning the agent successfully reaches the goal in most episodes. However, the current best seems lower, so there's room for improvement.

Looking at the top-performing params provided, they have average rewards around 0.2 to 0.3. That's significantly below 1.0, indicating that the policies aren't reaching the goal often enough. So, I need to propose a policy that increases this success rate.

The recent attempts show even lower or zero rewards, which suggests that many policies are failing early on, perhaps falling into holes or getting stuck in loops. The trajectories provided also indicate issues like getting stuck moving around without progressing towards the goal.

Given that we're at iteration 483 and have up to 5000 iterations, it's still early in the process. But I need to propose a new policy that explores different actions, especially focusing on states near the goal or those prone to falling into holes.

One approach is to design a policy that encourages movement towards the right and down directions since state 15 is at the bottom-right corner. However, due to the slippery nature, the agent might drift in unintended ways, so the policy must account for possible deviations.

I should consider setting actions for each state that have a higher chance of moving closer to the goal while minimizing the risk of falling into holes. For example:

- In states near the bottom or right edges, prefer down or right actions where possible.
- Avoid actions that lead towards known hole positions when possible.
- Ensure that from any state, there's a path towards the goal without crossing holes.

But since I can't remember previous attempts, each suggestion must be unique and not repeat previous policies. So I need to generate a new set of params that hasn't been tried yet.

Looking at the most recent five params, they all have low rewards, so perhaps tweaking certain states could help. For instance, maybe changing the action for state 0 from what was previously used (like in the top-left corner) to encourage moving right or down more often.

Alternatively, perhaps a greedy approach where each state's action is chosen to maximize the immediate chance of getting closer to the goal, considering the slippery nature.

I think I need to propose a policy that, for each state, selects an action that has the highest probability of eventually leading towards the goal without stepping into holes. For example:

- States in the top row (0-3) should move right or down.
- Middle states should prefer moving towards the bottom-right direction.

But since movement is probabilistic, it's tricky to predict exact paths. Maybe setting each state to choose an action that has the highest potential to reach the goal when considering possible slips.

I'll draft a new params array based on this logic:

params[0]: 1 (right or down? Maybe right as initial step)
params[1]: 2 (down, but considering movement options)
Wait, I need to map each state's action correctly. Let me list the states and their possible actions.

Alternatively, maybe setting all states to prefer moving towards the goal direction. For example:

- States in row 0: move right or down.
- States in row 1: move down or right if possible.
- Similarly for other rows.

But I need to map this into action choices (0-3). Each action corresponds to a set of possible moves, so choosing an action that includes the desired direction.

For example:
- Action 0 allows moving down, left, up. So in states where moving down is beneficial, choose action 0.
- Action 1 allows right, down, left. Good for moving towards the right or down.
- Similarly for others.

I think a possible optimal policy would have each state choose actions that maximize the chance of moving towards the goal while avoiding holes.

After considering all this, I'll propose a new params array, ensuring it's unique and hasn't been tried before in the given examples.
