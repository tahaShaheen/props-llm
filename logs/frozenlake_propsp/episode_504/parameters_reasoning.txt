You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right corner) and get a reward of +1. All other states give 0 rewards, but there are holes that end the episode if stepped on.

First, I need to understand how the slippery actions work. Each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability. For example, choosing action 0 can result in moving down, left, or up. This makes planning a bit tricky because each move is probabilistic.

Looking at the state representation: states 0-3 are top row (left to right), 4-7 second row, 8-11 third, and 12-15 bottom row. So, for example, state 15 is the goal.

From the history provided, I see that previous policies have had low rewards, around 0.20 or even 0.05. The best so far is 0.30, which isn't very high, suggesting we're not close to the optimal policy yet.

The user mentioned that the global optimal reward should be around 1.0, so my current policies aren't performing well enough. I need to find a way to maximize the probability of reaching state 15 without falling into any holes.

Looking at the trajectories, some paths are getting stuck or falling into loops. For example, one trajectory went (0,3) and then kept looping around without reaching the goal. Another went from (0,1) to (4,2) and then to (8,2), which might be leading towards the goal but didn't complete it.

I need to think about how each state's action can guide the agent towards 15 while avoiding holes. Since the environment is slippery, actions are probabilistic, so the policy needs to choose actions that have a high chance of moving towards the goal without risk of falling into holes.

Let me consider each state and figure out the best possible action:

- State 0 (top-left corner): Possible moves from action 0: down, left, up. But since it's at the top, moving up is impossible. So action 0 would have a 1/2 chance of going down or left. Action 1: right, down, left. Right might lead towards state 3, but if there's a hole in that direction, I need to avoid it. Alternatively, action 2 and 3 are similar.

Wait, maybe I should map the transitions for each state and action. For example:

For state 0:
- Action 0: down (state 4), left (invalid? Since it's already at column 0), or up (invalid). So actually, from state 0, action 0 can only go to state 4 (down) because left is impossible and up is invalid. Wait no, the grid is 4x4, so moving left from state 0 would wrap around? Or does it stay in place? I think in standard FrozenLake, movement beyond boundaries stays in place. But according to the problem description, when taking an action, you choose among three directions with equal probability.

Wait, no—each action leads to three possible moves, but if moving left from state 0 would go out of bounds, does it stay? Or is it considered a hole? The problem statement doesn't specify, so I need to assume that any move off the grid remains in the same state. Alternatively, perhaps movement beyond boundaries isn't allowed, and those actions are just not taken.

This is a bit ambiguous. But given that all states except 15 can be holes or passable, I should focus on ensuring that from each state, the chosen action has a path towards 15 without leading into known holes.

Looking at the top-performing params provided earlier:

One of them had f(params) = 0.30 with a trajectory going (0,1) -> (4,2) -> (8,2). So from state 0, taking action 1 leads to state 4, then action 2 is taken which might go towards state 7 or something.

Wait, perhaps it's better to create a map of safe paths. The key is to avoid the holes and find a path that maximizes the chance of reaching 15.

Given that I don't have information on where the holes are, except from previous trajectories, I can infer which states might be dangerous. For example, in one trajectory, taking action 0 from state 5 leads to (4,2) then (8,2), but another from state 0 with action 3 leads to a hole.

Wait, perhaps the best approach is to have policies that guide towards the right and down as much as possible, since those directions are more likely to lead towards the goal at state 15.

So for each state, I should choose actions that have a higher probability of moving towards the right or down. For example:

- In state 0 (top-left), action 1 (right) is better than others because it leads towards state 3.
- In state 1, action 3 might help in moving to state 4 or 5, etc.

But I'm not sure about the exact transitions without knowing where the holes are. So perhaps a more cautious approach is needed.

Wait, looking at the recent params:

One recent param had all actions set to 3 except some states. That didn't perform well, but maybe adjusting specific actions could help.

Alternatively, since the previous best was around 0.30, I need to explore other policies that can get higher rewards.

Perhaps a greedy approach towards the goal is better. For example:

- From state 12 (bottom-left), the only way up is to move right or down (but moving down would stay in place if at the bottom). So action 1 from state 12 could lead to state 13, which is closer to 15.

Wait, let's consider each state and see what actions can lead towards the goal:

- State 0: should move right or down. Action 1 (right) leads to state 1; action 0 (down) leads to state 4.

But I don't know which is safer. Maybe choosing action 1 first.

Similarly, for state 1, moving right (action 3?) could lead towards higher states.

Wait, this is getting complicated without knowing the exact hole positions. Alternatively, perhaps a policy that always tries to move right or down when possible would be better.

Another approach: since the environment is slippery and each action has three possible moves, I can model it as a Markov Decision Process with transitions having probabilities.

But without knowing where the holes are, it's hard to design an exact policy. So perhaps focusing on states near the goal and working backwards could help.

For example:

- State 15: terminal (goal).
- States adjacent to 15: state 14 (left), state 11 (up), etc.

From state 14, moving right leads to 15. So if action from state 14 is set to move right (which would be part of the slippery actions).

But since each action has three possible moves, setting the policy in a way that increases the probability of moving towards 15.

This requires creating a map where each state's action maximizes the chance of moving closer to 15 without stepping into holes.

However, without knowing which states are holes, it's challenging. Therefore, perhaps the best strategy is to propose a new policy that differs significantly from previous ones to explore new trajectories and gather more data about the environment.

Looking back at the history, most recent params tried were setting many actions to 3, but they didn't perform well. So maybe trying a different approach.

Perhaps setting action 2 for all states except when moving towards the goal could help. Or varying the actions based on the state's position.

Wait, another idea: in standard FrozenLake, the optimal policy tends to move right and down as much as possible because that leads directly to the goal without loops. So perhaps applying a similar strategy here would be beneficial.

For example:

- From even rows, prefer moving right.
- From odd rows, prefer moving down.

But I'm not sure how the slippery actions affect this. Since each action has three possible moves, choosing an action that maximizes the chance of moving towards the goal is key.

Alternatively, maybe a policy where from each state, the agent tries to move in a direction that increases its row or column index (i.e., towards the bottom-right).

Given all these considerations, perhaps proposing a new set of params that systematically moves the agent right and down would be effective. For example:

- From states in even columns, choose actions that tend to move right.
- From states in higher rows, choose actions that tend to move down.

But without knowing the exact hole positions, this is speculative.

Another angle: look at the trajectories provided. For instance, one trajectory went (0,1) -> (4,2) -> (8,2). So from state 0 taking action 1 led to state 4, which took action 2 leading to state 8 or something else. Maybe that's a path towards the goal.

But another trajectory ended quickly due to falling into a hole, indicating certain actions from specific states are risky.

Given that, perhaps the best approach is to propose a new set of params that systematically guides towards the goal while avoiding high-risk moves. For example:

- From state 0: action 1 (right) to move towards state 3.
- From state 1: action 3 (which includes right as one of the options).
- Continue this pattern, ensuring each state's action has a higher probability of moving towards the goal.

Alternatively, perhaps setting all actions to 2 or 3, which include more right and up/down movements.

But without knowing where the holes are, it's hard to make precise choices. Therefore, I'll propose a new set of params that tries to move towards the goal in as direct a path as possible, varying from previous attempts.

The reasoning is to adjust certain actions from the previous best policy to explore new trajectories while maintaining a path towards the goal. For example, changing some actions from 0 or 2 to 3 might help avoid holes and increase the chance of reaching state 15.
