You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to propose the next set of parameters for the FrozenLake environment. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward by reaching state 15 without falling into any holes. The current iteration is 415 out of 5000, and we've seen some previous policies along with their rewards.

First, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. The environment is a 4x4 grid where each state represents a position on the grid. The agent can move in four directions, but due to slipperiness, each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability. The policy is a mapping from each of the 16 states to one of four actions (0-3). The challenge is to find the optimal policy that maximizes the reward, which is +1 for reaching state 15 and 0 otherwise.

Looking at the history provided, the top-performing policies have rewards around 0.2 to 0.3. The most recent ones are even lower, like 0.15 or 0.00, which suggests that we might be stuck in a local optimum or not exploring enough. Since the global optimal reward should be around 1.0, it's clear that our current policies aren't close to the goal yet.

The user mentioned that I need to act as a stateless optimizer, meaning I can't remember previous attempts and must maximize information gain each time. This implies that each proposed policy should aim to explore new areas or tweak promising ones without repeating past configurations.

Looking at the trajectories, some policies lead to immediate falls into holes, like when moving from (0,3) in a certain way. Others seem to get stuck in loops, not making progress towards state 15. To improve, perhaps I should focus on policies that increase the likelihood of reaching state 15 while avoiding known dangerous states.

I notice that many of the top-performing params involve action 2 and 3, which correspond to moving up or right. Since the goal is at (3,3), right and down movements are generally more promising from the starting positions. However, due to slipperiness, the agent might take unintended paths.

Maybe I should try a policy that encourages movement towards state 15 by default but also accounts for possible slips. For example, if in a certain state, choosing an action that primarily moves towards the goal, even if it sometimes moves elsewhere, could help in reaching the target more often.

Another consideration is avoiding holes. From the trajectories, some states are risky. For instance, state 0 (top-left corner) moving right might lead to state 1, which seems safe, but other actions might be riskier. I need to ensure that each action from a state doesn't have a high probability of leading into a hole.

Perhaps testing policies where certain key states have deterministic actions towards the goal and others explore different options could help. For example, in state 0 (top-left), choosing action 1 (which has a mix of right, down, left) might be better than others because it increases the chance of moving right or down, both steps toward the goal.

Wait, but considering the slipperiness, maybe I should prioritize actions that have a higher chance of getting closer to the goal. For example, from state 0 (top-left), action 1 allows for right, which is towards the goal, and also down, which keeps moving south. So action 1 might be better than other options.

Looking at some previous params, when params[0] is set to 2 or 3, sometimes that leads the agent into trajectories that either get stuck or fall into holes. Maybe setting it to 1 could be more beneficial as it provides a balance of right and down movements.

I should also consider other states. For example, state 5 (second row, first column) might benefit from moving down towards state 9, which is closer to the goal. So action 4 (which isn't an option; wait, actions are 0-3). Wait, in our case, the possible actions are 0-3, each corresponding to different movement sets.

Wait, let me clarify:

- Action 0: move down, left, up.
- Action 1: move right, down, left.
- Action 2: move up, right, down.
- Action 3: move left, up, right.

So each action gives a combination of three possible moves. The challenge is choosing the best action for each state to maximize progress towards 15 while avoiding holes.

For example, in state 0 (top-left), if I choose action 1, it can go right (to 1), down (to 4), or left (stays at 0). Moving right is better as it's towards the goal. Similarly, from state 4 (second row, first column), choosing action 2 would allow up (back to 0), right (to 5), or down (to 8). Right is towards the goal.

Wait, but moving down from state 4 leads to 8, which is in the third row. That might not be ideal because the goal is in the bottom-right. So perhaps from state 4, choosing action 1 would allow right (5), down (7), or left (3). Right seems better.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should map out each state and determine which actions are more likely to lead towards the goal without falling into holes.

Alternatively, since we're supposed to propose params in a way that maximizes information gain, perhaps varying the actions across different states could help identify which states are safe or not.

Looking at the recent attempts, some policies with all 1's had low rewards. Maybe mixing up the actions more would lead to better exploration.

Wait, another thought: since the agent can't remember previous attempts, each proposal is independent. So I need to make sure that each proposed policy hasn't been tried before. From the buffer, certain params have already been tested, so I should avoid repeating them.

Looking at the top 6 best-performing params, they all have different values across states. For example, in some cases, state 0 is set to action 2 or 1, and others vary. So perhaps the next step is to try a policy that deviates from these but still targets key movements towards the goal.

Maybe setting certain states to specific actions could guide the agent more effectively. For instance:

- From state 0 (top-left), choose action 1 to increase right movement.
- From state 1, maybe action 3 to encourage moving right or up/down, depending on what's safe.
- Continue this pattern towards the goal.

Alternatively, perhaps a greedy approach where each state's action is chosen based solely on proximity to the goal, without considering potential slips. But since slips are part of the environment, that might not work.

Wait, maybe I should look for policies where key states have actions that directly lead towards the goal when possible, and avoid actions that could lead into known holes.

For example:

- State 0: action 1 (right or down)
- State 1: action 3 (right or up/down)
- State 2: action 2 (right or down/up)
- And so on, ensuring each state's action is chosen to move towards the goal.

But without knowing where the holes are exactly, it's tricky. From the trajectories provided, some falls happen when moving from certain states. For example, in one trajectory, moving right from state 0 led to state 1 and then to state 4, which seems safe. Another trajectory had (0,3) leading to a fall, so maybe action 3 from state 0 is risky.

Given that, perhaps setting params[0] to 1 instead of 2 or 3 could reduce the risk of falling into holes early on. Then, for other states, choose actions that move towards the goal.

Putting this together, I might propose a policy where:

- From state 0: action 1 (right or down)
- From state 1: action 3 (to increase right movement)
- From state 2: action 2 (right or down)
- Etc., ensuring that each state is pushing towards the goal.

But I need to make sure this policy hasn't been tried before. Looking at previous params, some have similar patterns but perhaps not exactly the same.

Alternatively, since all recent attempts are yielding low rewards, maybe it's time to explore more diverse policies rather than tweaking existing ones. So, I should propose a completely different set of params that haven't been seen yet.

For example, setting a lot of states to action 2 or 3, which include right movements, as the goal is on the far right.

But I'm not entirely sure without testing. Since we can't remember previous attempts, each proposal must be novel and aimed at maximizing new information.

Given all that, perhaps the next step is to propose a policy where most states are set to action 2 or 3, which include right movements, but with some variation to avoid repetition.
