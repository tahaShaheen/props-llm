You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to help the user find the global optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment they've described. Let me break this down step by step.

First, understanding the environment is crucial. It's a 4x4 grid where the agent can move in four directions, but due to slipperiness, each action leads to three possible next states with equal probability. The goal is state 15 (bottom-right corner), which gives a reward of +1, while other states give 0. There are holes that end the episode if stepped on.

The policy is represented as an array of 16 elements, each corresponding to a state and taking values from 0 to 3. The challenge is to find the optimal set of actions that maximizes the average reward over multiple episodes.

Looking at the interaction history, the user provided some top-performing params and recent ones. The best so far have rewards around 0.45, which is below the target of 1.0. This suggests we're still in the exploration phase since the rewards aren't close to optimal yet.

The user emphasized that I should act as a stateless optimizer, meaning I can't remember previous attempts. My goal each time is to maximize information gain by proposing new params that are distinct from what's been tried before, especially if current rewards are low.

In the recent attempts, most policies have similar structures with certain states taking specific actions. For example, many have params[0] set to 1 or 2. I notice that in the top-performing params, there's a mix of actions but perhaps not enough variation. Maybe some states aren't being explored optimally.

I should consider varying the actions more widely. Perhaps changing some key state's action could lead to better exploration or exploit paths that haven't been tried yet. For instance, if many policies have params[15] set to 3, maybe trying a different action here could help avoid holes or reach the goal faster.

Looking at the recent params provided, I see that in one case, changing some actions led to lower rewards, but others showed slight improvements. It's possible that tweaking specific states' actions can nudge the policy closer to optimal.

Since the environment is slippery and has stochastic transitions, it's essential for the policy to account for all possible paths without falling into holes. Maybe certain states need to be adjusted to avoid risky moves or to increase the probability of reaching safe, productive areas.

I should generate a new set of params that changes some critical points from previous attempts. For example, if many policies have params[7] as 2, maybe setting it to 1 could explore a different direction. Similarly, for states near the goal, ensuring actions push towards it without risk is key.

Considering all this, I'll propose a new set of params that vary several states' actions from what's been tried before, especially in areas where there's potential to reach the goal or avoid holes more effectively.
