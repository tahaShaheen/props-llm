You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

Do NOT output anything else. No explanation, no reasoning, nothing.



LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get the agent to state 15 with the highest possible reward, which should be around 1.0 if everything goes right. But there are holes that can end the episode, so I need to make sure the policy avoids them.

Looking at the previous examples and trajectories provided, it seems like most policies aren't reaching the goal consistently yet. The best performing one had a reward of 0.30, which is significantly below 1.0. That suggests that while some progress has been made, there's still room for improvement.

I notice that in the top-performing params, the agent often takes action 2 or 3 from state 0, leading it towards the right or down directions. However, since the environment is slippery, these actions can result in moving in different directions with equal probability. Maybe adjusting these initial moves could help the agent get closer to the goal without falling into holes.

In the recent attempts, some policies resulted in trajectories that either looped indefinitely or fell into holes quickly. For example, one trajectory had the agent taking action 3 from state 0, which led it to move right with a third chance but then got stuck in a cycle. Another recent attempt led to an immediate fall into a hole when taking action 3 again.

So, I think I need to try modifying the initial states to encourage more direct progress towards state 15. Maybe from state 0 (top-left), choosing actions that have a higher chance of moving right or down would be beneficial. But since the environment is slippery, each action has three possible outcomes, so the policy needs to account for that uncertainty.

I'll consider setting params[0] to 2 (which allows moving up, right, or down) to give it a better chance of moving towards state 1 or state 4. From there, I need to ensure that subsequent states also have actions that guide it closer to the goal without stepping into holes.

Looking at other states, perhaps adjusting params[8] and params[9] could help as these are in the third row, closer to the bottom-right corner. Maybe setting these to actions that prioritize moving right or down would push the agent towards state 15 more effectively.

I also need to make sure that each action chosen doesn't lead the agent into a hole based on previous trajectories. For example, certain states might have high risks of falling into holes if specific actions are taken, so I'll need to avoid those.

After considering all these factors, I think adjusting several key states' actions could help improve the reward. Let me structure the params array accordingly, ensuring each state's action is chosen to maximize the chance of reaching the goal without falling into holes.
