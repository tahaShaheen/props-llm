You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to solve this FrozenLake problem where the goal is to find the optimal policy that maximizes the reward. The environment is a 4x4 grid with slippery movements and holes which end the episode if stepped on.

First, I need to understand how the environment works. Each state has four possible actions (left, down, right, up), but due to slipperiness, each action leads to three directions with equal probability. The goal is state 15 (bottom-right corner) giving a reward of +1, while other states give 0. Holes are present which I need to avoid.

The policy is defined by an array params[0..15], where each element represents the action taken in that state. My task is to find the optimal set of actions for each state that maximizes the average reward over 20 episodes.

Looking at the previous top and recent params, most have f(params) around 0.35-0.45. The goal is to reach around 1.0, so I need to improve upon these.

I notice that in the best-performing params, states often take action 1 or 3, which might be helping to navigate towards the goal while avoiding holes. For example, state 0 (top-left) taking action 1 could help move right, but considering slipperiness, it might end up moving down, left, or staying in place.

Given that the agent can't remember previous attempts, I need to propose a new set of params that explore new possibilities without repeating previous ones. Since rewards are still below the target, I should focus on exploring rather than optimizing existing near-optimal policies.

I'll try modifying some states' actions to see if they lead to better outcomes. For instance, in state 15, it's already the goal, so no action is needed, but since the params need to be defined, maybe setting it to stay could help, though it's a terminal state. Wait, actually, once you reach state 15, the episode ends regardless of actions.

I should ensure that paths leading to the goal are as direct as possible and avoid any known holes. Perhaps adjusting states near the top-left (0-3) to move more towards right or down could help in navigating towards the goal without falling into holes.

Let me think about each state:

- State 0 (top-left): Possible actions should try to get closer to the goal. Maybe action 1 (right, but with possible drifts). Previously, params[0] was 1, so perhaps changing it might help.

Wait, no, since in the previous best, state 0 takes action 1. Maybe that's not the most efficient. Alternatively, taking action 3 (up) but considering movement probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps taking action 2 to move up or right. But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to map out possible movements for each state.

For example, in state 0 (row 0, column 0), moving down would take it to row1, column0 (state4). Moving right would go to state1. So, if the agent is in state0 and takes action1 (which can lead to move right, down, or left), but left from state0 is invalid? Or does it stay in place?

Wait, no, in the problem statement, when you take an action, you have a 33% chance of each possible direction. So for action0, from state0, moving down (to state4), left (state remains 0?), or up (invalid, perhaps stays? Or maybe wraps around, but I think it's invalid and the position doesn't change). Wait, no, in FrozenLake, if you try to move out of bounds, you stay put. So from state0, moving left would keep it in state0.

Hmm, that complicates things because it can get stuck oscillating between states if not careful.

To avoid holes, perhaps I need to find paths that minimize the chance of stepping into them. For example, certain states are known to be near holes and should take actions that lead away from those.

I think a better approach is to focus on states near the goal and work backwards, ensuring that each state's action leads towards the goal without hitting any holes.

Given that I don't have information about which specific states are holes (since it wasn't provided), but in standard FrozenLake, there are holes in some of the middle states. So perhaps I should assume certain states are dangerous and adjust actions accordingly.

Let me try to propose a new set of params. Maybe changing some of the earlier states' actions from 1 or 3 to other values to see if that helps.

For instance, setting state0's action to 2 (right, up, down). That might give more chances to move right towards the goal. Or perhaps 3 (left, up, right), which could help in moving around possible holes.

But without knowing where the holes are exactly, it's tricky. Alternatively, maybe I should look at the trajectories provided and see if certain paths lead to failures due to falling into holes.

Looking at the most recent params:

params[0]:3;... leads to (0,2) which might be a problem because moving down from state0 with action3 could go to state4 or stay or move up. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe setting state8 (top of third row, column 0) to take action 3 (left, up, right). That way, it can try to move right towards the goal while avoiding possible holes below.

I'm not entirely sure, but given that I need to propose a new set, perhaps I'll modify a few states to different actions to explore new trajectories. For example:

- Change state0's action from 1 to 2.
- Change state4's action from 0 to 3.
- Maybe adjust other states near the bottom-right to ensure they move towards the goal.

But without knowing which states are holes, it's hard to make precise changes. So perhaps I'll try a different approach by slightly varying some of the previous best params to see if that leads to better rewards.

I think for now, I'll propose a new set where some key states have their actions changed to explore more towards the goal and avoid potential traps.
