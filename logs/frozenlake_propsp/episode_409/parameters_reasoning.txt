You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get the agent from any starting position to state 15 with the highest possible reward of +1, while avoiding holes that end the episode immediately.

First, I need to understand how the slippery nature of the environment affects movement. Each action taken by the agent doesn't directly lead to the desired direction but instead has a 33% chance to go in one of three directions (left, right, up, down). So, for example, if the agent takes action 0, it can move down, left, or up with equal probability.

Looking at the provided top params and their rewards, all have f(params) below 0.3, which is far from the optimal 1.0. This suggests that the current policies aren't very effective in reaching the goal consistently.

The recent two parameters both resulted in zero reward, which likely means they fell into holes or got stuck in loops without reaching state 15. So, I need to propose a new set of params that explore different paths and avoid these pitfalls.

Since we're supposed to maximize information gain by exploring new configurations, I should choose a policy that hasn't been tried before. Looking at the top params, there's a pattern where certain states are mapped to specific actions. For example, in state 0 (top-left), action 2 is common, which might mean moving up or right.

I want to try varying some of these mappings to see if it leads to better exploration. Maybe changing the action for state 15 to something that ensures reaching the goal without falling into holes. Also, ensuring that each step doesn't lead towards a hole by avoiding actions that could drop the agent into a hole state with high probability.

Let me think about how to structure this. For example, maybe certain states should prioritize moving towards the right or down more, depending on their position. Alternatively, setting some states to stay still (but wait, in the given problem, action 0 doesn't include staying; all actions have movement options).

Wait, actually, each action leads to a move but with probability. So, maybe for states near the goal, it's better to take actions that can get closer regardless of the slipperiness.

Perhaps I should design the policy so that when the agent is in a position where any action has a chance to reach the goal or avoid holes, the params are set accordingly.

Another thought: The recent attempts had very low rewards, so maybe introducing more exploration by varying actions could help find better paths. For instance, changing some of the early states' actions from moving right (action 1) to something else might lead to new trajectories.

I need to ensure that the policy doesn't repeat any previous configurations and is as distinct as possible to gather new information about which paths are successful or not.

Maybe I can set certain states near the goal to take specific actions that, despite the slippage, have a higher chance of reaching the goal. For example, state 12 (which is in row 3, column 0) should perhaps move right more often since it's closer to state 15.

But wait, each action for state i has three possible directions with equal probability. So, I can't directly control the direction but choose which set of possible movements the agent will take when in that state.

I think a good approach is to make sure that as the agent moves towards the right and down, it avoids the holes. For example, states near the bottom-right (states 12-15) should prioritize moving right or down to reach the goal quickly.

Also, looking at the recent trajectories, some agents got stuck in loops because they kept returning to the same state without making progress. So, perhaps adjusting the policy to avoid cycles by choosing actions that push the agent forward towards the goal even when there's slippage.

Given all this, I'll try to create a new params array where each state is assigned an action that has a higher chance of moving towards the goal or avoiding known holes based on previous trajectories. For example, in states near the top-left, perhaps moving right and down more often could help.

Let me draft a possible configuration:

- For state 0 (top-left), maybe taking action 1 to move right, down, or left. But since the goal is to the right and bottom, moving right might be better.
- Similarly, for other states in the top row, actions that push towards the right or down.

But I need to make sure each params[i] is unique from previous ones to maximize exploration.

Wait, looking at the recent params, some had all even indices set to 2 and others varied. To avoid repetition, perhaps assign different values where possible.

I think a good approach is to alternate actions in such a way that it explores various paths without repeating previous attempts. Maybe setting each state's action to cycle through the available options more evenly.

After considering all this, I'll propose a new set of params that varies from the top-performing ones and recent attempts, ensuring each state has an action that might lead to better exploration towards the goal while avoiding holes.
