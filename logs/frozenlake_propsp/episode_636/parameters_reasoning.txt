You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with the highest possible reward. Since the environment is slippery and there are holes, I need to make sure that the agent avoids them as much as possible.

Looking at the previous trajectories provided, it seems like many policies aren't reaching the goal efficiently or are falling into holes. For example, some trajectories get stuck in loops or end up in states with no progress towards 15. This suggests that the current policies might not be effectively navigating around the holes or don't have a clear path to the goal.

I notice that the best performing policy so far has an average reward of 0.30. That's not too bad, but it's still below the target of 1.0. So, I need to think about how to improve this.

Since the environment is slippery, each action taken by the agent leads to a random movement in three possible directions. Therefore, the policy needs to account for these probabilities and choose actions that maximize the chance of reaching the goal while minimizing the risk of falling into holes.

One approach could be to have the agent try to move towards the right or down as much as possible since those movements would generally lead it closer to state 15. However, due to the slipperiness, I need to ensure that each action choice doesn't lead the agent into a hole with high probability.

Looking at the current top policies, they seem to have some success in moving towards the goal but might not be avoiding holes effectively. For example, in the first top policy, after state 0 taking action 1 (which could move right, down, or left), it ends up moving down to state 4, then again moves down to 8, and so on. But this doesn't necessarily reach the goal quickly.

I think a better strategy would be to have the agent prioritize actions that increase its chances of moving towards the goal while avoiding known holes. This might involve mapping out which states are safe and which aren't, but without knowing the exact hole locations, it's tricky.

Given that I can't remember previous attempts, I need to maximize information gain each time. So, perhaps choosing a policy that tries different actions in various states to explore new trajectories is necessary. However, since we're already at iteration 636 and have some data, maybe it's time to start optimizing around the best-performing policies.

Looking at the most recent policies, many of them have average rewards close to zero, which indicates they aren't performing well. This suggests that I should focus on the top-performing ones and tweak their parameters slightly to see if we can get closer to 1.0.

For instance, in the first top policy, changing some actions from one direction to another might help avoid holes or reach the goal more directly. Maybe increasing the rightward movements or adjusting the probabilities based on slipperiness could make a difference.

I should also consider that state 15 is the bottom-right corner, so moving right and down are generally good directions. But due to the slippery nature, I need to ensure that each action choice doesn't often lead into a hole. Perhaps focusing on states closer to the goal and ensuring their actions guide towards it more effectively would help.

Another thought: since the agent's actions are probabilistic, maybe setting up the policy so that each state has a mix of actions that cover multiple possible safe paths could increase the chances of reaching the goal without falling into holes. This might involve some trial and error, but with 5000 iterations, it's manageable.

In summary, I think the next step is to take one of the top-performing policies and adjust specific parameters in states near the goal or along common trajectories to see if we can improve the reward towards 1.0.
