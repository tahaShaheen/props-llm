You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. It's a 4x4 grid where the goal is state 15, and there are holes that end the episode if you land on them. The environment is slippery, meaning each action has a 33% chance of moving in three possible directions. The policy is an array of 16 numbers, each representing the action to take from states 0 to 15.

Looking at the problem, I need to propose a new set of params that hasn't been tried before and could help improve the reward towards the global optimal of around 1.0. Since the current best rewards are still quite low (around 0.3), we're in the exploration phase where the goal is to gather more information rather than optimize.

I should consider strategies that increase the chances of reaching state 15 while avoiding holes. From the trajectories provided, it seems like some policies tend to get stuck or fall into holes. So, I need a policy that navigates towards the goal without stepping on any holes.

Let me map out the grid and identify potential holes. The problem mentions holes but doesn't specify their locations, so I'll assume based on standard FrozenLake setups. Typically, in 4x4, states like 5, 7, 11 are holes. So, I should ensure that when the agent is near these states, it takes actions that avoid them.

Looking at the top-performing params, many of them have a mix of actions, but they might not be effectively guiding towards the goal. I need to think about how each state can move closer to 15.

For example:
- State 0 (top-left) should probably try moving right or down.
- States along the edges should avoid falling into holes by choosing safe directions.
- Middle states should have actions that lead towards the bottom-right.

I'll create a policy where from each state, the agent takes an action that has the highest probability of moving it closer to 15 without hitting a hole. Since actions are probabilistic, I need to choose actions that maximize the chance of moving right or down as much as possible.

Let me assign actions step by step:
- State 0 (0,0): Moving right (action 1) might take it to state 1, but considering slipperiness, it could go down to 4. Maybe action 2 (up) isn't useful here since up is out of bounds. So, perhaps moving right or down.
Wait, no—action 0 for state 0: [down, left, up]. Down would take it to 4. Left is invalid, so maybe down is safer.

But I'm not sure; perhaps a better approach is to look at existing policies and see what's missing. The top-performing params often have action 2 or 3 in certain states. Maybe adjusting some actions from 0 to 1 could help.

Wait, the environment is slippery, so each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability. So, for example, if a state is on the edge, taking an action that tries to move towards the goal but also has safe fallbacks.

I think I need to create a policy where from each state, the agent's chosen action increases the likelihood of moving towards 15 without hitting holes. Maybe biasing towards right and down actions in states closer to the bottom-right.

But since the environment is slippery, it's not straightforward. For example, taking an action that tends to move right or down but also has alternative paths if those don't work out.

Another approach is to use a greedy strategy where from each state, the agent tries to move directly towards 15 as much as possible given the slipperiness. This might involve choosing actions that have a higher chance of leading closer.

But without knowing the exact hole positions, it's tricky. However, based on standard FrozenLake, I can assume some holes and avoid them in the policy.

Let me try to draft a new set of params:

- For states along the top row (0-3), encourage moving down towards the goal.
- For states along the leftmost column (0,4,8,12), maybe move right or down depending on proximity to the goal.
- Avoid actions that could lead into known hole areas.

After considering all this, I think a possible new set of params could be:

params[0]: 3; params[1]: 2; params[2]: 1; ... etc. But I need to ensure it's unique and hasn't been tried before.

Looking at the previous top params, many have similar patterns with varying actions in different states. So I'll create a new one where some key states have different actions than what was previously seen, especially in areas near the holes or closer to the goal.
