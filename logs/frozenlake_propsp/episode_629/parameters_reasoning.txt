You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The agent moves in a 4x4 grid, and it's slippery, meaning each action can lead to three possible directions with equal probability. The goal is state 15, which gives +1 reward, but there are holes that end the episode.

First, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. Each state has four possible actions (0-3), and the policy is a fixed mapping from each state to an action. The challenge is that due to the slippery nature, choosing an optimal action isn't straightforward because of the stochasticity in movement.

Looking at the provided data, the top-performing policies have average rewards around 0.25-0.30, which is much lower than the target of 1.0. This suggests that current policies are not efficiently reaching the goal or are falling into holes too often.

The recent attempts seem to be getting very low rewards (even negative), so I'm in "Explorer" mode. My goal now is to propose a new set of parameters that haven't been tried before, focusing on exploring different paths to reach state 15 while avoiding holes.

I'll start by examining the grid and identifying safe paths. From state 0 (top-left corner), possible moves are down, left, or up. Since moving left would take it to state -1 (out of bounds) which is likely a hole, perhaps staying right or down is safer. But considering the slippery nature, each action has three outcomes.

I think setting policies that guide towards the goal while avoiding risky states is key. For example, in the top row (states 0-3), moving right might be better to approach state 7 (which is close to 15). Similarly, in other rows, actions should be chosen to move towards the right or down towards the goal.

I need to ensure that each state's action leads the agent closer to the goal without getting stuck in loops or falling into holes. Maybe assigning certain actions based on the grid position—like always moving right when possible and down otherwise.

Looking at recent attempts, some policies got stuck in cycles or didn't progress towards the goal effectively. So I need a policy that ensures movement towards 15 while considering all possible outcomes due to slipperiness.

I'll draft a new set of parameters where each state chooses an action that statistically increases the chances of moving closer to 15, minimizing the risk of hitting holes. For example:

- From state 0: Choose right (action 1), which could lead to states 4, 1, or 3. Moving towards state 3 is a step towards the goal.
- From state 1: Choose down (action 0), leading to state 5, 1, or -1. Avoiding moving left would prevent falling into holes if state -1 is a hole.
  
I'll continue this approach for each state, ensuring that actions are chosen to move towards higher-numbered states, especially those closer to 15. This should maximize the chances of reaching the goal and minimize falls into holes.

After considering all states, I'll structure the params array accordingly, making sure it's unique from previous attempts and follows a logical path toward the goal.
