You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I need to help find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me first understand the setup properly.

The environment is a 4x4 grid where each cell represents a state from 0 to 15. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) and get a reward of +1. All other states give 0, but some are holes that end the episode if stepped on.

The agent's actions aren't straightforward because the environment is slippery. Depending on which action the agent chooses, it moves in three possible directions with equal probability. For example, choosing action 0 might result in moving down, left, or up each with a 1/3 chance.

My task is to propose a policy (params array of length 16) where each element is an action from 0-3 that the agent should take when in that state. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward, which for optimal policies should be around 1.0.

Looking at the history provided, the top-performing policies have rewards around 0.25-0.30, which is significantly below the target of 1.0. This suggests that none of the current policies are consistently reaching state 15 without falling into holes or getting stuck in loops.

The recent policies show trajectories where the agent either gets stuck near the top-left (states 0,4, etc.) or meanders around without progressing towards the goal. For example, one policy's trajectory ends after several moves without ever reaching state 15.

To improve upon this, I need to propose a new set of parameters that guide the agent more effectively towards the goal while avoiding holes. Since we're in an exploration phase (as rewards are below 1), it's important to try different strategies and capture new information about which states lead to success or failure.

I should consider designing policies that push the agent towards the right and down, as these directions would generally move it closer to state 15. For example, in state 0 (top-left corner), choosing action 2 (which has a mix of up, right, down) might help because moving right from 0 could take it to state 3, which is one step closer.

Wait, no—moving right from state 0 would actually keep it in the same row but move it to state 1, not state 3. Hmm, maybe I need to think about the grid layout again. Let me visualize it: rows are top (0-3), then 4-7, 8-11, and 12-15 at the bottom.

From state 0, moving right goes to state 1, down to state 4, up isn't possible since it's already on the top row. So action 0 would allow the agent to move down, left (but can't go beyond 0), or up (also impossible). Wait, no—action definitions are based on what they try to do, regardless of boundaries. But in reality, moving left from state 0 might wrap around or stay put? Or does it just not move?

Wait, the problem statement says that when the agent takes an action, it picks one of three directions with equal probability. For example, action 0 allows movement down, left, up. So from state 0 (top-left), moving up isn't possible because it's at the top—so perhaps in such cases, those movements are invalid and the agent stays put? Or maybe they just don't count as valid moves, so the probability is distributed among possible directions.

This complicates things because the actual movement probabilities depend on the state. So, for example, in state 0 (top-left), action 0's three options would have down, left, and up. But since moving up or left from state 0 might not be possible, perhaps only one direction is possible? Or do they just try to move, but if it's impossible, the agent doesn't move.

Wait, no—the problem says that when taking an action, the agent picks from three directions with equal probability. So for state 0 and action 0, the agent has a 1/3 chance to move down (to state 4), left (but can't go beyond state 0, so perhaps it stays at 0?), or up (which isn't possible on the top row, so again, maybe it doesn't move). But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe in such cases, the agent just tries to move in that direction but remains in place if it's impossible.

This is a bit unclear, but for the purposes of this problem, perhaps we can assume that all three directions are possible even if they don't change the state—like, moving left from state 0 would result in staying at state 0. So action 0 from state 0 gives a 1/3 chance to move down (to 4), left (stay at 0), or up (also stay at 0). Therefore, taking action 0 from state 0 has a 1/3 chance of moving down and 2/3 chance of staying put.

Similarly, other states have different movement possibilities. For example, in state 8 (top-left of the third row), taking action 0 would allow moving down to 12, left (stay at 8?), or up to 4.

Given this complexity, perhaps a good strategy is for each state to push towards the goal as much as possible. So, from state 0, choosing an action that has a high probability of moving right or down would be better.

Looking back at the previous policies, most seem to cycle near the top-left without making progress. To break this cycle, I should propose a policy where states in the upper rows tend to move down or right, and states on the left side tend to move right or down.

For example:

- In state 0 (top-left), action 2 allows moving up, right, or down. But since moving up isn't possible, it might have a higher chance of moving right or down than other actions. Alternatively, choosing action 1 which includes moving right, down, left—so from state 0, action 1 would have a chance to move right (to 1), down (to 4), or left (stay at 0). Maybe action 1 is better because it has a higher chance of moving towards the goal.

Wait, but in state 0, taking action 2 would mean trying to move up, which isn't possible. So action 2's possible moves are right and down with some probability. Similarly for other states.

Perhaps I should design each state's policy to try to move towards either increasing the row (down) or increasing the column (right), depending on their position.

For example:

- States in the first row (0-3): prefer moving down or right.
- States in the last row (12-15): since reaching 15 is the goal, perhaps they should stay put? Or move right if possible.
- Middle rows: depending on their column, decide whether to move right or down.

But without knowing which states are holes, it's tricky. The problem says that some states are holes but doesn't specify which ones. So the agent must learn which states are safe based on previous trajectories.

From the provided examples, certain states seem to be dangerous because agents tend to fall into them. For instance, state 15 is the goal, so any trajectory ending there is successful. But other states might lead to holes.

Given that all policies so far have low rewards (max 0.3), it's clear that either the agent isn't reaching the goal often or is falling into holes frequently.

To address this, I need a policy that navigates towards the goal while minimizing the risk of falling into holes.

Perhaps focusing on states that are near the bottom-right would help. For example:

- In state 14 (second to last cell in the third row), taking action 3 might try to move right or up, which could lead to the goal or a hole.
- Alternatively, taking action 0 from state 14 might move down to 15, which is the goal.

Similarly, in state 11 (bottom-right of the third row), moving down would reach 15.

So, I should set policies for states that are closer to the goal to push towards it. For example:

- State 11: action 0 (down) → leads to 15.
- State 8: action 2 (right or up) might not help; perhaps better to move down to 12.
- Wait, but without knowing which states are holes, this is speculative.

Given the uncertainty, I think a reasonable approach is to design policies that push towards the goal as much as possible. For example:

- From even-numbered columns (0, 2) in any row, prefer moving right; from odd-numbered columns, prefer moving down.
- Alternatively, always try to move towards increasing column numbers.

But given the slippery nature and possible holes, it's a balance between exploration and exploitation.

Perhaps setting up policies where:

- In states that are in rows above the third, move down if possible.
- In states on the left side of any row, move right.
- In states closer to the goal (like 12-15), try moving right or down as needed.

Another thought: since movement is probabilistic, the agent's path is somewhat random. So setting up a policy that encourages more downward and rightward movements might statistically lead the agent towards the goal more often.

Putting this together, I'll propose a new set of parameters where:

- In states 0,4,8 (top-left of each row), choose action 2 or 3 to push towards moving right and down.
- In other states, prefer actions that move towards increasing column numbers or rows closer to the bottom.

But without knowing which are holes, it's tricky. For example, state 5 is in the second row; if I set params[5] to action 0 (down), it might lead to a hole, but if action 1 leads towards the goal, that would be better.

Alternatively, perhaps focusing on making sure that when the agent is near the bottom-right, it takes actions that directly lead to state 15.

Given all this, I'll draft a new policy where:

- For states in the first column (0,4,8), choose action 2 (which includes moving right and down).
- For other states, prefer moving towards increasing columns or rows.

But since movement is probabilistic, it's a bit of a gamble. Maybe another approach is to have each state push towards the goal as much as possible without getting stuck in loops.

Perhaps setting up a policy where:

- States 0-3 (top row) tend to move down.
- States in columns 1 and 2 of the second and third rows move right or down.
- States near the bottom-right move directly towards state 15.

But without knowing which are holes, it's hard. So perhaps I'll propose a policy where most states choose actions that have a high chance of moving towards the goal, with some randomness to explore and avoid getting stuck in loops.

For example:

params[0] = 2 (action 2: up, right, down). From state 0, this has a chance to move right or down.
params[1] = 3 (action 3: left, up, right). This might help move right from state 1.
...
I'll need to fill in all 16 states.

But considering time constraints, perhaps I can propose a policy where each state chooses an action that generally moves towards the goal. For example:

- In even-numbered states (0,2,4,...), choose action 2 or 3.
- In odd-numbered states, choose action 1 or 3.

Alternatively, set up a simple policy where from any state, if possible, move right; otherwise, move down.

But given the slippery nature, this might not always work. For example, moving right from state 0 leads to 1, which is better than staying put.

Putting it all together, perhaps I'll propose:

params[0] = 2 (action 2: up, right, down)
params[1] = 3 (action 3: left, up, right)
...
I think this approach will encourage exploration towards the goal while having some variance to avoid getting stuck.

Wait, but in the previous top policies, they had similar structures. Maybe I need a more systematic approach.

Another thought: use a greedy policy where each state chooses an action that has the highest probability of moving towards the goal, considering possible movements.

For example:

- From state 0 (top-left), action 2 allows moving up, right, or down. But moving right is better to proceed towards the goal. So maybe action 2 is okay.
- From state 1, action 3 (left, up, right) gives a chance to move left (back to 0) or right (to 2), which might not be ideal. Alternatively, action 1 allows moving right, down, left—so from state 1, action 1 might have a higher chance of moving towards the goal.

This is getting complicated without knowing the hole positions. Given that, perhaps I'll propose a policy where each state chooses an action that has a high likelihood of increasing either row or column index, which would move closer to state 15.

So:

- For states in rows 0 and 2 (top two rows), prefer moving down.
- For states in columns 0 and 2 (leftmost and middle columns), prefer moving right.

But again, without hole info, this is speculative.

Given the time constraints, I'll propose a new set of parameters where each state's action is chosen to move towards increasing row or column indices as much as possible.
