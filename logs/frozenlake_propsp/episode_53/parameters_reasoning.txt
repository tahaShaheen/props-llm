You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, let's try to figure out the best policy parameters for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with a reward of +1 and avoid stepping on holes. The current policy uses values from [0,1,2,3], which correspond to actions—left, down, up, or right.

First, I need to understand the problem better. The environment is slippery, meaning each action has an equal probability when taking certain actions. So, for example, action 0 (down) randomly chooses between moving down, left, and up with equal chance. Similarly, other actions also have similar probabilities but different sets of moves.

The agent explores through previously visited trajectories, so it needs to remember its experiences from the past. The goal is to find a policy that maximizes the expected reward by learning from these experiences without revisiting old ones too much.

Looking at the top performing parameters provided in the examples, some have 2, others have 3, but they seem to have varying combinations. For instance, params[0]:2,1:0,2:3 and so on. The f(params) is around 0.25 or higher in two cases.

I should consider how each action affects the policy. Action 3 (left) and action 1 (right) seem more promising since they don't have constraints like actions 0 and 2. But the rewards are only +1, so the agent needs to avoid negative outcomes.

Perhaps experimenting with policies where action 3 is taken more often when in certain states could be beneficial. For example, starting from state 0, taking action 3 (left) would get it to state 15 directly, which is a hole—wait, no, state 15 is the goal, so moving right or left from state 0 leads back to higher-numbered grids.

Wait, in the environment description, when stepping onto a hole, the game ends. So if the agent steps on a hole, it gets zero reward and that path terminates. However, since all other states except 15 yield +1, moving into a hole would result in no reward for that step but end the exploration.

So, to avoid holes, the policy should prioritize not stepping on them. But with the slippery action probabilities, sometimes taking an action might lead back to a hole. Therefore, perhaps we can adjust the parameters so that certain actions are less likely when near holes.

But given the current examples, some policies have params[0] as 2 and others as 1, but similar for other states. Maybe the optimal policy is somewhere in between or has a different pattern.

Another angle: since all non-hole states give +1, perhaps focusing on reducing the probability of stepping into holes could help. However, the grid's structure means that some positions are near each other and can lead to stepping into holes.

Perhaps trying action 3 (left) more often when in certain states where it avoids getting stuck or near a hole. Alternatively, using parameters where action 1 (right, down, left) is used less frequently when on lower-numbered grids could be beneficial.

I might need to try different parameter combinations and observe the f(params) each time. If I can identify a pattern that consistently yields higher rewards without failing to reach the goal due to getting stuck or stepping into holes, that would be optimal.
