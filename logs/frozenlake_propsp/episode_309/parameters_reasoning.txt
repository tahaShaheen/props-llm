You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, let's try to figure out what the best policy is for this FrozenLake environment. So, from what I understand, it's a 4x4 grid where each cell can be represented by a number from 0 to 15. The goal is to reach state 15, which gives a reward of +1, but there are holes that end the episode if stepped on.

The environment is slippery, meaning when you take an action, there's a 33% chance it could go in one of three directions. So, for each action, the agent might not move exactly where it intended. That makes things a bit tricky because the policy needs to account for this uncertainty.

Looking at the problem, we're supposed to find the global optimal policy by iteratively proposing different parameter settings and getting feedback on their average reward over 20 episodes. The goal is to get as close to an episodic reward of 1.0 as possible, which would mean the agent reliably reaches the goal without falling into any holes.

The user provided some previous examples of params and their corresponding rewards. From these, it seems that most policies are getting around 0.15 to 0.25 average reward, which is quite low. The best so far is 0.25, but we need to get closer to 1.0.

I also noticed the trajectories provided for some of these params. For instance, one policy led to a trajectory that reached state 8 (which is in the third row) and then took action 2, which could move up, right, or down with equal probability. But it didn't reach the goal, so maybe the path taken wasn't optimal.

Another thing to consider is how the agent's actions can avoid holes. Since the environment has holes, the policy needs to ensure that from any state, the chosen action doesn't lead into a hole with any possible outcome of the slippery movement.

Given that we're in iteration 309 out of 5000, and the rewards are still low, I think we need to explore more. The user mentioned that if the rewards are far below 1.0, the strategy is to act as an "explorer" by choosing a new configuration distinct from previous ones.

Looking at the most recent params provided, they didn't yield high rewards. So perhaps changing up the actions in key states could help. For example, maybe certain states near the goal need different actions to ensure that despite the slipperiness, the agent can reach the goal without falling into holes.

I should focus on ensuring that from each state, especially those closer to the goal, the chosen action has a high probability of moving towards the goal or staying safe. Since each action leads to three possible moves with equal chance, it's crucial that at least one of those moves is a step closer to the goal without hitting any holes.

For example, in state 0 (the top-left corner), taking action 2 (which can move up, right, or down) might be beneficial. From state 0, moving right would take it to state 1, which is adjacent. But since movement is slippery, maybe a different action could lead it towards the goal more reliably.

I need to map out possible paths and ensure that for each state, the chosen action maximizes the chance of reaching the goal without stepping into any holes. It might help to have a deterministic path in mind but account for the 33% randomness by choosing actions that have multiple safe or productive outcomes.

Perhaps I should try setting certain key states (like those near the goal) to specific actions that could lead towards the goal even if one of the three possible moves is chosen. For instance, state 12 (which is the bottom-left corner) should probably move right because moving down would be out of bounds, but since it's a 4x4 grid, maybe moving right or up?

Wait, actually, in a 4x4 grid, each row has 4 states. So rows are 0-3 (top), 4-7 (second), 8-11 (third), and 12-15 (bottom). So state 12 is the bottom-left, 13 is bottom-middle left, 14 is middle-right, and 15 is goal.

So from state 12, moving right would go to 13, up would go to 8, or down might be invalid? Or does it wrap around? No, I think moving down from the bottom row stays in place. Wait, no—the movement probably doesn't wrap; if you try to move beyond the grid, you stay put.

Wait, actually, in many FrozenLake environments, moving into a direction that's out of bounds keeps you in the same state. So for example, moving right from state 3 (top-right) would keep you at state 3 because there's no state 4 in row 0 beyond column 3.

So considering that, from state 12 (bottom-left), moving right goes to 13, up goes to 8 (third row, same column), and down might stay at 12 if the grid doesn't allow movement beyond. But I'm not entirely sure—perhaps it's better to assume that attempting to move beyond the grid keeps you in place.

Given that, for state 12, action 3 would be [left, up, right]. So moving left from 12 is impossible (stays at 12), up goes to 8, and right goes to 13. So with equal probability, each of these could happen. But if the agent takes action 3 in state 12, it has a chance to move towards the goal (state 15) via moving right or up.

Alternatively, taking action 0 would have [down, left, up], but since down from state 12 is impossible, it might not be as useful. So perhaps setting params[12] to 3 could be beneficial because moving right has a chance to get closer to the goal.

Similarly, for other states near the goal, like 14 and 13, choosing actions that have a high probability of moving towards 15 would be good.

Looking at the previous top-performing params, some had action 2 set in certain states. Maybe mixing up the actions could lead to better exploration and eventual discovery of the optimal path.

Another approach is to model this as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) where each state transitions probabilistically based on the action taken. The goal is to find a policy that maximizes the expected reward, which in this case is reaching state 15 without hitting any holes.

Since the environment is slippery and has stochasticity, the optimal policy must be robust to these uncertainties. It needs to choose actions that, on average, lead towards the goal while avoiding dangerous states (holes).

Given all this, perhaps I should propose a new set of params where key states are assigned actions that have a high chance of moving towards the goal or staying safe. For example:

- States near the goal (13, 14, 15) might need specific actions to ensure reaching 15.
- Middle states should aim to move right or down if possible to approach the goal.

But without knowing where exactly the holes are located, it's a bit tricky because we don't want the agent to step into them. However, since the user provided trajectories that sometimes led to falls, I can infer some of these dangerous states.

For instance, looking at one trajectory: (0,3) (0,3) (1,2) (1,2)... which suggests that moving down from state 0 with action 3 might lead to state 4 or something else. But without knowing the exact hole locations, I have to be cautious.

Perhaps a good strategy is to make the agent move towards the right and down as much as possible because that's generally the direction of the goal (state 15). So setting actions in states to push the agent further right and down.

In state 0, taking action 2 could move up, right, or down. Moving right from 0 is good because it goes to state 1, which is towards the goal. Similarly, in state 1, moving right would go to state 2, etc.

But I have to ensure that from each state, at least one of the possible moves doesn't lead into a hole. So maybe mapping out safe paths and ensuring that for each state, the chosen action has a path that avoids holes.

Alternatively, perhaps using Q-learning or value iteration could help find the optimal policy, but since we're constrained to propose params without knowing previous states, it's challenging.

Given all this, I think the best approach is to propose a new set of parameters where key states are assigned actions that push towards the goal and avoid known dangerous areas. Since the user mentioned not to repeat previous params, I'll make sure the proposed params are distinct from those seen earlier.
