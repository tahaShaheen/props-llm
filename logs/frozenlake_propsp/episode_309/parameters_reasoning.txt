You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment using a policy optimizer based on the given setup. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The environment is a 4x4 grid where each state is labeled from 0 to 15. The goal is to reach state 15, which is the right-bottom corner. The agent can move left, down, right, or up. The policy is represented as an array of 16 numbers (since there are 16 states), where each number corresponds to a specific action when in that state. The values for these actions are chosen from [0,1,2,3].

The reward structure is such that all non-goal states give 0, and the goal state (15) gives +1. The policy needs to explore through the holes in the map, which I assume means avoiding certain paths.

Now, the policy parameters are initialized to [0:0, 1:0, 2:0, ...]. These represent the initial actions for each state. My task is to find an optimal set of these parameters using a learning algorithm (like Q-Learning or SARSA) that maximizes the reward over time.

The user will provide the number of iterations and some training examples. I need to choose my own parameter values from [0,1,2,3] for each state. The goal is to find a set where the policy explores all possible paths, avoiding the holes (which are not specified here) but exploring through them.

I recall that in such grid-based environments, especially with multiple paths and holes, the optimal policy often involves some degree of exploration beyond the immediate rewards. For instance, sometimes taking a step down while expecting to go right can lead to better long-term outcomes by avoiding local minima.

Since I don't know which states are holes, but from the provided examples, it seems that certain states (like 4 and 7) might be problematic. So, perhaps the optimal policy avoids these or forces exploration through them.

Given that the policy is an array of actions, each state's action is selected based on maximizing some expected reward. Without specific details about which states are holes, I need to hypothesize based on common optimal strategies.

Let me consider possible high-performing parameters:

- For state 0 (top-left), a higher chance of taking action 2 (up) might be beneficial if it leads to other important paths.
- State 1 (top-second row) could take action 1 or 3, depending on what's better in the context.
- State 4 is the left-center and state 7 is right-center; avoiding them might require careful exploration.

Given that all parameters are chosen from [0,1,2,3], a possible optimal set might have each parameter as 1.5 or something, but since they must be integers, maybe a mix of 1s and 2s to encourage exploration between the known problematic states.
