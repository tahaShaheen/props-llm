You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help the user find the global optimal policy for a FrozenLake environment with some modifications. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The environment is a 4x4 grid where each state is represented by numbers from 0 to 15. The agent can move in four directions—left, down, right, up—but due to slipperiness, when it takes an action, it has a 33% chance of moving in one of three possible directions. The goal is to reach state 15 for a reward of +1, and all other states give 0. There are holes that end the episode if stepped on.

The policy is a function mapping each state to an action (0-3), represented by params[0] to params[15]. Each value must be one of [0,1,2,3]. The challenge is to optimize this policy over 5000 iterations, with the user providing feedback on the reward after each iteration.

Looking at the history, the top-performing policies are yielding around 0.15-0.20 rewards, which is quite low since the optimal should be near 1.0. The recent attempts have even lower rewards (down to 0), so I'm in "Explorer" mode—meaning I need to try new configurations significantly different from previous ones to gather more information.

The trajectories show that many policies get stuck or fall into holes. To avoid this, the policy should navigate towards state 15 while avoiding known holes. From prior knowledge of FrozenLake, optimal paths usually move right and down from start (state 0). But with the slipperiness, deterministic actions might not always reach the goal.

I think I need to design a policy that, for each state, chooses an action that increases the chances of moving towards the goal while avoiding risky moves. For example, in state 0 (top-left), moving right or down would be better. But considering slipperiness, maybe choosing actions that have a higher probability of moving towards the goal.

Looking at the top policies, they often choose action 1 for state 0, which allows movement to the right, left, or down with equal chance. That might be a good start because it opens up paths in multiple directions, potentially avoiding holes.

I should propose a new policy that varies from previous attempts. For instance, setting params[0] = 1, which would let the agent explore moving right, left, or down from the starting position. Similarly, other states should have actions that guide towards state 15 without falling into traps.

I'll construct a policy where each state's action is chosen to either move towards the goal or stay safe. For example:

- State 0: Action 1 (can go right, left, down)
- State 1: Maybe action 3 (up, which could help if it slips back, but might not be optimal)
- Continue this pattern for each state.

But I need to ensure that the actions don't lead into holes. From the trajectories, certain states are dangerous, like state 4 (which is in the second row). So, I'll set params[4] to an action that moves towards the goal without risking a fall.

After considering all this, I think setting each state's action to a mix of right and down movements, using actions 1 and 2 where possible, could help. However, since I can't remember previous attempts, I need to choose distinct values from what's been tried before, like avoiding the same pattern as in recent params.

So, my proposed new policy will set params[0] = 1, params[1] = 3, and so on, ensuring each state has a chance to move towards the goal without repeating previous strategies.
