You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, let's try to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with the highest possible reward of +1, while avoiding holes. Given that the agent moves in a slippery way, meaning each action can lead to three directions with equal probability, I need to design a policy that maximizes the chance of reaching the goal without falling into any holes.

First, I need to understand the grid layout and where the holes are. The user mentioned that some states are holes, but they haven't specified their exact positions. However, from the trajectories provided, I can infer some information about which states might be holes or dangerous.

Looking at the top 6 best performing params, all of them have an average reward around 0.15 to 0.10. This suggests that none of these policies are very effective at reaching the goal consistently. The most recent policies are even worse, with rewards around 0.00, which indicates that they're not successfully navigating towards the goal.

The trajectories provided give some clues about where the agent is moving and where it might be failing. For example, in one trajectory, the agent starts at state 0 (top-left corner) and takes action 1, leading to state 4. Then it takes action 2, moving down to state 8, which is another row over. This suggests that the policy is trying to move towards the goal but might be getting stuck or falling into holes.

Another trajectory shows the agent moving from state 0 to state 1 multiple times, then eventually taking a different path, but still not reaching the goal. This indicates that perhaps certain states are being revisited without making progress towards the target.

Given that all previous policies have low rewards, I should consider exploring new configurations. The user mentioned that the global optimal reward should be around 1.0, so my aim is to find a policy that can reach this level by avoiding holes and efficiently navigating towards state 15.

I'll think about each state and decide which action would maximize the chances of reaching the goal without stepping on a hole. Since the environment is slippery, each action has a 33% chance of going in three directions. Therefore, the policy needs to choose actions that have the highest probability of moving towards the goal while minimizing the risk of falling into holes.

For example, for state 0 (top-left corner), possible moves are down, right, or up with equal probability when action 1 is taken. However, since up from state 0 would lead out of bounds or perhaps to a hole, it's safer to choose actions that move towards the goal (right or down). Similarly, in other states, I need to ensure that the chosen action directs the agent towards the goal without leading it into known holes.

I'll start by considering each state and assigning an action based on their position relative to the goal. For example:

- States near the bottom-right should move right or up if possible.
- States in the top row might benefit from moving down towards the goal.
- Avoiding states that are likely holes is crucial, so I'll need to infer which states those might be based on past trajectories.

After analyzing the grid and considering the slippery nature of movement, I'll assign actions to each state in a way that balances exploration and exploitation. The aim is to reach the goal as quickly as possible while minimizing the risk of falling into holes.
