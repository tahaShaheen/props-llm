You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 633 out of 5000. OUTPUT ONLY THIS SINGLE LINE:

Do NOT output anything else. No explanation, no reasoning, nothing.

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the globally optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me break down what I know and how I can approach this.

First, the environment is a 4x4 grid with states numbered from 0 to 15. The goal is state 15 (bottom right corner), which gives +1 reward. All other states give 0. There are holes in the map that end the episode if stepped on. The slippery nature of the environment causes actions to result in three possible moves each with equal probability.

The policy is an array of 16 numbers, each representing the action taken from state i. Each element can be 0,1,2,3. I need to propose a new set of params each iteration without repeating any previous ones and maximize the reward.

Looking at the top best performing params, they have f(params) around 0.2-0.3. The most recent attempts are giving lower rewards (down to 0.05), so according to the strategy, since rewards are below 1.0, I should be in "Explorer" mode and choose a new configuration distinct from previous ones.

I also need to avoid any params that have been proposed before. From the history given, I see several param configurations, but none seem to reach the goal consistently. The trajectories show that agents often fall into loops or get stuck near holes.

So, as an explorer, I should try a new set of actions that haven't been tried yet. Perhaps setting some states to move towards the right and down more directly, considering the goal is at state 15.

Looking at state 0 (top-left), moving right (action 3) might be better since it can go right, down, or up. From state 0, action 3 would have a chance to move right to state 1, which could lead towards higher states. Similarly, other states should have actions that push the agent closer to the goal.

I need to ensure that these actions don't lead into holes. Maybe setting certain key states like near the center or around the edges to take specific actions to avoid known holes.

After considering all this, I'll propose a new set of params where each state chooses an action that generally moves towards the right and down but also varies enough to explore different paths and avoid falling into holes.
