You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to find the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment using a reinforcement learning approach. The goal is to reach state 15 (the right-bottom grid) and get as much reward as possible. The agent has four actions: move down, left, up, or right. Each action leads to different probabilities of choosing each direction based on certain parameters.

The parameters are an array of 16 values, each between 0 and 3, representing the action (index) when the state is at position i. For example, params[0] tells us which action to take in state 0. Each parameter can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.

The problem says that the global optimal reward should be around None, meaning we need to find a policy with decent performance. However, the agent is currently at iteration 356 out of 400, and I have to propose parameters from [0,1,2,3].

Looking at the top-performing params in the TOP 10 table, several seem promising:

- params[0] = 2 (down) when on state 8.
- params[1] = 3 (right) when on state 9.

But wait, I need to consider all 16 parameters. Maybe some are better elsewhere. For instance, in the top reward parameter, params[4] is high for state 0 and 4, but others might be more optimal overall.

I should also look at recent examples given:

- One with params around [2,3,1,3,0] gives a reward of 0.25.
- Another with params like [2,3,1,3,2] also gives 0.25.
- A more favorable one has higher rewards for states 0 and 4, but perhaps other parameters could be better.

I should try to balance the exploration by not revisiting previous worse policies. Since some high-performing params have lower values in others, I need a mix that covers all possibilities without missing any key actions.

Perhaps adjusting params[2] (up) when on state 0 and 4 might help avoid getting stuck. Also, ensuring that certain directions are chosen more often for safe transitions is important to prevent falling into holes.

Wait, but the hole in the map is at some states, so avoiding stepping on them is crucial. The provided examples don't have a clear picture of where the holes are, but I need to make sure my policy doesn't fall into any of them, which could cause termination with -1 reward or similar.

I should also think about which actions are more likely to lead to higher rewards without risking stepping on holes. For example, action 3 (left) might sometimes be better than others because it's less dangerous in certain states.

After considering all these factors, I decide that a balanced approach where each state uses the parameter corresponding to safe transitions should yield good results. This means making sure that in key positions, the parameters guide the agent safely towards the goal without risking falls.
