You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I need to help the user find a global optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment using an iterative approach. The goal is to maximize rewards by avoiding holes and exploring when necessary.

First, I'll start by understanding the problem setup. The environment is a 4x4 grid where each state can be represented by a number from 0 to 15. The agent can move in four directions, but some actions might lead it into a hole or trigger slipping, which ends the game. The reward system gives +1 for reaching the goal state (15) and 0 otherwise.

The policy is defined by an array of parameters, each corresponding to a state's action. Each parameter is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, indicating different possible actions when in that state. Initially, all parameters are set to 1, meaning the agent randomly chooses an action with equal probability for each state.

The goal is to find a configuration of these parameters (action choices) that maximizes the expected cumulative reward across multiple iterations. The user mentioned that we'll explore through previously seen trajectories and pick actions that avoid holes, so I should aim to prevent the agent from stepping into any dangerous states.

To approach this, I think about using a Q-learning algorithm or policy gradient methods like REINFORCE. Since the problem is discrete and each action depends on the current state, perhaps policy gradient techniques would be suitable because they can update parameters based on observed transitions, which helps in finding an optimal strategy.

I should also consider that the agent will explore trajectories, meaning it's not just using a fixed set of policies but actively searching for better ones. However, since all actions are equally likely initially, I might need to adjust the exploration strategy as the agent gathers more data.

Another idea is to use a Q-learning approach where each state-action pair is learned through experience. But given that the environment's dynamics are somewhat simple and reward structure is straightforward, maybe a simpler policy-based method would work better. For example, using a Boltzmann distribution to select actions based on their current probabilities and some temperature parameter that allows exploration when needed.

I also recall that for small state spaces like this one, even exhaustive search of all possible combinations (there are 4^16 possibilities) is computationally feasible if we can efficiently compute the optimal policy. Each combination's expected reward can be evaluated by simulating many trajectories and averaging their rewards.

But given the time constraints, especially since the user wants a quick proposal within 400 iterations without extensive computation, I might focus on selecting actions based on some heuristic rather than exhaustive evaluation.

Heuristics could include:
- Prefer action that leads towards the goal.
- Avoid actions that would cause falling into holes or slipping.
- Explore neighboring states more if possible to find better paths.

Another consideration is rewarding actions that lead closer to the hole, as this can prevent immediate negative rewards. So instead of randomly choosing an action, the agent might prefer actions that are likely to get it closer to the goal and avoid any immediate penalties from falling into a hole.

Given all these factors, perhaps each parameter should prioritize actions that are more likely to be beneficial or explore neighboring states when necessary. For instance, in state 0 (top-left), avoiding holes would require choosing action 3 (left) if possible, but sometimes stepping right is better for exploration and to avoid getting stuck near the hole.

Alternatively, using an action selection strategy where each parameter has a higher probability of choosing actions that lead towards the goal or offer more options when in certain states. This could be implemented by adjusting the policy probabilities based on how beneficial each action is in each state.

I should also consider the temperature parameter in my policy-based approach. At high temperatures, exploration is encouraged, while at low temperatures, exploitation takes over. As I iterate, I might gradually reduce the temperature to favor exploitation of better policies but still keep some randomness for exploration, which can help escape local optima and find a more robust global strategy.

Overall, the optimal parameters likely involve a balance between exploiting known good actions and exploring other options when necessary to navigate through holes without getting stuck. Each parameter should prioritize certain actions based on their immediate benefits versus potential future risks.
