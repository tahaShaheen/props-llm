You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out the best policy parameters for this FrozenLake environment. Let me start by understanding the problem.

So, it's a 4x4 grid with states numbered from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). The goal is to reach state 15 for a reward of +1, but there are holes that end the episode if stepped on. The environment is slippery, meaning each action leads to one of three possible directions with equal probability.

The policy is an array of 16 actions, each corresponding to a state. My task is to find the optimal set of actions (params) that maximizes the reward, ideally around 1.0, which suggests near-perfect performance.

Looking at the interaction history:

- The user provided some top params with average rewards around 0.45, which isn't great but better than others.
- The most recent params had even lower rewards (0.20 and 0.00), suggesting they might not be effective.

Since I'm supposed to act as a stateless optimizer, I need to decide whether to explore or exploit based on the current reward levels. Since the rewards are below 1.0, especially the recent ones being low, it indicates that exploration is needed rather than exploitation.

I should propose a new set of params that's significantly different from previous ones to gather more information about which states lead to holes and which path leads to the goal effectively.

Looking at the top params, they seem to have some patterns, but given the low rewards, perhaps they're not avoiding holes well. Maybe changing certain key states' actions could help. For instance, state 0 is currently set to action 1 in the best performing params. Perhaps trying a different action there, like action 3 or 2, might lead to a better path.

Similarly, for other critical states like 7 (which is at the end of the second row) and 8 (start of the third row), changing their actions could influence whether the agent falls into holes or progresses towards the goal.

I should generate a params array that varies as much as possible from previous attempts but still makes sense strategically. For example, making sure that states near the edges are moving towards the right or down when appropriate, avoiding left or up which might lead into holes.

After considering all this, I think setting some key states to different actions while keeping others consistent with good policies could help improve the reward. Let me draft a new set of params accordingly.
