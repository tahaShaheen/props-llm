You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 113 out of 5000. OUTPUT ONLY THIS SINGLE LINE:
params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W
Do NOT output anything else. No explanation, no reasoning, nothing.



LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get a reward of 1 by reaching state 15, but there are holes that end the episode if stepped on. The agent can move in four directions, but due to the slippery nature, each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability.

First, I need to understand the grid layout and which states are holes. From the problem description, it seems that some states are holes, but they aren't explicitly listed. So my policy needs to avoid actions that could lead into these holes based on previous trajectories.

Looking at the top 6 best-performing params, most of them have a reward around 0.15, which is pretty low. That suggests that none of the current policies are getting close to the optimal reward of 1.0. The trajectories provided show that agents often fall into holes or get stuck in loops without reaching the goal.

Since we're at iteration 113 and rewards are far below 1.0, I should act as an Explorer. My goal is to propose a new set of params that hasn't been tried before, exploring new areas to gather more information about where the holes are and how to reach the goal.

I need to make sure each state's action choice doesn't lead into known or suspected holes. For example, from state 0 (top-left), if moving left or up is impossible, then actions that might cause those moves should be avoided. Similarly, for other states, I'll choose actions that increase the likelihood of reaching state 15 without falling into any holes.

Considering the movement probabilities and the slippery nature, each action choice from a state should ideally lead towards the goal as much as possible while minimizing the risk of stepping into holes. For instance, from state 0, choosing an action that mainly moves down or right would be better since those directions are more likely to get closer to the goal.

I'll iterate through each state and assign actions that push towards the goal, ensuring a balance between exploration and exploitation without repeating previous policies.
