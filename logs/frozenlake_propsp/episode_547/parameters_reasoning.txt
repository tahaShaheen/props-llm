You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out the best possible policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to maximize the reward by reaching state 15 without falling into any holes. Since it's a slippery environment, each action has three possible outcomes with equal probability.

First, I need to understand the layout of the grid and where the holes are. From the trajectories provided, I can infer some information about which states might be holes. For example, one trajectory went from (0,3) to (1,3), suggesting that state 3 isn't a hole because the agent moved right into it. Another trajectory fell into a hole, but I need to see exactly where.

Looking at the top 6 best-performing params and their trajectories, I notice that some paths lead to holes or get stuck in loops. For instance, one policy kept moving left from state 0 and eventually reached state 4, which might be a safe state. Another trajectory went through states (0,1) → (4,2) → (8,2), indicating that these are safe.

I should focus on creating a policy that navigates towards the goal (state 15) while avoiding known dangerous areas. The optimal strategy likely involves moving right and down more often since those directions lead closer to the goal.

However, because of the slippery nature, I need to choose actions that increase the probability of reaching the goal despite the stochasticity. For example, if from state 0, choosing action 2 (which can move up, right, or down) might help in exploring different paths.

I also need to ensure that each state's action choice doesn't lead into a hole with any possible movement. So, for each state i, I should select an action that minimizes the chance of moving into a hole and maximizes the chance of moving towards the goal.

Given the recent policies provided, it seems like some are not performing well (like the one yielding 0.00 reward). To improve, I might want to adjust certain states' actions to move more directly towards the goal or avoid loops.

After considering all this, I think a good starting point is to set most actions to either right (action 1) or down (action 0), depending on their position relative to the goal. For example, in the top row, moving right would be beneficial, while in the first column, moving down is better.

I should also check if any of the provided policies are close to optimal and tweak them slightly. But since I'm supposed to maximize information gain, perhaps proposing a new configuration that hasn't been tried before but has potential to reach higher rewards is better.

Finally, after this line of thinking, I'll propose a set of parameters where each state's action choice directs the agent towards the goal without leading into known dangerous paths.
