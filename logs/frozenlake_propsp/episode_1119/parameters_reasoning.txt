You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get the highest possible reward by reaching state 15 without falling into any holes. From what I understand, the environment is slippery, meaning each action has a 33% chance of going in one of three directions. 

Looking at the top 5 performing policies provided, most of them have similar structures but with some variations in certain states. The highest reward so far is 0.45, which isn't too bad, but we're aiming for around 1.0. This suggests that there's room for improvement.

I notice that in many of the top policies, states near the goal (like 12, 13, 14) have actions that might not be optimal. For example, if the agent is at state 15, it should obviously stay there since it's the goal. But for other states leading to it, maybe choosing actions that increase the chance of moving right or down would help.

Also, considering the slippery nature, it's crucial to choose actions that have a higher probability of getting closer to the goal even with the 3-way randomness. For instance, if an agent is in state 12 (which is at row 3, column 0), choosing action 0 might move it down, but since it's already in the bottom row, perhaps moving right or up could be better. Wait, no—since from state 12, moving right would take it to state 13, which is one step closer to the goal. So maybe for state 12, action 2 (which has a chance to move up, right, or down) might help.

Another thing I'm noticing is that some policies are getting stuck in loops because they're not avoiding holes effectively. For example, in the trajectory provided earlier, agents were moving back and forth between certain states without making progress towards the goal. So, it's essential to design a policy that avoids such cycles.

I think a good starting point would be to ensure that each state has an action that generally moves the agent closer to the goal while minimizing the chances of falling into holes. Since the environment is slippery, we can't control every step, but we can try to maximize the probability of moving in the right direction on average.

For instance:
- In states near the top-left (0-3), maybe actions that encourage moving down or right would help.
- In middle states, choosing actions that push towards the bottom-right might be better.
- For states close to the goal, actions that try to move further right or down should be prioritized.

Also, looking at the recent policies, some have high rewards but others are lower. This indicates that we're exploring different regions of the policy space, which is good for finding the optimal solution. But since our current best is around 0.45, I need to think about how to tweak these parameters to get closer to 1.0.

I recall that in some policies, certain states were set to take specific actions regardless of their position. Maybe adjusting those could help. For example, if a state near the goal isn't set to move towards it, changing its action might lead to higher rewards.

Given all this, I'll try to propose a new policy where each state's action is chosen to maximize the chance of moving closer to the goal while avoiding holes. This might involve setting actions that generally point towards the right or down, especially in states away from the goal, and more conservative actions as we get closer.
