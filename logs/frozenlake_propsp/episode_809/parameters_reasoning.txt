You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with the highest possible reward, avoiding holes. Given that it's slippery, each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability.

Looking at the problem, the agent can choose from four actions: left (0), down (1), right (2), and up (3). However, due to the slipperiness, each action actually has a 1/3 chance of moving in one of three directions. So, for example, if I take action 0 (left), there's a 33% chance to go left, down, or up.

From the user's message, I can see that previous policies have been tried, but none are reaching the optimal reward of around 1.0 yet. The most recent params have given rewards as low as 0.45 and as high as 0.25, which suggests that the current strategies aren't very effective.

I need to come up with a new set of parameters. Since I'm supposed to maximize information gain, I should pick a configuration that's distinct from what's been tried before and might explore different paths towards state 15 without falling into holes.

Looking at the top-performing params, many of them seem to have high values in certain areas, but they might be leading the agent into loops or dangerous states. For example, some policies get stuck moving around without making progress toward the goal.

I think a good strategy is to create a policy that directs the agent towards state 15 as efficiently as possible while avoiding holes. Maybe prioritizing right and down actions more could help, but considering the slippery nature, I need to choose actions that have higher probabilities of moving in the desired direction without risking falling into holes.

Let me consider each state and decide which action would best increase the chances of reaching 15. For example, in state 0 (top-left), taking an action that mostly moves right or down might be better. But since it's slippery, I need to pick actions whose possible outcomes have a higher chance of moving towards 15.

Wait, but each action leads to three possibilities. So, for state 0, if the agent takes action 2 (right), then it can move right, up, or down. Moving right from 0 would take it to state 3, which is part of the top row. Alternatively, moving down from 0 goes to state 4. Considering that, perhaps action 1 (down) has a higher chance of getting closer to the goal.

Alternatively, maybe action 2 (right) is better because it moves towards state 3, which is further along the top row. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should look at each state and decide based on where it's located.

For states near the bottom or right edges, actions that push towards those directions are better. For example, in state 12 (bottom-left), taking action right (2) would help reach 13, which is moving towards 15.

Also, I should ensure that for each state, the chosen action doesn't lead into a hole when considering the possible movements. So, for states adjacent to holes, the policy must avoid actions that could cause falling into them.

Given all this, perhaps setting up a policy where in each state, the agent chooses an action that has the highest probability of moving towards 15 while avoiding dangerous moves is the way to go. 

But since I can't remember previous attempts (stateless), I need to generate a new set of params that's different from what's been tried before and might explore a path that hasn't been taken yet.

Looking at the recent policies, many have params[0] as 1 or 2. Let me try setting params[0] to 3 this time, which is up. Wait, but state 0 is top-left; moving up isn't possible. Hmm, maybe that's a bad idea because it might loop.

Alternatively, perhaps action 1 (down) for state 0 is better since it moves towards the goal row. But I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at the trajectories provided, some agents get stuck in loops or end up in holes quickly. Maybe the policy needs to be more cautious and ensure that each step doesn't lead into a hole with high probability.

I think the key is to choose actions that have higher probabilities of moving towards 15 without stepping on holes. So, for each state, I should pick an action whose possible next states don't include any holes and are closer to 15.

But since I don't know where the holes are exactly (they aren't specified), I need a general approach that avoids risky moves. Maybe moving right and down more often could help, but ensuring that each action's possibilities don't lead into a hole.

Alternatively, perhaps using a greedy approach towards 15 would work. For example, in state i, the agent chooses an action that leads to states with higher indices (closer to 15) as much as possible.

Wait, considering the grid:

0 1 2 3
4 5 6 7
8 9 10 11
12 13 14 15

So, moving right increases the state number by 1 (if on row 0), or by varying amounts otherwise. Similarly, moving down increases by 4.

So, to reach 15 quickly, perhaps moving right and down is optimal.

But given the slippery nature, each action might not take you directly in that direction. So, for example, taking action right (2) would have a chance to move up, which could lead away from the goal.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe setting all states near 15 to choose actions that directly go towards it, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: in each state, select an action that has the highest probability of leading to a state closer to 15. For example, if from state i, action A leads to states j, k, l which are all closer to 15 on average than other actions, choose action A.

But without knowing the exact hole positions, it's hard to know which actions lead to safe moves. Maybe I should just pick a policy that tries to move towards 15 as much as possible and hope that it avoids holes.

Alternatively, maybe setting up a simple policy where in each state, the agent always chooses an action that has a higher chance of moving right or down, depending on their position.

Wait, but since all actions are equally likely to go three ways, perhaps choosing an action that, on average, moves towards 15 is better. For example:

- In states not on the last row or column, prefer right and down.
- On the last row, move right as much as possible.
- On the last column, move down.

But again, due to slipperiness, this might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe a deterministic policy where each state is mapped to an action that directly points towards 15. For example:

From state i, choose an action that would take you to i+1 (right) or i+4 (down), depending on the position.

But considering the slippery nature, I'm not sure if this will work.

Alternatively, perhaps using a policy gradient method or Q-learning approach would be better, but since I have to propose params without knowing past attempts beyond what's given, it's challenging.

Given that the best reward so far is 0.45, which is below 1.0, I should focus on exploration rather than exploitation. So, try a new configuration that hasn't been tried before to gather more information about different paths.

Looking at the recent params, many have params[0] as 1 or 2. Let me try setting params[0] to 3 (up) and see if it helps. But since state 0 is top-left, moving up isn't possible—wait, no, in the grid, state 0 is at (0,0), so up would wrap around? Or is it impossible, leading to a boundary?

Wait, the environment probably has boundaries, so moving up from 0 might stay at 0 or perhaps loop? Not sure. It's safer to assume that movement out of bounds stays in place.

So, taking action 3 (up) from state 0 would have 1/3 chance to go left (state 3), down (state 4), or up (possibly staying in 0). That might not be the best strategy as it could lead to getting stuck.

Alternatively, maybe setting params[0] to 2 (right) is better. From state 0, action 2 would have a chance to go right (to 3), up (staying at 0), or down (to 4). So, 1/3 chance each. That seems reasonable.

Similarly, for other states: in state 1, which is top-middle, choosing an action that moves towards the goal.

Wait, but without knowing the hole positions, it's hard to avoid them. Maybe focusing solely on reaching 15 while avoiding loops is better.

I think I'll propose a policy where each state is set to move right or down as much as possible, considering their position in the grid. For example:

- States in the top row (0-3): prefer moving right.
- Middle rows: prefer moving down if not on the last column, else right.
- Last row: move right until reaching 15.

But I'm not sure how to translate this into the params array without knowing the exact hole locations. Also, considering the slippery nature, each action could take you in three directions, so choosing actions that have a higher chance of moving towards 15 is key.

Perhaps setting all states except those in the last row and column to move right or down, depending on their position, might help. But I'm not confident without testing.

Given that, I'll try creating a new set of params where each state chooses an action that would generally lead towards the goal. For example:

- In states 0-3 (top row), choose right (action 2) or down (action 1).
- In states 4-7 (second row), choose down (action 1) if not on the last column, else right.
- And so on.

But since I can't test this, I'll have to make an educated guess. Let me try setting params such that in each state, the action is chosen to move towards increasing the state index as much as possible.

Wait, for example:

params[0]: 2 (right)
params[1]: 2 (right)
...
But considering the grid, moving right from state 3 goes to 7, which isn't helpful. Maybe in that case, moving down is better.

Alternatively, perhaps a combination of right and down based on position.

This is getting complicated without knowing the hole positions. Perhaps I should pick a policy where each state has a mix of actions that could lead towards 15 without risking falling into holes too much.

Given all this uncertainty, I think I'll propose a new set of params that differs from previous ones, focusing on moving right and down in states not near the goal and directly towards 15 when possible.
