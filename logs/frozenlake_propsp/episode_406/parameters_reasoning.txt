You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I need to figure out the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward by reaching state 15. The environment is slippery, so each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability.

First, let me understand the problem setup. It's a 4x4 grid where states are numbered from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). The agent can move in four directions, but due to slipperiness, each action results in moving down, left, up, right, etc., with three possible outcomes.

Holes exist which end the episode if stepped on. So, the policy needs to avoid these holes while trying to reach the goal.

Looking at the provided trajectories and rewards, I notice that most policies are yielding low rewards (around 0.15 to 0.3). The global optimal is around 1.0, so we're not there yet.

The recent params tried include a lot of '2's and some '3's, but they didn't perform well. For example, the last few had f(params) as low as 0.05 or even 0.0. That suggests that current policies are either getting stuck in loops or falling into holes.

I need to think about how to structure a policy that navigates effectively without hitting holes. Let's map out potential safe paths from each state.

State 0 (top-left) should move right towards state 1, then continue moving right. However, due to slipperiness, sometimes it might go down or up. So, maybe in state 0, the best action is to move right (action 1?), but I need to check how each action translates into possible moves.

Wait, according to the problem statement:
- Action 0 leads to [down, left, up]
- Action 1 leads to [right, down, left]
- Action 2 leads to [up, right, down]
- Action 3 leads to [left, up, right]

So each action has a specific set of possible moves.

To reach the goal at state 15, starting from 0, the agent needs to move towards the east (right) and south (down). But due to slipperiness, moving right might sometimes lead elsewhere. So perhaps in certain states, it's better to encourage movement that accumulates progress towards the goal.

Looking at state 14 (which is row 3, column 2), the optimal action should be down or right to reach state 15. But due to slipperiness, maybe taking an action that can push towards those directions more often.

Similarly, in state 8 (top-left of the bottom row), moving right twice would lead to state 10 and then 12, but perhaps better to move down or right as appropriate.

I should also consider avoiding holes. From the trajectories provided, some holes are likely in certain states. For example, if a trajectory ends quickly, that might indicate a hole was encountered.

Given that the best performing policy had f(params) of 0.30, there's room for improvement. Maybe adjusting certain key states' actions to increase the probability of reaching the goal without falling into holes.

Looking at recent params:
- The most recent one had all params as 2 except the last state which was 3. But that didn't yield a good reward.
- Another tried mixing 1s, 2s, and 3s but still low rewards.

Perhaps experimenting with more varied actions to see different trajectories. For example, setting some states to move right (action 1) while others move down (action 0 or 3). Also, maybe ensuring that in certain rows, the movement is predominantly towards the east, while in columns, movement is south.

I should also note that state 15 is the goal and yields a +1 reward. So the policy must have a high probability of reaching this state without falling into holes.

Another approach: since each action leads to three possible directions, perhaps choosing actions that maximize the chance of moving towards the goal while minimizing the risk of hitting holes.

Maybe in states where it's safe to move east or south, choose actions that encourage those movements. For example, in state 0, taking an action that has a higher probability of moving right (action 1). Similarly, in state 7 (end of second row), choosing an action that can lead down towards the goal.

I think it's time to propose a new set of params, making sure they are different from previous ones and possibly tweaking some states to explore better movement patterns.
