You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right) to get a reward of +1, while avoiding holes which end the episode.

From the problem description, the environment is slippery. So when an action is taken, there's a probability spread across three possible directions. That makes things tricky because even if you choose a direction, you might not end up where you intended.

Looking at the provided top 5 best performing params, I notice that most have f(params) around 0.3 to 0.45. The global optimal should be around 1.0, so these aren't great yet. It suggests that current policies are getting close but not consistently reaching the goal.

The trajectories show that agents are sometimes moving towards state 8 (third row) or getting stuck in loops, which might mean they're hitting holes or not navigating effectively. For example, one trajectory goes from 0 to 4 and then to 8, but doesn't proceed further towards 15.

I think I need to propose a policy that avoids the known holes. From the problem statement, there are some holes in the map, but their exact positions aren't specified. So the agent should choose actions that don't lead into these holes based on previous trajectories.

In the recent attempts, all the f(params) values are 0.0, which is really low. This suggests that the agent is either falling into holes or not reaching the goal, indicating an exploration phase is needed to find better paths.

I should propose a new set of params that explores different paths. Maybe focus on moving towards state 15 by choosing actions that increase the row and column indices more effectively. For example, prioritizing right and down movements but considering the slippery nature.

But wait, since each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability, maybe choosing actions that have a higher chance of moving closer to the goal on average would be better. But I can't plan for specific paths due to being stateless and needing to maximize information gain.

So perhaps changing the policy in some states to choose different actions than before could help discover new trajectories. For example, if state 0 was previously choosing action 1, maybe try action 3 or 2 instead.

Looking at the recent params that got 0.0 reward, they had various actions but didn't reach the goal. Maybe adjusting these to take more varied steps could lead to a better path.

I need to make sure the proposed params are unique and haven't been tried before. From the top and most recent attempts, I can see some patterns in the actions taken. So I should shuffle or vary the actions across different states, especially those that seem stuck or leading towards holes.

Perhaps focusing on certain key states: like state 14 (which is one step away from the goal) should choose an action that has a high probability of moving right or down. But since it's slippery, choosing an action that can reach 15 even with some randomness.

Overall, I'll propose a new set where each state chooses an action that increases their chance of heading towards the goal while avoiding previously problematic paths.
