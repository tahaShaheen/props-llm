You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to help optimize the policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) and get a reward of +1, while avoiding holes which end the episode immediately.

First, I need to understand the setup. The grid is 4x4, with states numbered from 0 to 15. Each state corresponds to a specific cell: top row is 0-3, next row 4-7, then 8-11, and finally 12-15 at the bottom. The agent can move in four directions (left, down, right, up), but because the environment is slippery, each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability.

The policy is a function that maps each state to an action (0-3). My task is to find the optimal set of parameters (params) that maximizes the average reward over 20 episodes. The maximum number of iterations allowed is 5000, and I'm currently at iteration 431.

Looking at the provided data, the top-performing policies have rewards around 0.30 to 0.20. The most recent policies are performing worse (around 0.05 to 0.00), which suggests that maybe we're stuck in a local minimum or haven't explored enough yet.

Since I'm supposed to act as a stateless optimizer, I can't remember previous attempts. My strategy should focus on maximizing information gain. If the current rewards are far below the target (1.0), I should explore new policies by changing parameters significantly. If they're close, I should tweak the best ones slightly.

The trajectories provided show that some policies get stuck in loops or fall into holes quickly. For example, one trajectory went from state 0 to 4 multiple times without reaching the goal. This indicates that some states might have traps or lead to dead-ends if not navigated properly.

I think a good starting point is to ensure that each state's action leads towards the goal (state 15) with as much probability as possible, while avoiding holes. Since each action has three possible outcomes, I should choose actions that increase the chance of moving right or down, which would generally lead towards the goal.

Looking at the top-performing params, many have a mix of actions that seem to push towards the right and down directions. For example, in state 0 (top-left corner), action 2 (which can move up, right, or down) might be good because moving right is directly towards the goal.

However, I need to ensure that each action selected doesn't lead into a hole with high probability. The environment has some holes, but without knowing exactly where they are, I have to infer based on the trajectories provided.

One approach could be to design a policy that systematically moves towards state 15, avoiding edges where holes might be. For instance, in the first few states (0-3), encourage right or down movements. In later states, adjust to keep moving towards the goal without getting stuck.

I also need to consider that each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability, so it's crucial to choose actions that have at least one safe path towards the goal. For example, in state 15 (the goal), any action should probably stay there, but since it's already the target, maybe it doesn't matter.

Given the recent poor performance of policies, perhaps I need to try a more exploratory approach. Maybe setting some states to take different actions that haven't been tried before. For instance, in state 14 (which is just above the goal), choosing action 2 or 3 might push towards the right or down.

Another thought: since the environment is slippery and stochastic, perhaps the optimal policy requires a balance between exploration and exploitation. But since I'm acting as a stateless optimizer, each step must be an independent guess based on maximizing information.

Looking at the current best params, they have a mix of actions in each state. Maybe I should try to adjust a few key states that seem to be causing issues in recent trajectories. For example, if many trajectories are getting stuck at state 0, perhaps changing the action for state 0 could help.

Wait, in one trajectory, the agent stayed in state 0 multiple times because of action 0 or 3. Maybe choosing a different action for state 0 that leads more towards right (action 2) would be better.

Similarly, for state 15, maybe setting it to stay put or choose an action that doesn't move (but since it's the goal, perhaps any action is acceptable).

In summary, I need to propose a new set of params that:

1. Encourages movement towards the goal (right and down).
2. Avoids actions that lead into holes with high probability.
3. Changes enough from previous attempts to explore new territories but also includes tweaks based on top-performing policies.

Given that, I'll construct a new params array where each state is assigned an action that has a higher chance of moving towards the goal. For example:

- States near the top-left (0-3) should push right or down.
- Middle states (4-11) should continue moving towards the bottom-right.
- Final states (12-15) should aim to reach 15.

I'll make sure that each action has at least one move towards the goal and minimizes the risk of falling into a hole. Since I don't know the exact positions of holes, this is an educated guess based on previous trajectories.
