You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the problem is about optimizing a policy for the FrozenLake environment using a specific setup where the agent can move in four directions but has a slippery effect. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) and avoid holes.

First, I need to understand the environment better. It's a 4x4 grid, with states numbered from 0 to 15. Each state corresponds to a position on the grid. The agent can take actions (left, down, right, up), but due to slipperiness, each action has a 33% chance of moving in one of three directions.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 values, each representing the action taken from that state. My task is to propose different policies to maximize the reward, which is +1 for reaching state 15 and 0 elsewhere, except when falling into a hole, which ends the episode with no reward.

Looking at the provided information, the top five best-performing params have an average reward of around 0.45, but they're not very high. The most recent policies have lower rewards, some even zero. This suggests that the current policies aren't consistently reaching the goal or are falling into holes frequently.

The user mentioned that I should be stateless and maximize information gain by either exploring new configurations or optimizing around the best ones if close to the target reward (around 1.0). Since the current rewards are far below 1.0, it's in the exploration phase.

I need to propose a params array where each element is from [0,1,2,3], making sure not to repeat any previous configurations. The goal is to maximize information gain for the next iteration by testing new policies that might offer better rewards or reveal more about the environment's structure.

One strategy is to create policies that prioritize moving towards the goal state (state 15) as much as possible while avoiding known holes. Since the environment is slippery, it's essential to choose actions that increase the probability of reaching the goal without falling into traps.

Let me consider how each action affects the movement:

- Action 0: Can move down, left, or up.
- Action 1: Can move right, down, or left.
- Action 2: Can move up, right, or down.
- Action 3: Can move left, up, or right.

Each state needs an action that maximizes the chance of moving towards the goal while minimizing the risk of falling into a hole. For example, states near the bottom-right should have actions that push towards state 15.

Looking at the grid:

- State 0 is top-left (0,0). To get to state 15, the agent needs to move right or down.
- Action 3 from state 0 (params[0]) could be a good choice because it allows moving up, left, or right. But since we're trying to reach the goal, moving right is better. However, due to slipperiness, action 1 might also allow right movement.

Wait, no: Action 0 for state 0 includes down, left, up; action 1 includes right, down, left. So, to maximize right movement from state 0, params[0] should be set to 1 because it has a chance to move right (33%).

Similarly, for other states, I need to choose actions that have the highest probability of moving towards the goal.

For instance:

- State 15 is the goal. So, we don't care about its action since reaching it ends the episode.
- For state 14 (which is just left of 15), setting action to right (action 2 or 3) would help reach 15.
Wait, no: state 14 is in the bottom row. Its possible next states are state 15 (right), state 10 (up), and state 14 itself? Wait, need to check movement.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about how each action from each state affects the next state.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to look for existing policies that have performed well and try to tweak them or create new ones by changing some parameters.

Looking at the top-performing params:

params[0]:1; params[1]:3; params[2]:1; params[3]:3; params[4]:0; params[5]:1; params[6]:1; params[7]:2; params[8]:3; params[9]:1; params[10]:2; params[11]:3; params[12]:1; params[13]:3; params[14]:2; params[15]:3. Reward: 0.45.

This policy seems to have a mix of actions, but the reward isn't high enough. Maybe I can modify some states to push more towards the goal.

For example, let's consider state 7 (top-right in the second row). If the current action is 2, which allows up, right, or down. Moving right from state 7 leads to state 11, but that might not be optimal. Perhaps setting it to 3 would allow more chances to move right towards state 8?

Wait, no: State 7 is in row 1 (second row). So, moving right from state 7 would take you to state 8.

Alternatively, perhaps some states should have specific actions that directly target the goal direction.

Let me try to construct a new policy:

- For each state, select an action that has the highest chance of moving towards the goal. Since movement is probabilistic, we need to choose actions that include the desired direction in their possible outcomes.

For example:

- State 0 (top-left) can move right or down.
  - Action 1 allows moving right, which is good.

- State 1 (top-middle) can move left, down, or right.
  - Maybe action 3 to include up as well? No, because state 1 is top row. Up would stay in the same state. So better to go down towards state 5 or right to state 2.

Wait, no: state 1's possible moves depend on the action chosen.

Actually, each action has three possible outcomes, so choosing an action that includes movement towards the goal is key.

Let me try to define a policy where from each state, the agent chooses an action that can move towards the right or down as much as possible.

For example:

- For states in the top row (0-3), actions should encourage moving right or down.
- For states in the first column (0,4,8,12), perhaps moving right is better.

Alternatively, maybe a greedy approach where each state's action pushes towards the goal.

But given the slippery nature, it's tricky. Perhaps using a policy that tends to move right and down more often would help.

Looking at the current top policies, they have varying actions, but none reach high rewards. So perhaps I need to create a new policy that changes several parameters to push more towards the goal.

Alternatively, maybe setting all states to action 2 or 3 could increase the chances of moving right and up/down, which might help navigate towards state 15.

But without knowing where the holes are exactly, it's hard to craft the perfect policy. However, since we need to avoid falling into holes based on previous trajectories, perhaps the current policies have been getting stuck or falling into holes because their actions aren't optimal.

Given that, maybe changing some of the key states' actions could lead to better rewards.

Let me try creating a new params array:

- For state 0: action 1 (right is possible)
- State 1: action 3 (can move left, up, or right; but in top row, up stays same. So maybe better to go right)
- State 2: action 2 (up, right, down). From state 2, moving right goes to state 6, which is not optimal. Maybe better to choose action 3 for state 2.
- Wait, no. Let me think about each state.

This might take too long, but I need to propose a new params configuration that's different from previous ones and could lead to higher rewards.

Perhaps flipping some actions in critical states:

For example, changing the action for state 7 (which is currently 2) to action 3. Or maybe setting more states towards action 1 or 3 to encourage rightward movement.

Alternatively, perhaps setting most states to action 2 and 3, which have right movements.

Given that, let me propose a new params where:

- For each state, choose the action that includes moving right if possible, otherwise down.

Looking at each state's position:

State 0: (0,0) - can move right or down. Action 1 allows right.
So set params[0] = 1.

State 1: (0,1) - can move left, down, or right. Action 3 includes right and up (but up is same state). So maybe action 3 to allow right movement.

Wait, no: action 3 for state 1 allows moving left, up, or right. But since we're in the top row, up doesn't change the state. So choosing action 3 could help move right.

Similarly:

State 2: (0,2) - can move up, down, or right via action 2 or 3.

But perhaps it's better to set params[2] = 3 to include right movement.

Continuing this way for all states might be time-consuming, but I think the main idea is to push towards the goal by selecting actions that have a chance of moving right or down.

Alternatively, maybe setting all even-numbered states to action 1 and odd to action 3, but that's just a guess.

Wait, let me try creating a specific example:

params[0] = 1 (right)
params[1] = 3 (left/up/right) – but in top row, up stays same. So better to move right.
Wait, action 3 for state 1 allows moving left, up, or right.

But maybe action 1 is better because it can move down or right as well?

No, action 1 for state 1 includes right (good), down (better than staying), and left (bad). So perhaps action 1 is better.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should just propose a new params configuration that's different from previous ones but strategically changes some actions to push towards the goal more.

Looking at the most recent params provided:

params[0]:3; others vary. Reward was 0.00.

Another one had params[0]=1, and some other states changed. But reward was low.

So perhaps I need a new approach. Maybe set all states to action that allows right or down movement.

Alternatively, considering the grid, the optimal path is likely moving right as much as possible until the last column, then down.

But due to slipperiness, it's better to have actions that increase the chance of moving towards the goal.

In that case, for each state not in the last column or row, set action to 1 (which allows right and down), but I need to check what each action does.

Wait, action 1 allows right, down, left. So from state 0, choosing action 1 gives a chance to move right (good) or down (also towards goal).

Similarly, for states in the top row, except the last column, setting action to 3 might allow moving right as well as up/down.

Alternatively, perhaps using a policy that tends to move right and down.

But without knowing where the holes are, it's hard to balance. However, since the user mentioned that we should avoid holes based on previous trajectories, maybe the current policies are failing because they're not avoiding certain states.

Given that, perhaps changing some actions in key positions can help avoid holes while still moving towards the goal.

In conclusion, I'll propose a new params configuration where most states are set to action 1 or 3, focusing on right and down movements.
