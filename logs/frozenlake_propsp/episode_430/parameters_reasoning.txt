You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment to maximize the reward. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner), which gives a +1 reward, while avoiding holes that end the episode with 0.

First, let me understand the setup. It's a 4x4 grid, states numbered 0 to 15 from top-left to bottom-right. The environment is slippery, meaning each action has three possible outcomes with equal probability. So for example, moving right might take you up, down, or stay in place.

Looking at the problem statement, I need to create a policy where each state (from 0 to 15) maps to an action (0-3). The challenge is to find the optimal set of actions that maximizes the average reward over 20 episodes.

From the top 6 best-performing params, it seems like policies with certain patterns perform better. For instance, some have higher rewards around 0.3, but none are close to 1.0 yet. The most recent five params all have low rewards (around 0.05 or less), which suggests that the current strategies aren't very effective.

Since the environment is slippery and there are holes, I need a policy that avoids these holes by learning from previous trajectories. The agent should take actions that minimize the chance of falling into a hole while increasing the probability of reaching state 15.

I notice in the recent trials that some policies get stuck in loops or don't progress towards the goal effectively. For example, one trajectory went (0,3) to various states but didn't reach 15. Another stayed at 0 for many steps before moving elsewhere.

To improve, I should consider a policy where each state directs the agent towards the goal with actions that have higher chances of leading towards it, considering the slipperiness. Maybe prioritizing right and down movements from upper rows to move closer to state 15.

Looking at state transitions: To get to state 15 (bottom-right), the agent should ideally be moving right or down as much as possible from states in earlier rows and columns.

Given that actions have three possible outcomes, I need to choose for each state an action that has the highest probability of eventually leading towards the goal without hitting a hole.

Let me outline possible strategies:

1. From the top-left (state 0), moving right or down could be beneficial.
2. For states in the first row, moving right is crucial to progress towards the goal.
3. States in the last column should focus on moving down until reaching state 15.
4. Avoid actions that lead into known holes; perhaps learn which states are dangerous based on prior trajectories.

But wait, without knowing where the holes are exactly, I need a general approach. Maybe from certain states, choosing an action that maximizes the chance of staying within safe zones while moving towards the goal.

Looking at previous policies, some have params set to 2 or 3 for various states. For example, state 0 might be better off with action 1 (right) since it's in the top row and needs to move right.

But considering the slipperiness: choosing an action that has a higher probability of moving towards the goal despite possible slips. So maybe from state 0, choosing action 3 or 2 could be better because they allow multiple movement options.

Alternatively, perhaps using Q-learning principles here by selecting actions with highest expected rewards, but since I can't remember previous attempts (stateless), each suggestion needs to stand on its own.

Given that the recent policies have low rewards, maybe suggesting a more aggressive policy that pushes towards the goal with higher probability despite the slipperiness. For example, setting as many states as possible to move right or down.

I think I should propose a policy where most states in upper rows choose right (action 1) and middle rows choose down (action 0), while states on the last column go down towards 15.

But without knowing hole positions, it's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps setting all states to action 3 except for certain ones. Action 3 allows movement left, up, or right—so more versatile in avoiding holes but might not push directly towards the goal.

Alternatively, maybe a combination: upper rows use right actions, middle rows use down actions, and last column uses down.

But given that each action has three possible outcomes, perhaps I should set for each state an action that offers multiple paths towards the goal while minimizing hole risk.

Given all this confusion, perhaps it's best to suggest a policy where states in the first row (0-3) choose right, second and third rows choose down, and last row chooses right or down. Let me try mapping that.

Wait, no—states are 0-15. Let me map the grid:

Row 0: 0(0,0), 1(0,1), 2(0,2), 3(0,3)
Row 1:4(1,0),5(1,1),6(1,2),7(1,3)
Row 2:8(2,0),9(2,1),10(2,2),11(2,3)
Row 3:12(3,0),13(3,1),14(3,2),15(3,3)

So to get from any state to the goal, right or down is needed depending on position.

For example:

- From 0 (top-left): moving right (action 1) could take it towards 1.
- From 1: moving right would go to 2.
- ...
But considering slips, maybe choosing actions that have a higher chance of moving in the desired direction.

Alternatively, since all actions are slippery, perhaps setting for each state an action that increases the likelihood of eventually getting to the goal. Maybe using a combination of directions.

Given that I need to propose params without prior knowledge, and ensuring they haven't been tried before, I'll try to create a new set.

Looking back at previous params, many had certain patterns. For example, some used 2 or 3 for multiple states.

Let me attempt a policy where in the first row (0-3), actions are right; second row (4-7) down; third row (8-11) right again to move towards higher columns; and last row (12-15) right except 15 which stays.

But considering slips, this might not be efficient. Alternatively, perhaps setting all states to action 3, which allows moving in multiple directions.

Wait, but I need to avoid holes as well. Without knowing where the holes are, it's hard to design a policy around them.

Given that, maybe a safe approach is to have each state choose an action that has the highest chance of not leading into a hole, while still progressing towards the goal.

Alternatively, perhaps set all states to action 3 (which allows left, up, right) except for certain key states. But this might be too vague.

Given the time constraints and the need to propose a new policy each time without memory, I'll try to vary the actions across different states to explore new possibilities.

Perhaps setting some states to move down, others to move right, and others to move up or left, trying to find a balance that avoids holes while progressing towards the goal.

After considering all this, here's an attempt at a new policy:

- For row 0 (states 0-3): action 1 (right)
- For row 1 (4-7): action 0 (down)
- For row 2 (8-11): action 1 (right)
- For row 3 (12-15): action 0 (down)

This way, the agent moves right in even rows and down in odd rows, trying to navigate towards the goal.

But I'm not sure if this will hit holes. Maybe adjusting some states where moving differently could avoid known holes.

Alternatively, perhaps using a more cautious approach with some up or left actions to backtrack if necessary.

Wait, but without knowing where the holes are, it's difficult. So maybe a better approach is to have each state choose an action that offers multiple paths towards the goal while not getting stuck.

In conclusion, I'll propose a policy where most states in upper rows move right and middle rows move down, with some adjustments in lower rows to reach the goal.
