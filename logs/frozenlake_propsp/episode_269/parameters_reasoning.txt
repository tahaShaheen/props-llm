You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment with the given conditions. Let me start by understanding the problem.

First, the environment is a 4x4 grid called FrozenLake. The agent can move in four directions: down, right, up, or left. But each action has equal probability when an action is taken, except when specified otherwise. For example, taking action 0 (down) gives equal chance among move down, left, and up.

The goal is to reach state 15, which is the bottom-right corner. Each non-goal state gives 0 reward, and the goal state gives +1 reward. There are some holes that can cause the game to end if the agent steps on them, so I need to explore through these holes by reading previous trajectories.

The policy is a function represented as an array of 16 values. Each value corresponds to the action (0-3) when in state i. The initial params are all set to 1, and I need to find values from [0,1,2,3] for each action. My goal is to reach the goal with high probability.

Looking at the examples provided, some policies have higher rewards like 1.0 or 0.35, which suggests that adjusting params can lead to better performance. But since I'm supposed to find the global optimal policy, maybe there's a specific set of parameters that consistently leads to the highest reward across different trials.

I remember that in such environments, policies often involve prioritizing certain states first. For instance, reaching the goal quickly is crucial. Maybe an action like 'up' when near the right side of the grid would help avoid falling into holes.

But I also need to consider that some actions might lead into traps or make it harder to reach the goal. So I have to balance between exploring different paths and exploiting the ones that seem promising.

Another approach is to model this as a reinforcement learning problem where the agent learns the optimal policy through trial and error. But since all parameters are discrete, maybe there's a pattern or known optimal set from prior knowledge.

I also need to think about the reward function. The agent gets +1 only when it reaches state 15. So I want policies that guide the agent directly towards 15 without getting stuck in bad states.

Looking at the examples, some policies have parameters that encourage moving up or left more when near certain areas. For example, params[0] is 2, which makes action 0 (down) happen 3 out of 4 times. That might help avoid falling into holes by sometimes taking a different path.

I think I should experiment with values where the actions are balanced. Maybe using 1 for all actions except when near the goal, and 2 or 3 to handle tricky states. But without specific data on which parameters work best, it's hard to decide exactly.

Perhaps I can try setting some actions higher probability to avoid traps. For example, action 0 (down) with a higher chance could help reach the top right, while action 3 (left) might be better for lower rows.

But without more trials, it's risky to guess. Maybe I should try a few different parameter combinations, like setting params[2] = 1 and others as needed, and see which leads to higher rewards.
