You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy parameters for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get a reward of 1 by reaching state 15 without falling into any holes. The environment is slippery, which means each action leads to one of three possible moves with equal probability.

Looking at the provided information, the top-performing policies have rewards around 0.25-0.45, which is lower than the optimal goal of 1.0. That suggests that there's room for improvement in the current strategies.

The recent parameters tried all resulted in very low rewards, even zero, so I should focus on exploration to find new configurations that might lead closer to the optimal reward. Since the agent is stateless and can't remember previous attempts, each suggestion must be unique and aim to maximize information gain about which paths are safe and lead towards the goal.

I need to think about how each state's action choice affects the possible transitions. For example, in state 0 (top-left corner), choosing an action that moves right or down might be better because moving up would stay in the same state, and left isn't possible as it's the edge. But considering the slippery nature, I should choose actions that have a higher chance of moving towards the goal.

Looking at the top trajectories, some went into loops or fell into holes. So, perhaps adjusting certain states' actions to avoid risky moves could help. For instance, if a policy leads the agent to stay in state 0 repeatedly, changing the action for state 0 might break that loop and move it towards other parts of the grid.

I should try varying some parameters from their previous values. Maybe setting different actions for key states like 0, 3, 4, etc., where being stuck is common. For example, if previously in state 0, action 1 was chosen, maybe switching to action 2 could push the agent down more often.

Another approach is to ensure that each state's action choice leads towards a direction that has a higher chance of reaching the goal or avoiding known holes. Since I don't have information about which states are holes, but based on trajectories, certain paths lead to failure, so perhaps steering clear of those directions in critical states would help.

I should propose a new set of parameters where each state's action is chosen to move towards the right or down more often, as these directions generally lead closer to the goal (state 15). For example:

- params[0]: 2 (action 2 might push it down)
- params[1]: 3 (could move right)
- params[4]: 2 (down again from state 4)
- params[8]: 3 (right from state 8)

But I also need to consider the slippery nature, so each action should have a mix of directions that don't trap the agent. Maybe testing a parameter set where key states push towards the goal in different ways.

After considering all this, I'll propose a new set of params that vary from previous attempts, focusing on moving towards the goal while avoiding potential loops and holes.
