You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out the best next step for the FrozenLake environment problem. The goal is to find a global optimal policy that maximizes the reward, which should be around 1.0. So far, all the policies tried have given very low rewards (around 0.15 or less), which suggests that we're not getting close to the goal state 15 consistently.

Looking at the previous params and their trajectories, it seems like most of them are either getting stuck in loops or falling into holes quickly. For example, some policies keep moving left or right without making progress towards the goal, while others end up stepping on holes immediately.

I need to think about how each state's action affects the agent's path. Since the environment is slippery, each action leads to one of three possible moves with equal probability. To maximize the chance of reaching 15, the policy should guide the agent towards it as much as possible while avoiding the holes.

Let me consider state 0 (top-left corner). If the agent takes action 0, it can move down, left, or up. But since the goal is at 15 (bottom-right), moving right might be better. However, in the given params, some have action 1 for state 0, which allows movement to the right with probability 1/3.

Wait, but the slippery nature means that even choosing an action doesn't guarantee movement in that direction. So maybe setting each state's action to push towards the goal direction as much as possible is a good idea.

For example:
- From state 0 (top-left), moving right or down would help progress towards the goal.
- From state 1 (top-middle), moving right or down again.
- Similarly, for other states, the actions should be set to move towards the right or down when possible.

But I also need to avoid holes. The holes are probably in certain positions, but since I don't have their exact locations, I have to infer based on previous trajectories where the agent fell into them.

Looking at the top-performing params, many had action 1 for state 0, which includes moving right with a third probability. Maybe that's why some managed to get further than others. However, since all rewards are low, perhaps the policy is still not optimal.

I think I should propose a new set of params where each state's action is designed to push towards the goal direction, considering the possible slippery movements. For instance:
- States in the top row (0-3) could have actions that encourage moving right or down.
- Middle rows might focus on moving right and down as well.
- The bottom-right states should be set to stay there once reached.

But since I can't remember previous attempts, I need to ensure each new params is unique. From the buffer, some patterns repeat, so I should vary the actions more.

Perhaps setting state 0's action to 2 (which includes moving up, right, or down). That way, the agent has a chance to move right towards the goal. Similarly, other states could have their actions adjusted accordingly.

Wait, but the previous attempts had many params with similar structures, so I should try something different this time. Maybe assign each state an action that maximizes the probability of moving towards the goal without getting stuck or falling into holes.

Alternatively, considering that all previous policies are underperforming, maybe a more aggressive approach is needed, such as sending the agent directly towards the right and down, regardless of the slippery nature.

I think the key is to have each state's action push towards the goal direction. So for states in the top row, actions should be 0 (down) or 1 (right/down/left). Wait, but the possible moves from an action are fixed.

Let me map out the best possible actions:

- State 0: action 1 allows right, down, left. Since moving right is towards the goal.
- State 1: action 3 allows left, up, right. Maybe action 2 to include right and down?
Wait, no—action 2 for state 1 would be move up, right, or down.

Hmm, perhaps I need a more systematic approach. For each state, determine which actions have the highest chance of moving towards the goal without stepping into holes. Since I don't know where the holes are, I have to make educated guesses based on previous trajectories.

Given that many policies ended quickly in the buffer, maybe the holes are positioned such that certain moves lead directly into them. Therefore, it's safer to choose actions that avoid known dangerous moves.

For example, if state 0 has action 1, which allows right movement with a third chance, and some agents managed to move towards the goal, perhaps increasing the probability of moving in the desired direction by selecting an action that includes more right or down movements would help.

In conclusion, I'll propose a new set of params where each state's action is chosen to encourage movement towards the goal, considering the slippery nature and avoiding previously tried configurations as much as possible.
