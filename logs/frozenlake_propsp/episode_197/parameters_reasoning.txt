You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The problem states that the agent is in a slippery environment, which means when it takes an action, there's a 2/3 chance it'll go in one direction and 1/6 each for the other two. My goal is to find parameters (params) such that the episodic reward f(params) is maximized.

First, I need to understand how the policy works. Each state has an action that corresponds to params[i], where i is the index of the state in a grid from 0 to 15. The actions are 0-3, and each action has certain probabilities based on the current params.

Looking at the problem statement, I see that when the agent takes an action, it doesn't always choose one specific action. For example, taking action 0 leads to moving down, left, or up with equal probability (each 1/3). Similarly, action 1 has right, down, left each 1/3. Action 2 is up, right, down, so each 1/3, and action 3 is left, up, right.

Wait a minute, that's not what I thought initially. The problem says when the agent takes action i, it picks from three directions with equal probability. So for each action, there are two other actions besides the one chosen, leading to 1 - p where p is the chance of picking the specific action.

So, let me list out all possible transitions based on the policies given in the examples:

For params = [2,0,3,2,...] (the first top performer), each action i has a probability distribution. For example, for action 1, the agent picks right with 2/3 and down/left each 1/6.

I think the key here is to find a policy that maximizes expected rewards while avoiding stepping on the holes in the map. Since the problem mentions some states (holes) will end the game unless the agent steps onto them, I need policies that avoid these areas as much as possible.

But how do I translate this into parameter choices? Each action choice affects the transition probabilities, which influence the expected reward.

I remember that for small environments like 4x4 grids, it's feasible to try all combinations of parameters. Since params[i] can be 0-3 and there are 16 states (from 0 to 15), each with its own action, that would make 4^16 possible parameter combinations, which is way too many to check manually.

But the user suggested focusing on a few top-performing parameters. The examples provided have certain patterns:

Looking at the first example:
params[0]:2, params[1]:0, etc.
This policy seems to avoid some dangerous areas and prioritize safe moves.

The second example with [0:2, 1:3] might be taking right more often when on specific states. The third has a mix of left, up, and down at the top-left (params[0],1,2). Maybe this avoids falling into holes by staying in higher-value areas.

I think the best approach is to try parameter combinations that balance exploration and exploitation while avoiding dangerous paths. Maybe starting with policies that are more deterministic (like always take action 2 or 3) and then mixing them with stochastic ones could help.

Since it's a 4x4 grid, I'll focus on the top rows and see how parameters affect actions in those areas. For example, keeping params[0] as high as possible might avoid falling into the hole at state 15 (bottom right). So perhaps params[0]=2 or 3 is better.

I need to choose a few parameter sets from these examples and test them. Maybe try [2:1, 0:2, 3:1], which seems to prioritize avoiding dangerous areas by preferring action 2 in the top-left (params[0] = 2, params[1]=0), perhaps? Wait, no, in the first example, params[0] is 2. So when on state 0, it picks actions 1,3, or 2 with equal probability.

Wait, but state 0's action would be action 2 (params[0] = 2) because for state 0, choosing between up, right, down. Since action 1 is to the right and has a higher reward, maybe it prefers that more often? Or perhaps not necessarily.

I think I should try several parameter combinations from the top performers mentioned in the problem's examples and see which one gives the highest reward without stepping on the holes too often. This way, the agent doesn't get stuck there but can still reach the goal state 15 with maximum possible rewards.
