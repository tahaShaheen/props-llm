You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get an average reward close to 1.0, which means successfully reaching state 15 most of the time without falling into any holes.

Looking at the problem, it's a 4x4 grid with slippery movement. Each action has three possible outcomes with equal probability. Holes are present, and stepping on them ends the episode immediately. The policy needs to be optimized over 5000 iterations, but I'm currently at iteration 628.

From the history provided, the top-performing policies have rewards around 0.30, which is significantly below the target of 1.0. This suggests that we're still in the exploration phase since the rewards are far from optimal. So, according to the stateless strategy, I should act as an "Explorer" and try new configurations rather than tweaking existing ones.

The trajectories provided show that some policies are getting stuck or not reaching the goal efficiently. For example, one trajectory goes (0,1) → (4,2) → (8,2), which might be leading towards state 15 but hasn't reached it yet. Another gets stuck in a loop near state 4.

I need to design a policy that avoids holes and increases the chances of reaching state 15. Let's think about each state:

- State 0 is the top-left corner. From here, moving right or down could help move towards the goal, but considering the slippery nature, it's better to choose an action that has multiple safe paths.

Looking at previous policies, some have used action 2 (up) for state 0, which might not be ideal because from state 0, up would keep it in the same place. Alternatively, action 1 or 3 could be better as they provide more movement options.

I should consider creating a policy that encourages moving towards the right and down directions since those are towards the goal. However, due to the slippery nature, each action has a 1/3 chance of three possible moves, so I need to ensure that even with the randomness, there's a path towards state 15.

Perhaps setting most states to move right or down would help. Let me try to create such a policy without repeating any previous configurations.

After considering, I decide to set each state's action to either right (action 3) or down (action 0). For example:

- Even-numbered states might be better with action 1 or 2.
Wait, no—let me think again. Each action from a given state leads to three possible moves. So for each state, I need an action that maximizes the probability of moving towards the goal while avoiding holes.

Looking at some example states:

- State 0: Possible actions are down, left, up when choosing action 0; right, down, left with action 1; etc. Choosing action 3 (right) would have a chance to move right or possibly other directions.
Similarly for other states.

I'll need to assign actions in such a way that each state encourages movement towards the goal. Maybe setting most states to action 3 (right) when possible, but adjusting based on their position.

But since I can't remember previous attempts beyond what's provided, and I need to avoid repeating params, I have to come up with a new configuration.

I think choosing actions that generally push towards the right or down would be beneficial. Let me try setting each state to action 3 (right) if possible, but adjusting for edge cases where moving right isn't an option.

Wait, no—each state's movement is based on its row and column. For example, in state 0 (top-left), moving right takes it to state 1, down to state 4, etc. So setting action 3 (right) would have a chance to move the agent right or other directions.

Alternatively, maybe setting states near the edges to specific actions to prevent falling into holes.

But without knowing where the holes are exactly, I need a general approach. Perhaps the optimal policy is one that systematically navigates towards the goal with minimal risk of falling into holes.

Given all this, I'll create a new params array where each state is assigned an action that tends to move towards the right or down, considering their positions, while avoiding any configuration previously seen.
