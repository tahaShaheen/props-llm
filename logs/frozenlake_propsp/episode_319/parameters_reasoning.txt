You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) and get a reward of +1, while avoiding the holes which end the episode immediately.

First, I need to understand how the slippery actions work. Each action taken by the agent results in three possible moves with equal probability. For example, taking action 0 can move down, left, or up. This makes the environment stochastic, so the same action might lead to different states.

I know that the best possible reward is around 1.0, which means the agent should reliably reach state 15 without falling into any holes. The current policies provided have rewards between 0.10 and 0.25, which are much lower than optimal. So I'm in the exploration phase since the rewards aren't close to 1.0.

Looking at the most recent params, many of them choose action 3 for various states. Action 3 has a mix of left, up, and right movements. Maybe this leads towards state 15 but also risks falling into holes because it's not directly moving towards the goal in a straight line.

I think I need to adjust some policies to move more deterministically towards the goal. For instance, from state 0 (top-left), moving right or down could be better. But considering the slippery nature, maybe choosing an action that generally moves downward or right would increase the chance of reaching state 15.

Looking at state 0, currently, some policies suggest action 2, which allows up, right, and down. But since we're at the top-left, moving up isn't helpful. So perhaps action 1 or 3 might be better as they include right and down movements.

I should also ensure that from states near the goal, like state 14 (second row, third column), the agent takes actions that can reach state 15. For example, state 14 is one move to the right of the bottom-right corner, so taking an action that includes moving right would be ideal.

Another consideration is avoiding holes. The environment has some holes that aren't specified, but from the trajectories, I can infer which states are dangerous. For example, if the agent gets stuck in a loop or keeps moving away from the goal, it's likely falling into a hole or not making progress.

I think a good strategy might be to have policies that push the agent towards state 15 as much as possible, using actions that generally move downward or right. I'll go through each state and decide which action (0-3) would best increase the chances of reaching the goal without getting stuck.

For example:
- State 0: Move right (action 1 allows right, down, left). Since right is towards the goal.
- State 1: Maybe move down (action 0 or 3). Down takes it closer to state 5, which is in the next row.
- State 2: Action that moves down or right.
- And so on for each state.

But since each action leads to three possible directions, I need to choose actions that maximize the probability of moving towards the goal. This might involve selecting actions that have a higher chance of moving in the desired direction, given the environment's slippery nature.

After considering all states and their possible transitions, I'll outline a new set of params that guides the agent more effectively towards state 15 while avoiding loops or holes.
