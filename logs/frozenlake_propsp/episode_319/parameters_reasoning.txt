You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to find the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment using a Q-learning approach with parameterized action values. The goal is to reach state 15, which is the right bottom grid, and all other states give a reward of 0. However, some grids are considered holes that can lead to failure if stepped on.

The policy parameters (params[0] to params[14]) determine which action (0-3) to take from each state. Each param represents an action when in the corresponding top grid (state i). The agent's exploration is guided by these parameters, but I need to ensure that it doesn't explore previously seen states again.

From the provided examples, several different sets of params have varying values for each action. For instance, some set params[0] and [1] to 2, others use a mix of 0,1,2,3 across multiple actions. The goal is to find a parameter configuration that maximizes the expected reward over time.

Since the environment is slippery, each action has an equal probability of leading in two (or three) directions when taken. This means the agent's exploration isn't biased towards any particular action but should instead explore all possibilities based on the current policy.

The most recent example shows a scenario where params[0] to [3] are varied widely across 1 and 2, which might lead the agent into areas it hasn't explored yet. The highest reward (1.00) was achieved in some specific parameter configurations, possibly those that encourage exploration towards the goal without stepping on holes.

To find the optimal policy, I should run multiple trials with different param values, perhaps using a grid search or random sampling across [0,1,2,3] for each action. Since 4 actions have 4 options each, there are 4^4 = 256 possible parameter sets to explore. However, this might be computationally intensive.

Another approach is to use an optimization method like gradient descent, adjusting the parameters based on the observed rewards and transitions in the environment. But without a specific reward function or transition model, it's challenging to apply these methods directly.

Given that the user wants a single optimal set of parameters (params), I'll need to run several trials with different parameter combinations and select the one that gives the highest average reward across iterations. It might take multiple runs since some configurations could be better but others might not explore certain paths effectively.

Looking at the examples, there's a configuration where params[0] is 2, which leads to moving up (action 2) from state 0, then right (action1) and so on. This pattern seems like it's trying to find the shortest path towards the goal. However, other configurations also achieve good rewards by sometimes taking different actions but not necessarily following the optimal path.

I think the best approach is to test several parameter sets, perhaps using a combination of 0s and 2s for certain states as in one example, and see which yields the highest average reward over time.
