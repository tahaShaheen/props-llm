You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help this agent find the best policy in the FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15, which is the bottom right corner, and get a reward of +1 for each other state. There are some holes where stepping on them ends the game, but the agent should explore through those by reading history.

The policy is represented as an array of parameters [params[0], params[1], ..., params[15]], each corresponding to actions when in states 0 through 15. Each action can be 0 (down), 1 (right/down/left), 2 (up, right, down), or 3 (left, up, right). The values of these params are chosen from [0,1,2,3], but only the top 4 are shown here.

From what I understand, each parameter represents a different action when in their respective state. For example, params[0] is the action to take for state 0. Since action 2 (up) has higher priority because it includes up, left, and down, choosing action 2 would give more weight to those options.

Looking at the provided best performing parameters:
- params[0]: 1; action is 3: which means left, up, or right.
- params[1]: 0; action is 2.
And so on. 

But wait, I need to make sure that for each state i (from 0 to 15), the corresponding action is chosen correctly. So for example, if params[i] = 3, then in state i, the agent should take action 3.

I also recall that the value function f(params) represents the episodic reward starting from state i with policy params. The goal is to maximize this value across all states.

So, the plan is:
1. Choose parameters [params[0], params[1], ..., params[15]] such that for each state, the action selected is the one with the highest expected return.
2. For each state, find out which action (from 0 to 3) gives the maximum reward considering transitions and rewards from subsequent states.

I should probably iterate through each parameter, ensuring that in their respective states, the agent takes the best possible action based on their chosen value. Since higher parameters might have different behaviors, I'll need to simulate or compute which actions yield better expected returns.

Wait, but without knowing the exact transition probabilities and rewards for each state, it's a bit tricky. However, given that when an action is taken, if the agent takes one of the 3 directions with equal probability (as per the problem statement), I can model this probabilistically in my simulations.

I think the key here is to select params such that for each state i, the chosen action is the best possible according to the current parameters. This means checking, for each state, what's the maximum expected reward obtainable by choosing any of the four actions (0-3), and then selecting the one with the highest value.

But without knowing the exact transition probabilities or the immediate rewards, it's a bit vague. The provided best parameters already seem to follow this principle, but maybe I should try other combinations.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the agent's exploration strategy: when the agent steps into a hole (state where 15 is not reachable), it reads history and picks actions that don't lead back to such states. So, in those cases, the policy must be robust enough to avoid revisiting holes by choosing actions that explore new paths.

But without detailed information on which transitions lead to holes or how rewards are affected, I might need to focus more on maximizing the expected reward through various action sequences guided by the chosen params.

In summary, my approach is:
- For each state i (0-15), choose an action based on the parameter value. The action chosen for each state should be the one that maximizes the expected episodic reward starting from that state.
- Since the agent can explore into holes, I need to ensure that the policy allows it to reach states without holes by choosing actions that are safe or have better returns.

So, when preparing the params array, each index corresponds to a state, and the value at each index determines which action is taken for that state. The goal is to select these values such that the sum of rewards from each state following the policy maximizes the total reward across all states.
