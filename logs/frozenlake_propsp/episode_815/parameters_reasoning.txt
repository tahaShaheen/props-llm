You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, let's try to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. So, from what I understand, it's a 4x4 grid where each state is represented by numbers 0 to 15. The goal is to reach state 15, which gives a reward of +1, and all other states give 0 except for the holes, which end the episode with no reward.

The environment is slippery, meaning that when you take an action, there's a 33% chance to move in one of three directions. The actions are mapped as follows:
- Action 0: down, left, up
- Action 1: right, down, left
- Action 2: up, right, down
- Action 3: left, up, right

The policy is defined by an array of 16 numbers (params), each corresponding to a state and indicating the action to take. The challenge is to find the optimal set of actions that maximizes the average reward over multiple episodes.

Looking at the previous examples and trajectories provided, it seems that most policies are getting around 0.35 to 0.45 average rewards, which is below 1.0, the target. So, as an "Explorer," I need to propose a new set of params that hasn't been tried before and might help discover better paths or avoid holes.

I notice that in some trajectories, agents get stuck in loops or fall into holes because their policies aren't guiding them effectively towards the goal while avoiding dangers. For example, one trajectory went from state 0 to 1, then to 4, which is the second row's first column. But since it didn't reach the goal, maybe changing some actions could help.

I should consider states near the goal and ensure that their actions are likely to move towards state 15. For instance, state 12 (bottom left) should probably move right or up, but given the slipperiness, the policy needs to account for possible drifts.

Also, looking at the holes, perhaps some states in the middle rows (like 4-7 and 8-11) need careful handling. If the agent is in state 5, which is (0,1), moving right might take it closer, but with the slippery nature, it could end up elsewhere.

I think a good strategy would be to set actions for each state that pushes the agent towards the bottom-right corner as much as possible, considering the probabilities. For example, in state 0 (top-left), choosing action 2 (up, right, down) might help move towards either up or right, but since up is out of bounds, it could go to the same spot or right.

Wait, actually, in state 0, moving up isn't possible, so the effective moves would be right and down. But with the slipperiness, choosing actions that have a higher chance to move towards the goal might be better.

I'll try to construct a policy where each state's action is chosen to maximize the probability of reaching the goal without stepping into holes. For example, in states closer to the goal, the policy should encourage right and down movements, while in other areas, it should navigate around known holes.

Given that, I'll start by setting actions for key positions:
- State 12 (bottom-left): move right or up. Since moving up would keep it in the same row but towards the right.
- State 13: move right to reach state 14, then from there, move down to reach 15.

But considering the slippery nature, I need to choose actions that have a higher chance of leading towards the goal despite possible drifts. So, perhaps setting action 2 for certain states and action 3 for others.

After thinking through, here's a proposed params array where each state is assigned an action that likely pushes towards the goal or avoids holes.
