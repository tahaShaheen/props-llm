You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 847 out of 5000. OUTPUT ONLY THIS SINGLE LINE:

Do NOT output anything else. No explanation, no reasoning, nothing.



LLM:
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out the best parameters for the FrozenLake environment to maximize the reward. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right corner) and avoid holes. 

From the information given, the environment is slippery, meaning each action has a 33% chance of going in three possible directions. So, the agent's path isn't deterministic; it depends on probabilities.

Looking at the previous top-performing parameters, most have an average reward around 0.45, which is below the target of 1.0. This suggests that we need to explore more rather than exploit the current best policies because we're not close to the optimal reward yet.

I notice that some trajectories end quickly by falling into holes or reaching the goal. For example, one trajectory went from state 0 (top-left) to state 4 (second row, first column), then to 8, and so on. This might mean that certain actions are leading directly towards the goal but could also be risky if they pass through holes.

Since we're in an exploration phase (rewards are low), I should propose a parameter set that hasn't been tried before. Looking at the recent params, many have specific patterns. To maximize information gain, I'll try varying some of these parameters significantly.

Let me think about each state and what action would help avoid holes while moving towards the goal. For instance, in state 0 (top-left), taking action 1 could move down or right, but considering slipperiness, it might be safer to choose an action that has a higher probability of avoiding the hole below.

I'll propose changing some key states:

- params[0]: Maybe set to 2 instead of previous common values. This would allow moving up, right, or down with equal chance.
- For state 15 (goal), it's already done, so action doesn't matter, but keeping it as a safe choice like 3 could be good.

I need to ensure that the new parameters are different from all previously seen ones and cover various states to gather more data on which actions lead to success or failure.
