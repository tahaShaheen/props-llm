You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the best possible policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me start by understanding the problem thoroughly.

The environment is a 4x4 grid where each state corresponds to a specific cell (like state 0 is top-left, 15 is bottom-right). The agent can move in four directions, but because it's slippery, each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability. My goal is to find the policy that maximizes the average reward, which should ideally be around 1.0 if the agent always reaches state 15 without falling into any holes.

Looking at the provided data, the top-performing policies have an average reward of about 0.30, but we want to reach closer to 1.0. The recent attempts seem to be getting zero rewards, which suggests that those policies are either not reaching the goal or are hitting holes consistently.

I need to think about how the agent can navigate safely to state 15 without falling into any holes. Since each action has a probability of moving in three directions, the policy must account for these probabilities and choose actions that statistically lead towards the goal while avoiding dangerous states.

From the trajectories provided, some policies are getting stuck or falling into loops. For example, one trajectory keeps looping between state 0 and others without making progress. This indicates that certain action choices might be leading to dead-ends or areas with holes.

I should consider a policy that encourages moving towards the goal (right and down directions) as much as possible. Since each action has three possible outcomes, choosing actions that have right and down in their possible moves would increase the chances of making progress towards state 15.

Looking at the previous top policies, many choose action 2 or 3 for states near the start. Action 2 (move up, right, down) might be better early on to allow upward movement if needed but mostly push towards right and down. Similarly, action 3 includes left, which could be problematic in some cases.

I should map out each state and decide which actions are safest. For example:

- States near the top-left (0,1,2,3) might benefit from moving right or down.
- Middle states need to balance between moving towards the goal and avoiding holes.
- The bottom-right area (states 12-15) should have a policy that leads directly to state 15.

Perhaps a greedy approach where each state's action is chosen based on the direction leading closer to state 15, considering the possible slips. For instance, in state 0 (top-left), moving right or down could be better than up since up would keep it in place.

Let me draft a possible policy:

- For states that are not in the last row or column, prefer actions that move towards the goal.
- In the last row and column, ensure that actions lead directly to state 15 or avoid holes.

I also need to remember that the agent can't plan based on previous attempts due to being stateless. So each proposed policy should be unique and aim to maximize information gain about which states are safe and which aren't.

Given the recent policies didn't yield high rewards, I might need to try more exploratory actions, especially in areas where holes are likely. Maybe setting certain states to move in directions that haven't been tried before could reveal new trajectories and help identify safer paths.

I think a good next step is to propose a policy where each state's action is designed to move towards the goal as much as possible, considering the possible slips. For example:

- In state 0 (top-left), choose an action that includes right or down.
- In states along the top row, prefer moving down.
- In the first column, prefer moving right.

Let me try creating such a policy and see if it leads to better rewards.
