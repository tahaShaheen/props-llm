You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help optimize a policy for the FrozenLake environment using the given setup. The goal is to reach state 15 with the highest possible reward, considering that the environment is slippery and has holes. 

First, I need to understand how the environment works. It's a 4x4 grid where each cell represents a state from 0 to 15. Moving left, right, up, or down can lead to different directions due to the slipperiness. The agent gets +1 reward upon reaching state 15 and 0 otherwise, but some states are holes that end the episode.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 actions (each from 0-3), where each index corresponds to a state. My task is to propose these parameters in such a way that the agent maximizes its reward, ideally getting as close as possible to 1.0.

Looking at the history provided, there have been several attempts with different params configurations and their corresponding rewards. The top-performing ones had rewards around 0.45, which is still below the target of 1.0. The most recent trials yielded very low rewards (around 0.05), indicating that those policies are not effective.

Since the current rewards are far below the target, I should adopt an exploratory strategy to find new configurations rather than tweaking existing ones. This means suggesting params that haven't been tried before to gather more information about which states lead to success or failure.

I also need to make sure that the suggested policy avoids leading the agent into holes. To do this, I'll review the trajectories provided and identify patterns in how the agent navigates. For example, if a certain state tends to lead towards a hole regardless of action, I might adjust the policy for that state to choose a different action.

Another consideration is the structure of the grid. The optimal path likely involves moving right or down from the start (state 0). However, due to the slippery nature, the agent needs a robust strategy that accounts for possible drifts in direction without falling into traps.

I'll now propose a new set of params. I'll ensure each state is assigned an action that generally moves towards the goal but also avoids risky states. For instance, starting at state 0 (top-left), choosing right or down might be better. However, since actions are probabilistic, the policy needs to balance between exploration and exploitation.

After analyzing previous attempts, some patterns emerge where certain actions led to longer paths without success. By changing a few key states' actions, I can test if those changes lead the agent towards the goal more efficiently or avoid holes.

Finally, considering that I must output only one line with params values from 0-3 for each state, I'll structure my proposal accordingly, ensuring no duplication of previous configurations to maximize information gain.
