You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I need to figure out the best policy parameters for the FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with a reward of +1, and all other states give 0. The agent can move in four directions, but when it takes an action, there's an equal probability (25%) for each direction unless specified otherwise.

First, I should understand the environment better. The grid is 4x4, so the states range from 0 to 15. The robot starts at state 0, which is top-left. To get out of a hole, like on row 3 (state 12), stepping into it ends the game.

The policy function maps each state to an action with values in params[0] to params[14]. Each parameter can be 0, 1, 2, or 3. The value of each param[i] is the probability of taking action i when at state i.

I need to find parameters that guide the agent away from holes and efficiently explore the grid. Since it's a deterministic policy (actions are chosen based on current state), I can't exploit any future knowledge; I have to stick with the current exploration.

Looking at the examples provided, some policies avoid the hole but sometimes get stuck near it again. Others seem more risk-averse by taking multiple actions or looping around.

I should consider using an epsilon-greedy approach where occasionally (epsilon=0.1) the agent takes a random action to explore nearby states. This can help escape local minima and find better policies.

Another idea is to use a Boltzmann distribution, where each action's probability depends on its temperature. Lower temperature means more deterministic exploration, while higher temperature allows some randomness.

I should also think about the state space. Each state has four possible actions, making 16 parameters in total. This gives enough flexibility for exploration but might require careful tuning to avoid overfitting or excessive computation.

Perhaps I can implement an iterative approach where each iteration randomly perturbs the current policy based on the best-performing parameters. Or use gradient ascent if a reward function is derived from f(params).

But without knowing, maybe sticking with random actions initially and gradually introducing more exploration (like epsilons) would be better, ensuring that all states are adequately sampled.

I need to sample enough initial params to cover different action distributions. Since the optimal is unknown, I should start with diverse parameters, some deterministic and some stochastic, to allow exploration without biasing towards any single path.

Maybe using multiple seeds of parameter sampling and averaging could help converge on a good policy. But for now, starting with a few initial samples could provide insights.

I'll also consider that the best global optimal is around None, meaning I need to ensure the agent explores sufficiently to find it without getting stuck in local optima.

So, my plan is: start by sampling various parameter combinations (some deterministic and some stochastic), run the policy several times, evaluate their rewards, then gradually add more randomness. This should allow the agent to explore different paths and converge towards a good policy.
