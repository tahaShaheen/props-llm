You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. So, the environment is a 4x4 grid called FrozenLake, and the goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right corner) which gives a reward of +1. All other states give 0, but there are holes that end the episode if stepped on.

The agent's actions aren't straightforward because the environment is slippery. When an action is taken, the agent moves in one of three directions with equal probability. For example, taking action 0 could result in moving down, left, or up. The same goes for other actions, each with their own set of possible movements.

The policy is defined by a parameter array 'params' where each element corresponds to an action (0-3) for the respective state (0-15). My task is to find the optimal policy that maximizes the episodic reward.

Looking at the previous interactions and top params, I notice that most of them have f(params) around 0.35-0.45, which is below the target of 1.0. This suggests we're in the exploration phase since the rewards aren't close to optimal yet.

I need to propose a new set of parameters that haven't been tried before and could potentially lead to higher rewards. From the trajectories provided, it seems like some policies get stuck in loops or don't reach the goal efficiently because of the slippery nature.

So, I should design a policy where each state directs towards moving closer to the goal, considering all possible movements due to slipping. Maybe setting actions that generally push the agent towards the right and down since the goal is at (3,3).

I'll go through each state:

- State 0 (top-left): Possible actions are 1, which can move right, down, or left. Choosing action 1 might help in moving towards the goal.

Wait, no. The action definitions are a bit tricky. Let me clarify:

Action 0: [down, left, up]
Action 1: [right, down, left]
Action 2: [up, right, down]
Action 3: [left, up, right]

So for state 0 (row 0, column 0), the goal is to get towards row 3, column 3. So moving down or right would be beneficial.

Looking at action 1 from state 0: it can move right (to state 1), down (to state 4), or left (which would stay in state 0). Action 2 from state 0 could move up (but that's invalid, so stays), right, or down. So perhaps choosing action 1 for state 0.

Similarly, for other states near the edges, I can set actions that push towards the goal direction while considering all possible outcomes due to slipping.

Let me try constructing a policy where each state tends to move either right or down as much as possible, using the available actions that have those directions.

After mapping this out for each state, ensuring no previously seen params are used and making sure to avoid holes by choosing safe actions. But since the environment is slippery, the agent might not always reach the goal directly, but the policy should maximize the chances of eventually getting there.
