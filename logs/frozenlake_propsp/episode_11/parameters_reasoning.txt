You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to find the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 (the right bottom grid) and get a reward of +1. All other states give 0 reward. There are some holes in the map that will end the game if stepped on, which means we might have to explore further.

The policy is represented by an array of 16 values, each corresponding to a state from 0 to 15. Each value is 0, 1, 2, or 3, indicating the action to take in that state. The initial params are all set to 1, but I can adjust them through exploration.

Since it's an episodic reward problem with rewards dependent on the path taken (because of the slippery policy), I need a way to explore different actions without getting stuck in local optima. The agent should use existing trajectories and pick actions that avoid the holes by considering the history.

Looking at the examples provided, some parameters result in higher f(params) values like 1.00 or 0.15, while others are worse. It seems that certain patterns of action choices lead to better exploration towards the goal but sometimes may not explore enough if they get stuck in local optima.

I need to propose new param values from [0, 1, 2, 3] for each state, ensuring no duplicates with previous examples except those explicitly shown. I should aim for a value of around 1 that explores more without over-exploring, potentially focusing on the lower states (top-left and top-right) which are closer to the goal.

Let me think: starting from the first action in each state:

- State 0 is top-left; perhaps action 2 would move down, but since it's slippery, there might be other options. Alternatively, action 1 or 3 could give different paths.
- Similarly, for other states, choosing actions that lead towards higher reward states without getting caught.

I need a systematic way to choose the next values. Maybe starting from the top, trying each parameter and evaluating how f(params) changes. But since I have to pick one set, perhaps balancing action variety across the top rows is better than too much repetition.

Looking at some good examples: params[0]: 2 gives higher rewards but might not explore enough. Another example uses 1 for state 0 and others in a similar pattern which could be beneficial.

Alternatively, focusing on avoiding hole states by sometimes choosing actions that lead away from holes or towards the goal more directly.

But without specific data, it's hard to decide. I'll try selecting parameters where each top row action (params[0],1,2) is 2 except when necessary for exploration.

Wait, looking at some examples: params[6]:1 gives good rewards but might not be optimal in the top rows. Perhaps varying them a bit more.

Alternatively, trying to have higher values in states that are closer to the goal could help with immediate rewards and avoid getting stuck.

I think a balanced approach where in each state on the top rows (0,1,2) we try 0,1,2,3 in some order would explore different paths. Maybe starting with params[0]=1, params[1]=2, etc., but not repeating unless it's necessary.

Alternatively, using a strategy that sometimes takes action 3 to avoid getting stuck by occasionally exploring the other actions when near holes.
