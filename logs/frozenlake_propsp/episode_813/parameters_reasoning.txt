You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, let's try to figure out the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. So, from what I understand, it's a 4x4 grid where each state has some holes, and the goal is to reach state 15 with the highest possible reward. The agent can move in four directions, but due to the slippery nature, each action leads to three possible next states with equal probability.

First, I need to remember that the environment is slippery, so moving left, right, up, or down doesn't directly take you where you intended. Instead, there's a 1/3 chance of going in one direction and 2/3 in others depending on the action taken. Wait, actually, according to the problem statement, each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability. So for example, choosing action 0 (left) would make you go down, left, or up with a 1/3 chance each.

The key here is to design a policy that maximizes the chances of reaching state 15 while avoiding any holes. The optimal reward should be around 1.0, meaning the agent successfully reaches the goal without falling into a hole in most episodes.

Looking at the previous attempts and their trajectories, it seems like the current policies are not consistently getting to the goal. Most have rewards around 0.45 or lower, which suggests there's room for improvement. The top-performing params had a reward of 0.45, but we need to get closer to 1.0.

I notice that in some trajectories, the agent gets stuck moving in circles or ends up in states that don't lead towards the goal. For example, one trajectory went (0,3) multiple times and eventually fell into a hole. So maybe the policy needs adjustments to avoid such loops and keep moving towards the goal.

Since I'm supposed to act as an optimizer now because the rewards are below 1.0 but not too low, I should tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak. The previous top params had specific actions in certain states that allowed them to reach state 8 and then maybe proceed further. However, they might be missing something in later states or getting stuck.

Let me think about each state's optimal action:

1. Start at state 0 (top-left). The best move is probably right (action 1) because it leads towards the goal, but considering the slipperiness, choosing an action that has a higher probability of moving towards the right might be better.
2. State 1: Maybe down or right to get closer to the bottom-right.
3. Continue this reasoning for each state, ensuring that from each position, the chosen action has a high chance of leading towards the goal without stepping into holes.

I should also consider which states are holes. The problem mentions some holes but doesn't specify their locations. From the trajectories provided, I can infer that certain states are dangerous. For example, in one trajectory, the agent stepped onto state 13 (which is a hole) and fell into it.

So, for each state, I need to define an action that avoids leading towards known holes while pushing towards the goal. If I can map out which states are safe and which aren't, that would help. But since I don't have explicit information on where the holes are, I have to deduce based on trajectories.

Looking at the most recent params, some had issues with getting stuck or falling into holes. So perhaps adjusting certain actions in key states can prevent those pitfalls. For example, if a state near the bottom leads down when it's already in the last row, changing the action could help avoid falling into a hole.

Another consideration is to make sure that from each state, there's a path towards the goal without getting stuck. This might involve preferring certain directions over others based on proximity to the goal.

Since I can't remember previous attempts, but I can see recent ones, I should ensure that the new policy is different enough to explore new trajectories while also exploiting known good paths.

Putting this together, I'll adjust some actions in key states to either move closer to the goal or avoid potential holes. For example, in state 14 (which is just above the goal), choosing an action that moves right would directly lead to the goal, considering the slippery nature might still have a chance to get there.

I think it's time to propose a new set of params where each state's action is chosen to either move towards the goal or avoid known dangerous areas. I'll ensure that from states near the goal, actions are taken that increase the probability of reaching it without stepping into holes.
