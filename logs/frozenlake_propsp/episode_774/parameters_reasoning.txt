You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best next step for optimizing the policy in this FrozenLake environment. Let me start by understanding the problem thoroughly.

The environment is a 4x4 grid where each state can transition probabilistically due to the slippery nature. The goal is to reach state 15 with the highest reward, while avoiding holes which end the episode immediately. The policy is defined as an array of 16 actions (each from 0-3) mapping states 0-15 to actions.

Looking at the provided information, I see that up to now, several policies have been tested, and their average rewards over 20 episodes are listed. The top-performing ones have rewards around 0.45, which is still below the target of 1.0. This suggests we're not yet near optimal performance.

The recent parameters provided include a mix of different actions across states. For example, the last two policies tried had varying actions in state 0 (params[0]) as either 3 or 1, and other states also varied. The trajectories show that some policies reach the goal but with lower rewards, indicating room for improvement.

Since we're at iteration 774 out of 5000, there's still a lot of room to explore more policies. Given that previous top rewards are around 0.45, which is significantly below the target of 1.0, I should focus on exploration rather than exploitation right now.

To maximize information gain and avoid previously seen parameters, I need to propose a new set of params that haven't been tried before. Looking at the existing top policies, I notice that certain states might be taking suboptimal actions. For instance, state 0 is often taking action 1 or 3. Maybe trying a different action here could lead to better exploration towards the goal.

I should also consider the structure of the grid. The optimal path likely involves moving right and down from the starting point (state 0) towards state 15. However, due to the slippery nature, each action has multiple possible outcomes. So, the policy needs to account for these probabilities and choose actions that maximize the chance of reaching the goal without falling into holes.

I'll start by modifying a few key states where previous policies have been consistent but perhaps not optimal. For example, in state 0 (top-left corner), instead of action 1 or 3, maybe action 2 could help move towards the right or down more effectively. Similarly, other states might benefit from different actions to navigate around holes.

I'll also check if certain states have been consistently leading to dead-ends and adjust their actions accordingly. For instance, if a particular state often leads to a hole when taking an action, changing that action could prevent failure and allow the agent to explore new paths.

After considering these points, I'll construct a new set of params where several key states are given different actions than before. This will ensure we're exploring new trajectories and potentially finding a path that reaches the goal more efficiently.
