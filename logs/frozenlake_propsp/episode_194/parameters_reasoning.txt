You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me start by understanding the setup.

The environment is a 4x4 grid where each state represents a cell. The goal is state 15 (bottom right corner), which gives +1 reward. All other states give 0, except if you fall into a hole, which ends the episode with no reward. The slippery nature means that taking an action can lead to three possible moves, each with equal probability.

From the problem description, I know that the policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers (params[0] to params[15]), each indicating the action taken in that state. The actions are 0-3, corresponding to different movement directions.

Looking at the previous examples provided, all the policies have had low rewards around 0.10 or lower. The global optimal reward should be around 1.0, so clearly, these aren't great policies yet. It seems like none of them are reaching the goal consistently, which might mean they're falling into holes too often or not navigating effectively.

I need to propose a new set of params that's distinct from previous ones and has the potential to reach the goal without hitting any holes. Since all prior attempts have been exploratory (as rewards are low), I should continue exploring by suggesting different configurations.

One strategy is to focus on states near the goal and ensure their policies guide towards state 15. For example, state 12 is just above the goal; maybe setting its action to move right or down could help reach 15. Similarly, state 14 (to the left of 15) should probably move right.

But considering the slippery nature, each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability. So, for states near the edges or holes, choosing actions that minimize falling into holes is crucial. Maybe certain directions are safer than others depending on their neighbors.

Looking at the grid layout:

- The goal is state 15 (bottom right). States adjacent to it are 14 (left), 11 (up), and maybe others.
- Holes are present in some states, but without knowing exactly where, I have to infer based on trajectories. For example, if a trajectory leads to a hole, that state's action might be risky.

Given the trajectories provided, it seems like many policies get stuck or fall into holes early on. So, perhaps focusing on getting policies that avoid immediate falls and work towards the goal is key.

I should generate a policy where most states near the edges are set to move towards the goal in a way that avoids known problematic areas. For example:

- Start from state 0: moving right (action 1) could be better than down, as it moves towards the goal.
- States along the top row might benefit from moving right or down, depending on their position.

I think a possible approach is to set each state's action to move in the direction that would get closer to state 15. However, since movement is probabilistic, I need to choose actions that have a higher chance of moving towards the goal without stepping into holes.

Another thought: perhaps setting up a policy where states near the bottom and right edges are set to move towards the goal with high probability. For example:

- State 12 (bottom left) could be set to move right or down.
- State 13 (to the right of 12) might benefit from moving right.
- Similarly, state 14 should move right.

But without knowing where exactly the holes are, it's a bit tricky. However, based on previous trajectories, I can see that some policies end quickly in certain states, suggesting those might be near holes or lead to them.

I think for this iteration, given that rewards have been low and we're in an exploratory phase, I should propose a policy where each state is set to move in the direction that would take it closer to 15. For example:

- States in the top row (0-3) might be set to move down or right.
- Middle states could alternate actions to explore paths towards the goal.

Alternatively, perhaps setting all states except those adjacent to holes to move right or down when possible. But without knowing where the holes are, this is speculative.

Wait, looking at the trajectories provided, some agents get stuck in loops, like (0,3) repeating multiple times before moving. This suggests that certain actions from state 3 might be leading back to the same area or into a hole.

Maybe for state 15, setting action 2 could help, but since it's the goal, perhaps any action is fine as long as it doesn't move away.

I think I'll propose a policy where each state moves towards the right or down, avoiding left and up unless necessary. For example:

- Even-numbered states (0, 4, 8, 12) might be set to move right.
- Odd-numbered states might be set to move down.

But considering that movement is probabilistic, I need to ensure that the chosen actions have a path towards the goal without high risk of falling into holes.

Alternatively, perhaps setting all states to action 0 (move down with some probability) except for those where moving right would directly lead towards the goal. But this might not be optimal either.

Wait, another angle: in the initial examples, many policies had params[15] set to various actions but didn't reach the goal. So perhaps state 15's action isn't as crucial since it's the terminal state. Maybe focusing on states that lead into 15 is more important.

I think I'll proceed by suggesting a policy where each state moves towards the right or down, depending on their position, to increase the chance of reaching state 15 without falling into holes.
