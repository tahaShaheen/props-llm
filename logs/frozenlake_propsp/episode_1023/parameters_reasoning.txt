You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to solve this FrozenLake environment problem. The goal is to find the optimal policy that maximizes the reward by reaching state 15 without falling into any holes. 

First, I need to understand how the environment works. It's a 4x4 grid with states numbered from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). Each action taken by the agent has a probability of moving in three directions due to the slippery nature. The policy is determined by an array of 16 numbers, each representing the action taken in that state.

The challenge is to design this policy such that it avoids holes and reaches the goal as efficiently as possible. Since the environment is probabilistic, some actions might lead to different states with equal probability. Therefore, the optimal policy needs to account for these possibilities and choose actions that maximize the chances of reaching the goal without falling into a hole.

Looking at the provided trajectories, I notice that many policies are yielding rewards around 0.35-0.45, which is below the target of 1.0. This suggests that while some progress is being made, there's room for improvement.

I recall that in such grid worlds, a common approach is to have policies that guide the agent towards the goal by moving right or down, considering the slippery nature. For example, in state 0 (top-left), taking action 1 might move the agent right with some probability. Similarly, states closer to the goal should encourage movements towards it.

However, since each action leads to three possible directions, I need to ensure that each policy choice is robust against these probabilities. Perhaps setting actions that generally guide towards the goal while avoiding holes by steering clear of known dangerous areas.

Looking at state 15, which is the goal, any policy in this state should ideally stay there or not move, but since it's already the target, the action doesn't matter as much once reached.

Another consideration is the slippery nature. For example, if an agent takes action 0 (left), it might end up moving down, left, or up with equal probability. So, I need to choose actions that, on average, push the agent towards the goal despite these probabilities.

I think a greedy approach would be best here, where each state's policy directs the agent towards the goal as much as possible. For instance:

- States in row 0 (top) should encourage moving right or down.
- States in row 1 should move right or further down.
- States in row 2 should focus on moving down to reach the bottom row quickly.

However, I also need to consider the holes. Since the exact positions of the holes aren't specified, the policy must be designed such that it avoids them by either taking safe paths or actions that don't lead into these dangerous states.

Looking at the recent policies and their trajectories, many end up in loops or fail to reach the goal within a few steps. To break this, I might need to adjust certain states' actions to push the agent more directly towards the goal without getting stuck.

For example, in state 14 (bottom-right except for 15), taking action 3 (right) would be ideal if possible, but since it's already on the rightmost column, perhaps staying still isn't an option. Alternatively, moving up or down might not help. So, maybe setting action to move up or something that doesn't risk falling into a hole.

Wait, actually, in state 14 (which is row 3, column 2), taking action 0 might have probabilities of moving down (to 15), left (13), or up (row 2). Since moving down leads to the goal, I should prioritize that. So, for state 14, choosing an action that increases the chance of moving down.

Looking back at the policy structure, each params[i] represents the action for state i. To ensure maximum efficiency, states closer to the goal (like 12, 13, 14) should have actions that primarily aim to move towards the goal.

In summary, I need to set up a policy where each state's action is chosen to maximize the probability of moving towards the goal, considering the slippery nature and avoiding holes. This likely involves a combination of right and down movements in the earlier states and more direct approaches in the later ones.
