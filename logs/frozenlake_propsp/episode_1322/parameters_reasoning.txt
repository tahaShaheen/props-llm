You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 1322 out of 5000. OUTPUT ONLY THIS SINGLE LINE:
params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W
Do NOT output anything else. No explanation, no reasoning, nothing.



LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's try to figure this out step by step. So, the environment is a 4x4 grid where the agent moves around, but it's slippery—so when you take an action, there's a 33% chance of going in each of three directions instead of the one intended. The goal is state 15 (bottom right corner), which gives +1 reward. Holes are present, and stepping on them ends the episode.

The policy is represented by an array called params, where each element corresponds to a state and determines the action taken from there. My task is to propose values for this array that maximize the reward over multiple episodes.

Looking at the problem statement, I need to follow a specific interaction pattern. Since we're at iteration 1322 out of 5000, it's not too late yet, but I should focus on optimizing based on previous data.

From the provided examples, the best performing policies have f(params) around 0.45 or lower. The goal is to reach 1.0, so we're still exploring rather than exploiting because the rewards aren't close enough. That means my strategy should be more about exploration now.

I need to look at the trajectories and see what's happening. For example, in one of the top policies, the agent took a lot of steps without reaching the goal, getting stuck in loops. This suggests that some states might not lead effectively towards 15 or fall into holes.

Since I'm supposed to be stateless and can't remember previous attempts, I have to rely solely on the information given in each interaction. The key is to maximize information gain by choosing parameters that could reveal more about the environment's structure.

In the recent params examples, some actions led to immediate failures (like falling into holes), while others looped endlessly without reaching the goal. To improve this, I should consider changing the policy in such a way that it either avoids known dangerous states or pushes towards the goal more effectively.

I notice that state 15 is the only rewarding state. So, from each state, the policy should ideally choose actions that increase the probability of eventually reaching 15 without stepping into holes. But since we don't know where the holes are exactly, it's tricky.

One approach could be to have policies that try different paths and see which ones succeed. For example, setting some states to move towards a central point or directly towards the goal might help.

Looking at the recent params provided, many of them either lead to loops or end up in non-productive states. Maybe I can adjust certain actions for key states like 0 (top-left), 15 (target), and other strategic positions.

Since the agent is on a grid, movement should ideally be towards state 15. So from each state, the optimal action would be one that has the highest probability of moving closer to 15, considering the slippery nature.

But since the environment's holes are unknown, I have to make educated guesses based on past trajectories. For instance, if in a certain state, taking action X leads to failure often, maybe I should try another action for that state.

In this case, let's consider changing some key states' actions. Maybe from state 14 (which is the cell above the goal), moving right would take it to state 15 directly, but due to slipperiness, there's a chance it might go elsewhere. So setting params[14] to an action that has a higher chance of going towards 15.

But without knowing exactly where the holes are, I have to be cautious. Perhaps choosing actions for each state that spread out the movement options but increase the likelihood of reaching the goal.

I think it's time to propose a new set of parameters that might lead the agent towards the goal more efficiently while avoiding dangerous states based on prior trajectories.
