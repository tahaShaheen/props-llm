You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with the highest possible reward, and we're dealing with a slippery world where actions can result in moving in one of three directions each with equal probability.

First, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. The grid is 4x4, so states are numbered from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). Each state has four possible actions: left, down, right, up, which correspond to action values 0-3. However, because of the slipperiness, each action leads to three possible moves. For example, taking action 0 could result in moving down, left, or up.

The policy is a function that maps each state (from 0 to 15) to an action (0-3). The challenge is to determine which actions for each state lead the agent to reach the goal at state 15 without falling into any holes.

Looking at the provided examples, it seems that most policies aren't performing well yet. All top-performing params have f(params) around 0.15, which is quite low. The best reward so far is only 0.15, and our goal should be around 1.0, meaning we need a much better policy.

The recent trajectories show that many policies are getting stuck or falling into holes. For example, some are looping in the same state repeatedly, others are moving towards edges where they might fall into holes.

I notice that in the top-performing params, states near the goal (like 14 and 15) have specific actions. In one of them, params[15]:3 is set to action 3. That would mean from state 15, which is the goal, taking action 3 could lead to moving left, up, or right. But since it's already at the goal, perhaps staying in place or not moving might be better. However, I'm not sure.

Wait, actually, once you reach state 15, that's a terminal state, so any actions from there don't matter because the episode ends. So maybe the policies should be designed to get to state 15 as quickly as possible and avoid getting stuck or falling into holes along the way.

Given that the environment is slippery, it's challenging to predict where each action will take the agent. Therefore, a good policy might need to explore actions that have the highest probability of leading towards the goal while minimizing the risk of falling into holes.

Looking at the recent params, some are setting various states to action 1 or 3. I'm not sure which is better. Maybe it's worth trying different combinations for key states like those near the top and left edges where holes might be more common.

I also need to remember that each time I propose a new policy, I should avoid any previous policies to ensure maximum exploration. So, if I see a lot of similar policies in the buffer, I should vary them as much as possible until we get closer to high rewards.

In this case, since the current best reward is 0.15, which is far below 1.0, I'm in "explorer" mode, so I need to choose a policy that's significantly different from previous ones to gather more information about the environment and possible paths to the goal.

I think I'll try setting most states towards moving right or down, as those directions would generally lead towards the goal (state 15). But I should also make sure that near the edges and holes, the policies don't cause the agent to fall into them. For example, from state 3 (top row, third column), if action is set to move left, right, or down, but there's a hole in one of those directions, we need to avoid that.

Perhaps setting states near the edges to move towards the goal while avoiding risky moves. Maybe for states on the top row, encourage moving right, and for states on the left column, encourage moving down. For other states, perhaps alternating actions based on their position.

I'll try creating a policy where most states are set to action 2 or 3, which include movements towards the goal, while ensuring that edge states don't lead into holes.
