You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. It's a 4x4 grid where the agent can move in four directions, but because it's slippery, each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability. The goal is state 15, which gives +1 reward, and there are holes that end the episode if stepped on.

From the provided information, I see that the current best policies have f(params) around 0.10, which is much lower than the target of 1.0. This suggests that the agent isn't reliably reaching the goal without falling into holes.

Looking at the trajectories, most attempts end quickly either by falling into a hole or not making progress towards the goal. For example, one trajectory was (0,1) leading to (4,2), then (8,2), which probably didn't reach 15 and might have fallen into a hole. Another trajectory went from (0,3) all the way without success.

I need to propose a new set of params that explores more effectively or moves towards the goal with higher precision. Since the agent can't remember past attempts, each suggestion must be unique and aimed at maximizing information gain.

One approach is to have policies that guide the agent towards the right and down directions as much as possible since state 15 is at the bottom-right corner. For instance, in state 0 (top-left), moving right or down could be beneficial. However, considering the slippery nature, each action might not lead directly to the intended move.

I'll consider setting params such that from each state, the agent's policy has a higher chance of moving towards the goal. For example, from state 0, choosing actions that have a tendency to move right or down. But since each action can go in three directions randomly, I need to ensure that over time, the agent drifts towards the goal.

Perhaps setting params[i] for each state to prioritize actions that would generally take it closer to 15. For instance:

- From states on the top row (0-3), moving down or right might be better.
- From leftmost column (states 0,4,8,12), moving right is essential.
- From other states, moving towards the bottom-right.

I should also avoid actions that could lead to holes. For example, certain movements from specific states are more risky and should be minimized.

Given that previous attempts didn't reach the goal, I'll try a policy where each state's action is chosen to move right or down as much as possible without getting stuck. Maybe setting params for states near the top-left to push towards moving right, and for others, balance between down and right.

After considering these factors, here's a new set of params that tries to guide the agent more effectively towards the goal while avoiding holes.
