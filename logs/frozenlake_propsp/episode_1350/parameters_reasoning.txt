You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get as close to a reward of 1.0 as possible, which means reaching state 15 without falling into any holes. 

Looking at the problem, the environment is a 4x4 grid with slippery movements. When an action is taken, the agent moves in one of three directions with equal probability. The policy is represented by an array of 16 actions (each from 0 to 3) that map each state to an action.

The user provided some top-performing params and recent ones, but all seem to be getting rewards around 0.45 or lower, which is way below the target of 1.0. This suggests that the current policies aren't efficiently navigating towards the goal without falling into holes too often.

Since I'm supposed to act as a stateless optimizer, I need to focus on maximizing information gain each step. If the rewards are low, I should explore new configurations rather than tweaking existing ones. The trajectories show that some paths lead to immediate falls or getting stuck in loops, indicating that certain states aren't handled well.

I'll consider changing the actions for states near the holes to avoid them. For example, if a state next to a hole is always moving towards it, maybe choosing a different action could prevent that. Also, ensuring that the paths lead towards the goal (state 15) without unnecessary risks is crucial.

Looking at the recent params, they had lower rewards, so I'll try to vary the actions for key states. Maybe adjusting the actions in states like 0 (top-left corner) and 3 (top-right corner) could help. Perhaps making state 0 move right or down more often might lead towards the goal.

I'll propose a new set of params where each state's action is chosen to either directly move towards the goal or avoid known holes. For instance, in states that are close to the goal, choosing actions that increase the chance of moving right or down could be beneficial. Also, for states near holes, selecting actions that have higher probabilities of moving away from the hole.

After considering these factors, I'll create a new params array where each state's action is set to the one that best avoids holes and directs towards the goal based on their position. This should help in either reaching the goal more often or avoiding dangerous states.
