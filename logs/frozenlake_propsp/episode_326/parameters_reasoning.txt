You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best action-value parameters for the FrozenLake environment using a policy gradient method like REINFORCE. The goal is to maximize the reward by reaching state 15, which gives +1, while avoiding holes on the map that could trap me if I step into them.

First, I need to understand the problem setup. The grid has 4x4 states labeled from 0 to 15. Each action (up, down, left, right) leads to a certain state with equal probability when using a deterministic policy. However, since the environment is slippery, each action can lead to the next or previous state with some probability, specifically two out of three options have an equal chance.

The agent's initial parameters are all 1s, but I need to find better values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. Each parameter represents which action (0 for down, 1 for right, etc.) is taken when in a state. The function f(params) calculates the total reward obtained.

From the examples provided, some parameters lead to lower rewards like 0.25 or even zero. So I need to find parameters that avoid these traps and instead navigate towards state 15 efficiently.

I recall that in policy gradient methods, we often use techniques like REINFORCE or PPO. Since all states are within a small grid (4x4), the algorithm should be manageable. The main challenge is ensuring the agent explores different paths without getting stuck on holes.

I should start by considering each possible action for each state and see how it affects the reward. For instance, taking the right action (param[1]) when in state 0 leads to state 3 with two out of three probabilities. But I also need to consider other states where this could have different effects.

Another important aspect is that parameters cannot be repeated across different steps. So each parameter value should be unique, and I need to avoid repeating them unless they lead to better performance.

I think about the optimal policy: the agent should prioritize moving towards state 15 while avoiding forbidden states. So perhaps a combination of right and down moves would be ideal. But given the slippery nature, sometimes a left or up action is necessary to find the path.

Maybe trying parameters like [2,3,1,0], which are all different, could be a starting point. This represents taking the middle actions for each state. I can evaluate if this leads to higher rewards than the default 1s.

But perhaps there's a better set of values. For example, using action 1 (right) when needed and others otherwise might help. So parameters like [0,3,2,1] could be explored, where for each state, right is taken as much as possible except in forbidden states.

I also need to balance exploration and exploitation. If I set all params to 0, the agent might converge too quickly to a suboptimal policy or get stuck. So a mix of some parameters higher than others can encourage both immediate action selection (exploitation) and random choices (exploration).

Given that the examples provided don't show better than zero, maybe focusing on avoiding forbidden states is key. Forbidden states would likely result in negative rewards if not handled correctly.

In conclusion, I should set different parameters for each state to encourage exploration while prioritizing certain actions based on their location near the goal. This might involve trying out various combinations and evaluating their outcomes during training.
