You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to propose the next set of parameters for the FrozenLake environment to maximize the episodic reward. The goal is to reach state 15, and there are holes that end the episode if stepped on. The policy is defined by an array of 16 actions (each being 0-3) corresponding to each state.

From the problem statement, I know that the environment is slippery, meaning each action leads to one of three possible directions with equal probability. This adds a layer of uncertainty because even if the agent takes a specific action, it might not end up where it intended.

Looking at the examples provided, the best performing policies so far have an average reward around 0.25. The top trajectories show that some states are leading towards holes or getting stuck in loops. For instance, one trajectory went (0,1) -> (4,2) -> (8,2), which probably ended without reaching the goal.

The recent parameters tried include various combinations, but none have achieved a reward close to 1.0 yet. The most recent attempt had a very low reward of 0.05 and 0.00, suggesting it might be getting stuck or falling into holes frequently.

As an optimizer, since the rewards are still below 1.0, I should tweak the best parameters slightly. But looking at the top params, they seem to have a mix of actions that aren't necessarily leading directly towards the goal each time.

I need to consider how each action from every state can lead closer to state 15 while avoiding holes. For example, in state 0 (top-left), moving right or down would be better since it's trying to get to the bottom-right. But because of the slipperiness, choosing an action that has a higher probability of moving towards the goal is essential.

Let me think about each state:

- State 0: Moving right (action 1) might take it to state 1, but due to slipping, it could go down or left. Maybe action 2 (up) isn't useful here since it's already at the top. So perhaps action 3 which includes right and other directions?

Wait, no, each action from a state leads to three possible moves with equal probability. For example, taking action 0 in state i would lead to moving down, left, or up. So I need to map out for each state what actions are most likely to get closer to the goal without hitting holes.

But since I don't know where the holes are exactly (they aren't specified), the agent must learn through trial and error which actions from certain states lead to failures (holes) and avoid them.

Given that, the policy should encourage movements towards the goal while avoiding known dangerous states. From the trajectories, some seem to get stuck in loops or fall into holes, so perhaps adjusting certain states' actions could help break those cycles.

Looking at the top params, they have a mix of actions. Maybe I can change some actions in key states to push more towards the right and down directions, which would generally lead toward state 15.

For example, state 0 (params[0]) is currently set to 2 in one of the top policies. Action 2 from state 0 leads to moving up, right, or down. But since we're at the top-left, moving right or down is better. Maybe changing it to action 1, which includes right, left, and down.

Similarly, for other states near the edges or in positions that could lead towards the goal, adjusting their actions might help. For example, state 7 (top-right) should move down, but if slipping occurs, it needs to handle that.

I also notice that some trajectories are getting stuck in certain areas, like looping between states without progress. So maybe changing the action in state 4 or 5 could prevent getting stuck there.

Considering all this, I think a good approach is to set most actions towards moving right and down unless they're in positions where that would risk falling into a hole. But since we don't know the holes' locations, it's tricky. However, based on the trajectories provided, certain states might be leading towards holes more often than others.

Perhaps increasing the number of 'right' and 'down' actions across most states, except for those near the edges where moving right or down would take them out of bounds (which in FrozenLake would probably stay in place or move to a neighboring state).

Wait, but in FrozenLake, movement is on a grid. So from state 0 (0,0), moving right goes to 1 (0,1), moving down goes to 4 (1,0). Similarly, other states have their respective movements.

So for each state, I need to choose an action that gives the highest probability of moving towards the goal while avoiding known bad paths.

But without knowing where the holes are, it's a bit challenging. However, from the trajectories given, some seem to fail by not making progress or getting stuck. So perhaps adjusting the actions in states that are near the bottom-right to push more towards state 15.

Alternatively, since the environment is slippery and each action leads to three possible moves, maybe using an optimistic approach where the agent tries to move directly towards the goal as much as possible, with the understanding that slipping might cause it to take a different path but still within the vicinity.

Given all this, I think setting most states' actions to either 'right' or 'down', depending on their position. For example:

- States in the top row (0-3) should prefer right and down.
- States in the first column (0,4,8,12) might benefit from moving right unless it's state 12, which is already at the bottom-left.

But since I don't have specific knowledge of the holes, perhaps a more general approach is to set actions that encourage movement towards the goal and minimize chances of getting stuck in loops.

Looking back at the top params, some have action 3 for multiple states. Action 3 includes left, up, right. Maybe this isn't ideal because it could lead the agent away from the goal.

Perhaps changing more actions to either move down or right would be better.

So, considering all of this, I think a possible next step is to adjust several key states' actions towards moving right or down, avoiding action 3 where possible, and see if that improves the reward.
