You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to find the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment using a policy optimizer with parameters that are integers between 0 and 3 for each state. Each action (0-3) corresponds to a direction the agent can move, but some actions have equal probabilities due to the slippery nature of the environment.

First, I need to understand how the policy works. The policy is an array where each index represents a state, and the value at that index is the action chosen for that state. Since there are 16 states (0-15), the policy array will have 16 elements. Each element's value determines which action is taken from that state.

The current f(params) value is the total reward accumulated after following this policy. The reward for each state except the goal (state 15) is 0, and stepping into a hole gives -1. However, in this problem statement, it says holes end the game upon stepping on them, but no specific details are given about which states are holes. Since the provided examples include f(params) values around 0.25 or above, it's likely that some states yield negative rewards when stepped onto a hole.

The agent should explore through previously visited trajectories and avoid revisiting the same states to exploit better policies. The challenge is to find the policy configuration that maximizes the total reward (f(params)).

Since the parameters are in [0,1,2,3], each state's action can be chosen from these values. My task is to propose an optimal set of parameters without knowing the exact distribution that gives the highest f(params). I'll need to test various combinations and see which one yields the best rewards over time.

I'll start by considering symmetry in actions. If some actions lead to similar state transitions, their parameter settings might be interchangeable. For example, if actions 0 and 1 are symmetric (both move left or left-right), they could share a parameter value. Similarly, other symmetries can be considered to reduce the number of parameters needed.

I'll also need to evaluate how each action choice affects movement in different states. For instance, moving down is crucial for progressing towards the goal, so that might prefer higher-numbered actions, while avoiding movements that lead into holes (which aren't specified here) would require careful parameter selection.

Since I don't have real-time access to test results from previous iterations, I'll need to make educated guesses based on reasonable assumptions. I'll consider each state's optimal action choice and see how to set the parameters accordingly. For example, if in some states moving down (action 2) yields higher rewards, then params[2] should be set to 3.

Another approach is to consider that the slippery nature of the environment means that all actions have equal probability when a hole isn't stepped on. This could lead the agent to try different actions more often, which might explore various paths and find better policies.

I'll also think about whether certain parameter values cause the agent to favor specific actions consistently across states. For instance, if params[1] (moving right) is set high, it would encourage moving right in all states where that action is chosen, potentially leading towards better rewards.

Since I don't have real data on which parameters give better results, I'll make some logical guesses. I know that when the agent is near the goal (state 15), staying there gives a reward of +1, so the policy should avoid holes and prefer reaching state 15 as quickly as possible. Therefore, perhaps certain parameter settings will encourage the agent to explore towards the goal while avoiding dangerous states.

I'll also consider that setting some parameters higher than others might bias the action selection in specific directions. For example, if a parameter is set to 2 for an action, it might make that action more probable when selected from its respective state group (0-3, etc.). This could encourage certain movements over others in different states.

After considering all these factors, I'll propose parameters that balance exploration and exploitation, avoiding getting stuck on holes while encouraging the agent to reach the goal. It's a trade-off between immediate rewards and long-term benefits.
