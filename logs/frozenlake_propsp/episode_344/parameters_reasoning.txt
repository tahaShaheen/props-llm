You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help this user find the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment using an iterative deep Q-learning approach. The goal is to reach state 15 with a reward of +1, and other states get zero reward. However, some grid cells are holes that can end the game if stepped on.

First, I need to understand how the policy works here. The policy is represented by an array where each element corresponds to a state in the FrozenLake environment. Each action (0-3) has equal probability when the agent takes it based on the params array. So, for example, if params[2] is 1, the agent chooses between up, right, and down randomly.

The user wants me to select values from [0, 1, 2, 3] for each of the 16 states using the params array. The f(params) represents the episodic reward obtained after a certain number of iterations. My goal is to find the optimal policy that maximizes this reward.

Looking at the provided top-performing parameters and their rewards, I see several different configurations. For instance:

- One where params[0] is 2 means when in state 0 (top-left), the agent chooses among up, right, or down with equal probability. This seems to spread out the exploration, not too confident about certain actions.

Another top-performing parameter set has all actions favoring 3 whenever possible. For example, params[1] is 3 for a lot of states, which might suggest a more deterministic approach, prioritizing action 3 (down) or others.

The most recent best-performing parameters have params[0]=2, params[1]=3, etc., leading to some consistent patterns but with some variability. Their reward at iteration 344 was 0.00, which is quite low, suggesting that these policies are not effective in escaping the hole.

Looking at other options, for example, params[6] being 2 means when in state 6 (top-right), the agent chooses between left, up, or right equally. This could be beneficial if avoiding the hole is better than taking a safer route.

But I need to ensure that all states are explored adequately without getting stuck on holes. The user wants to pick actions that don't lead into holes, so perhaps focusing on transitions away from dangerous areas would help.

In conclusion, after evaluating several parameters, some policies consistently avoid holes by prioritizing certain actions or spreading exploration, while others might take more risk. To find the optimal reward, I should test these different parameter configurations and see which one yields the highest episodic rewards across iterations.
