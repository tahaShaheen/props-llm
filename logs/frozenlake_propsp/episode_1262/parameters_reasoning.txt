You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, let's try to figure out the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. So, from what I understand, it's a 4x4 grid where each state is represented by numbers from 0 to 15. The goal is to reach state 15, which gives a reward of +1, while all other states give 0. There are also holes that end the episode if stepped on.

The environment is slippery, meaning when an action is taken, there's a 33% chance to go in each of three possible directions. So for example, taking action 0 (which I think corresponds to moving down) will result in either moving down, left, or up with equal probability.

My task is to determine the optimal policy that maximizes the average reward over multiple episodes. The policy is an array of 16 numbers, each indicating the action taken in each state. Since we can't remember previous attempts (we're stateless), each iteration must be treated independently, and we need to maximize information gain by choosing new parameters.

Looking at the data provided, the top-performing policies have average rewards around 0.45, which is lower than the theoretical maximum of 1.0. This suggests that there's room for improvement. The trajectories show that agents are getting stuck in loops or falling into holes, so I need to adjust the policy to avoid these pitfalls.

I notice that some states near the goal (like state 14 and 15) have certain actions that might lead directly to the goal or into a hole. For example, if state 14 is set to action 3 (right), it would reach the goal with certainty since from state 14, moving right leads to 15. But due to the slippery nature, maybe the policy needs to account for all possible outcomes.

Also, in some trajectories, agents are taking a lot of steps without reaching the goal or falling into holes, indicating inefficient paths. To improve this, I should ensure that each state's action is chosen to maximize the probability of moving towards the goal while avoiding dangerous states.

Given that we're at iteration 1262, and the rewards are still below 0.5, it seems like we're in the exploration phase rather than optimization. So, maybe introducing some new policies that take different actions in certain states could help us discover better paths or avoid holes we haven't encountered yet.

Looking at recent parameters, I see that many of them stick to similar patterns. Perhaps varying the actions for a few critical states (like those near the goal) could lead to higher rewards. For example, changing the action from 3 to 2 in state 14 might help if moving down is safer than right.

But wait, since the environment's slippery, maybe it's better to choose actions that have multiple safe paths towards the goal. So instead of a single best action per state, perhaps varying actions in such a way that all possible outcomes are still on the path towards the goal or avoid holes.

Another approach is to simulate the policy in my mind for each state and see where agents might be failing. For instance, if from a certain state, the chosen action often leads to a hole, changing that action could prevent failures. Let's say in state 5 (which is in the second row, first column), taking action 1 might lead to moving right, down, or left. If moving right leads towards a goal and others are safe, then action 1 might be good.

I also notice that some policies have high rewards but not reaching the maximum. Maybe adjusting a few key states could push the average closer to 1.0. For example, ensuring that state 15 is always in an action that doesn't move (since it's already the goal) or actions that prevent stepping out.

Wait, no—once you reach state 15, the episode ends with a reward of +1. So perhaps once you're there, any action taken won't matter because the episode has ended. Therefore, states leading to 15 should have actions that maximize the chance of reaching it without falling into holes.

Considering all this, I think the optimal policy would be one where each state's action is chosen such that all possible outcomes (due to slipping) either lead towards the goal or avoid holes, and eventually reach the goal in as few steps as possible.
