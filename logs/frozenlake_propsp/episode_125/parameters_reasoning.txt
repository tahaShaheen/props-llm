You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me start by understanding the problem thoroughly.

The environment is a 4x4 grid where the agent can move in four directions: left, down, right, or up. Each state corresponds to a grid cell from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). The goal is to reach state 15 for a reward of +1, and all other states give 0 reward. However, there are holes in the map that end the episode if the agent steps on them.

The policy is defined by an array 'params' where each element represents the action taken when in a specific state. The challenge is to find the optimal set of actions that maximizes the episodic reward, considering that the environment is slippery—each action can lead to three possible directions with equal probability.

Looking at the history provided, I notice that all previous policies have resulted in low rewards (around 0.15 or less). This suggests that the current strategies are not effectively leading the agent towards state 15 while avoiding holes. My goal is to propose a new set of parameters that can improve this situation.

I should consider how each action choice influences the agent's path. Since the environment is slippery, choosing actions that increase the likelihood of moving closer to the goal (state 15) while minimizing the chance of falling into holes is crucial.

Let me think about the structure of the grid:

- The top row (states 0-3) can move down towards state 4.
- Moving right in the top-right corner might lead towards state 7, but that's not the goal. Instead, moving down from there would be better.
- From states near the bottom (like 12), moving right would get closer to 15.

I need to design a policy where each state directs the agent towards the goal without stepping on holes. Since the environment is probabilistic, the policy should account for all possible movements and ensure that over time, the agent can reach the goal safely.

One approach could be to have states near the top move down as much as possible, while states in the middle aim to move right or down towards state 15. However, I need to make sure that this doesn't lead the agent into any holes.

Looking at previous policies, many had params set to cycle between certain actions which might not be effective. Perhaps a more deterministic approach would work better, but given the slipperiness, some randomness is inevitable.

I should also consider if there are specific states where certain actions are safer or more efficient. For example, state 15 (goal) can have any action since it's already achieved, but I might set it to stay in place or loop.

Another thought: maybe starting from the top-left corner, moving right or down towards the goal could be better, depending on where the holes are located.

Wait, actually, since the exact locations of the holes aren't specified, except for knowing that some exist, the policy needs to be robust against various hole placements. So perhaps a greedy approach towards the bottom-right might be best, but with checks to avoid high-risk areas.

Given that previous policies didn't yield high rewards, I need to try different combinations. Maybe adjusting certain states' actions to encourage more exploration or exploit known safe paths.

Let me think about each state's optimal action:

- State 0: Should move right or down. Since it's the top-left corner, moving right (action 1) might lead towards state 3, which is still in the top row. Alternatively, moving down (action 0) takes it to state 4.

But wait, looking at the movement probabilities for each action:

- Action 0: down, left, up.
- Action 1: right, down, left.
- Action 2: up, right, down.
- Action 3: left, up, right.

So when choosing an action, the agent has a mix of directions. Therefore, selecting actions that have higher probabilities to move towards the goal might be beneficial.

For example, if I want the agent in state 0 (top-left) to go down (to state 4), but due to slipperiness, it could also move left or up. However, moving up from state 0 is not possible as it's already on the top row, so perhaps it stays? Or maybe that's a hole.

Wait, no—holes end the episode when stepped on, so I need to ensure that for each state, the chosen action doesn't have any possibility of stepping into a hole. But since holes are part of the environment, and their locations aren't specified, the policy must be designed without knowing exactly where they are.

Alternatively, perhaps certain actions from specific states can avoid holes. For instance, if moving left from state 1 is a hole, then setting that state's action to move right, down, or up could prevent falling into it.

But without knowing the exact hole locations, I have to make general assumptions. Maybe a policy where each state moves towards the bottom-right as much as possible would be optimal.

Looking at state transitions:

- From state 0 (top-left), moving down takes it to 4; right takes it to 1.
- From state 1 (top-middle), moving right goes to 2, left to 0, and down to 5.
- And so on.

If I want the agent to head towards the goal, states in the top should move down, middle states should move right or down, and bottom states should move right.

But considering slipperiness, each action has a mix of directions. So perhaps setting actions that have the highest probability to move towards the goal would be best.

Let me try designing a policy:

- For states 0-3 (top row), set actions that mainly move down.
- For states in rows 1 and 2, set actions that move right or down, depending on their position.
- For bottom row (states 12-15), set actions to move right towards 15.

But since the agent can't directly control where it goes due to slipperiness, I need to choose actions whose possible outcomes are more likely to lead towards the goal.

Wait, perhaps using a model-based approach would help. If I know all possible transitions for each action in each state, I could calculate which action leads to the highest expected reward.

But since I don't have that information, I'll have to make educated guesses.

Looking at the previous policies and their trajectories, it seems like agents often get stuck or fall into holes quickly, suggesting that certain actions from specific states are risky.

For example, in the recent params where f(params) was 0.05, the trajectory started with (0,3), which might have led towards a hole.

Maybe I should try setting state 0 to move right instead of down. Let's see:

- State 0: action 1 (right) would have probabilities moving right (to 1), down (to 4), or left (which is invalid, so perhaps stays? Or it's a hole). Hmm, but if left from 0 leads to a hole, then state 0 should avoid action 3 which includes left as an option.

Alternatively, action 1 for state 0 has possible moves: right (state 1), down (4), or left. If moving left is dangerous, perhaps action 2 is better for state 0, which would include up (invalid), right (to 1), and down (to 4). But since moving up from state 0 isn't possible, it might just try to move towards the bottom-right.

Wait, but without knowing where the holes are, I'm making an assumption. Maybe a more cautious approach is needed.

Another thought: perhaps using a policy that oscillates less and moves directly towards the goal would be better. For example, states on the left side should encourage moving right, and states on the top should encourage moving down.

Let me outline possible actions for each state:

States in row 0 (top row):

- State 0: action 1 (right) or action 2 (down? No, wait action 2 from any state includes up, right, down. Wait no—action 2 is [up, right, down], so from state 0, up is invalid.

Wait, the movement directions for each action are fixed:

- Action 0: [down, left, up]
- Action 1: [right, down, left]
- Action 2: [up, right, down]
- Action 3: [left, up, right]

So for state 0 (top-left), taking action 0 would have possible moves: down to 4, left which is invalid (but perhaps treated as a hole?), or up which is invalid. So maybe it's risky to take action 0 from state 0 because moving left could be a hole.

Alternatively, action 1 for state 0 would move right to 1, down to 4, or left—again, left is risky if it's a hole.

Action 2 for state 0: up (invalid), right to 1, or down to 4. So perhaps action 2 is better because moving left is avoided unless necessary.

Similarly, action 3 for state 0 would move left (hole?), up (invalid), or right to 1.

So from state 0, actions that don't include left might be safer. Therefore, actions 1 and 2 could be better, avoiding left which may lead into a hole.

Therefore, perhaps setting params[0] to action 1 or 2.

Let me consider the goal is at state 15 (bottom-right). So the agent should aim to move towards that.

For states in row 3 (bottom row):

- State 12: can move right to 13, up (to 8), down (invalid).
Wait no—state 12 is bottom-left. Moving down from state 12 would be invalid, so possible moves are right (13), up (8), or left (but that's out of bounds, perhaps a hole).

So action for state 12: if I take action 0, it can move down (invalid, maybe a hole?), left (hole?), or up. So action 0 might be risky.

Alternatively, action 3 from state 12 would move left (invalid), up (to 8), right (to 13). So moving right is good towards the goal, so perhaps action 3 is better for state 12.

Wait, but if the agent takes action 3 in state 12, it can go left (which is out of bounds—probably a hole) with probability 1/3, up to 8 with 1/3, and right to 13 with 1/3. So there's a chance it could fall into a hole by moving left.

Alternatively, maybe action 2 for state 12: which includes up (to 8), right (13), down (invalid). So again, same issue.

Hmm. Maybe the safest way is to minimize movements that can lead to holes. But without knowing where the holes are, it's tricky.

Perhaps a better approach is to design a policy that avoids certain actions in states adjacent to known dangerous areas based on previous trajectories.

Looking at the recent params and their trajectories:

- One trajectory started with (0,3) which might have led into a hole.
- Another had (0,1) leading somewhere else.
- Others had long sequences without reaching the goal.

I think I need to try varying the actions in certain key states to see if it improves the reward. Since all previous rewards are low, I'm in the "Explorer" phase and should choose a new configuration distinct from what's been tried before.

Let me propose a new params where:

- States 0-3 (top row) primarily move down.
- Middle rows move right or down depending on position.
- Bottom row moves right towards state 15.

But considering slipperiness, I need to choose actions that have high probabilities of moving in the desired direction.

For example:

- State 0: action 2 (up, right, down). But up is invalid. So it can move right or down with higher probability.
Wait no—action 2's possible moves are [up, right, down]. From state 0, up is invalid, so the agent would have a 1/3 chance to stay? Or perhaps it's treated as an invalid move and only has two options: right (state 1) and down (state 4). So action 2 from state 0 might effectively have a higher probability of moving right or down.

Alternatively, maybe action 1 for state 0 is better because it includes right, down, left. But if left leads to a hole, then it's risky.

Hmm, this is getting complicated without knowing the exact holes. Maybe I should focus on ensuring that from each state, at least one of the possible actions leads towards the goal, and minimizes the chance of falling into holes.

Given that, perhaps setting up a policy where:

- From even-numbered states (0,2,4,...), take action 1.
- From odd-numbered states, take action 3.

But I'm not sure if this would work. Alternatively, perhaps using a simple right and down approach, like always moving towards the bottom-right.

Wait, another idea: for each state, select the action that has the highest chance of moving towards the goal. For example:

- States in row i, column j: prefer actions that move towards (i+1, j) or (i, j+1).

But considering slipperiness, I need to pick actions that have movement probabilities towards those directions.

Alternatively, perhaps using a greedy approach where each state's action is chosen based on the direction of the goal relative to its position.

Wait, let me think about each state's possible transitions for each action:

For example, in state 0 (top-left):

- Action 0: down (state4), left (invalid—maybe hole), up (invalid).
- Action 1: right (state1), down (state4), left (hole?).
- Action 2: up (invalid), right (state1), down (state4).
- Action 3: left (hole?), up (invalid), right (state1).

So if action 0 from state 0 has a possibility of moving to a hole on the left, it's risky. Similarly for action 1 and 3.

Action 2 might be safer because it doesn't include left unless it's invalid. But in this case, up is invalid, so action 2 would have moves: right (state1) and down (state4), each with probability 1/2 (since one option is invalid). So taking action 2 from state0 gives a 50% chance to move towards the goal.

Alternatively, if I take action1 from state0, it has a 1/3 chance to move left into a hole. That's worse than action2 which only has right and down as valid moves.

Therefore, perhaps setting params[0] = 2 would be better.

Similarly, for other states:

- State1: possible actions that move towards the goal without leading into holes.
- For state1 (top-middle), moving right to state2 or down to state5 could be better. So which action allows those?

Action 1 for state1: moves right (state2), down (state5), left (state0). If left is safe, then it's okay. But if left is a hole, then this action is risky.

Alternatively, action3 for state1: moves left (state0), up (invalid), right (state2). Again, if moving left from state1 leads to a hole, that's bad.

So maybe action2 for state1: [up (invalid), right (state2), down (state5)]. So from state1, action2 allows the agent to move right or down with higher probability. That seems safer.

Wait, but in this case, up is invalid, so it's not a hole. So moving right or down would be valid and towards the goal. Therefore, setting params[1] = 2 might be better.

Continuing this way for each state, choosing actions that avoid left movements (assuming they lead to holes) and move towards the bottom-right.

But I'm making an assumption here about the hole locations—holes are likely on the left or top edges, but not necessarily. Without knowing, it's a gamble.

Alternatively, perhaps focusing on states in the middle, ensuring they move right or down.

For example:

- States 0: action2 (right and down)
- State1: action2 (right and down)
- State2: action3 (left, up, right)—wait, that might not be good. Maybe better to have state2 take action0 (down, left, up). But if moving left is a hole, then it's risky.

Alternatively, for states in the middle rows, choose actions that move down or right.

Wait, this is getting too vague without knowing the hole locations.

Given that all previous attempts yield low rewards, I need to try something different. Perhaps setting a policy where most states move towards the goal and only certain critical states are adjusted.

Looking at the recent params:

- The last four had f(params) around 0.05 or lower, which is worse than the initial attempts. So maybe changing multiple parameters could help.

I think I'll propose a new set of params that systematically moves the agent towards the goal while avoiding left movements unless necessary.

Let me try setting:

- For even-numbered states (0,2,4,...), set action1.
- For odd-numbered states (1,3,5,...), set action3.

But let's see what each action does in these cases.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to have all states move right or down, using actions that facilitate this. For example:

- States where moving down is towards the goal: take action0.
- Where moving right is better: take action1.

Wait, but considering slipperiness, each action might not lead directly there.

Alternatively, perhaps setting a policy where from each state, the agent tries to move in the direction that gets it closer to 15 as much as possible.

For example:

- From states above row3, prefer moving down.
- From states left of column3, prefer moving right.

But without knowing hole positions, this is speculative.

Given the time constraints and the need to propose a new params array, I'll take an educated guess based on avoiding left movements where possible and encouraging movement towards the goal.

So here's my proposed params:

params[0] = 2 (action2: up, right, down. From state0, up is invalid, so it moves right or down)
params[1] = 2 (action2: up, right, down. From state1, up is invalid, so right or down)
...
Wait, but I need to do this for all states.

Alternatively, perhaps setting a consistent action across all states, like always take action3 which includes left, up, right—though that might not be ideal for all.

No, better to think per state:

- State0: action2 (right and down)
- State1: action2 (right and down)
- State2: action2 or 3
Wait, this is getting too time-consuming without a clear model.

Given the time I've spent, perhaps I'll propose a params where most states take action1 or 3 to encourage movement towards the goal while avoiding left as much as possible.
