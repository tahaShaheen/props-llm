You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to find the global optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment in this programming problem. Let's break down what I know and what steps I need to take.

First, the environment is a 4x4 grid where each state represents a cell on the grid. The agent can move left, right, up, or down. The goal is to reach the state 15 (the bottom-right corner), which gives a reward of +1, and all other states give a reward of 0. There are some holes in the map that end the game if stepped on, meaning once the agent steps into a hole, it stays there.

The policy is represented by an array of parameters, each corresponding to an action when the agent is in a particular state. The values are either 0, 1, 2, or 3. Each parameter's value determines which action to take from that state. For example, params[0] is the action to take when in state 0.

The goal is to find the optimal policy, meaning it should maximize the expected reward over time without falling into any holes. The global optimal reward should be as high as possible, ideally around None if not achievable through local optima.

Looking at the examples provided, I see that some policies yield a reward of 1.00 and others lower. For instance, one policy ends up with f(params) = 0.25 or 0.15, which are worse than the best case. This suggests that the current approach isn't sufficient.

I need to explore all possible values for each parameter (0, 1, 2, 3) and find the combination that maximizes the expected reward. The key is to exploit promising states without getting stuck in holes.

The agent should avoid previously seen parameters and focus on exploring new ones that might lead to better rewards. Since the environment has some deterministic transitions (due to the slippery nature of actions), I need to explore each state's possible next moves while considering future rewards.

I'll consider a systematic approach where for each parameter, I test all four values until I find one that performs best on average. However, with 4 parameters and each having four possibilities, there are only 64 combinations to test. This is manageable manually or with a script.

But given the complexity of evaluating each combination without actually simulating the agent's behavior, perhaps using an iterative approach where each iteration tests different parameter values based on performance can lead me closer to the optimal solution.

I'll start by hypothesizing some parameters and testing their performance. For example, if params[0] = 2, it suggests taking action 2 when in state 0 (which is moving up). I need to see how this affects the path toward the goal without entering any holes.

After each simulation run for a certain number of steps, I'll calculate the average reward obtained. If a parameter set yields a higher reward on average, I'll keep it; otherwise, discard it and try others.

I should also consider that some actions might lead to cycles or dead ends if not handled properly. Therefore, ensuring the policy is robust against such possibilities is crucial. This means checking for possible transitions that could trap the agent in a hole without any reward being applied.

Testing each parameter individually and considering their combined effects on different states will be key. For instance, adjusting params[1] affects multiple actions (down, left, right), so changes here can impact both immediate rewards and future steps.

Once I have a candidate policy that shows good performance, I should perform more iterations to see if it converges to a higher reward or discover even better options without revisiting parameters that don't improve the result. This iterative improvement will help me approach the global optimal solution effectively.
