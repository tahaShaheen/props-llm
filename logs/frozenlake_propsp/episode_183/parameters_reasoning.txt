You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to help find the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment using a global optimizer. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward of reaching state 15 (the bottom right corner) while avoiding holes on the map.

First, I'll start by understanding the problem. The agent is in a 4x4 grid, and it can move in four directions. The policy is represented as an array where each element corresponds to a state (0-15), and each value is an action (0-3). Each action has equal probability if certain conditions are met.

The episodes are based on the number of times each state is visited, which encourages the agent to explore more states over time. This way, it doesn't get stuck in local optima but instead focuses on discovering better policies through history.

I'm considering how to approach this systematically. Since the policy space has 4^16 possible parameters (since there are 16 states), it's a high-dimensional space. However, given that each action can take multiple steps with equal probability unless constrained by the environment, perhaps certain patterns emerge as optimal.

The recent best performing policies seem to focus heavily on actions that lead towards more promising regions of the state space. For example, some policies have 3 as the first action (down), which is frequently suggested but leads to a hole in one of the examples. This might indicate that while moving down is common, it's not always optimal.

Looking at another policy with parameters [2:1, 0:3, 3:1], this suggests taking right when on the top row (action 1), up or left otherwise. It avoids holes by exploring around them, which could be beneficial.

I need to balance exploration and exploitation. If the agent is frequently in a state near a hole, it might exploit those states more while still exploring others to find better policies. However, sometimes exploiting certain areas too much can lead to getting stuck if not careful.

Considering the options from the recent best policies, one of them has parameters [2:3, 0:1, 2:1]. This means on state 0 (top-left), action 2 (up) is taken most of the time. But in another example, taking action 2 reduces the reward because it leads to a hole, so perhaps that's a bad strategy.

Wait, but if the agent frequently visits states near holes via some policies, maybe that indicates it's exploring too much there and not getting good rewards. So, perhaps this policy could be a candidate for exploration while still taking advantage of known good paths.

Another thought: since the reward is 0 except when on the goal state (15), which gives +1. The agent should prioritize reaching 15 as quickly as possible. This suggests that taking action 3 (left) from some states could be beneficial, but without holes in other areas, it might prefer avoiding certain paths.

I think a good approach is to explore moving down frequently on the top row when possible, move up elsewhere, and take left or right where necessary. But I need to test this with the optimizer's exploration strategy.

Given that each action has equal probability if conditions are met, the optimizer might balance between exploiting known good actions and exploring other paths to find better policies. So, maybe a mixed strategy where some states take more common actions while others exploit holes or areas not yet explored.

Finally, I'll consider the recent best performing policy with parameters [2:3, 0:1, 2:1], which suggests taking action 2 most of the time on state 0. This might lead to a consistent exploration strategy that helps in finding better policies without favoring holes too much.
