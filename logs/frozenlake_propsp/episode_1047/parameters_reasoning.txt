You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the best possible policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to maximize the reward by reaching state 15, which gives +1, while avoiding holes that end the episode with 0 reward.

First, let's understand the environment. It's a 4x4 grid, states 0-3 are top row, then 4-7, 8-11, and 12-15 at the bottom. The agent can move in four directions, but due to slipperiness, each action leads to three possible next states with equal probability.

The policy is a function that maps each state (0-15) to an action (0-3). My task is to find the optimal set of actions for each state to maximize the reward.

Looking at the provided data, the best performing policies have an average reward around 0.45. The goal is to reach close to 1.0, which suggests we're not yet optimal.

In the most recent attempts, some parameters led to very low rewards (0.00), possibly because they fell into holes repeatedly. So, I need to adjust the policy to avoid such traps and find paths that reliably reach state 15.

Looking at the trajectories:

- Some policies get stuck in loops, like moving between states without progressing towards the goal.
- Others fall into holes after a few steps, indicating risky moves are being taken.

I should focus on actions that increase the likelihood of moving towards state 15. For example, right and down actions (actions 0 and 1) might be more direct paths depending on the current state.

Let me think about each state:

- State 0: Top-left corner. Possible moves are down, left, up. But since it's a corner, moving left or up would go out of bounds, so it should try to move down.
- Similarly, states near the edges have limited safe movements.

I need to define for each state which action(s) will best navigate towards 15 while avoiding holes.

From previous trials, some policies successfully moved from 0 to 1 (state 1), but then might not proceed further. So maybe adjusting the actions in these early states can help.

Let me consider setting up a policy where:

- States near the goal (like 12) should move right or down.
- Middle states should have a mix of right and down movements to navigate towards the bottom-right.

I'll try to assign for each state an action that pushes the agent closer to 15. Also, considering slipperiness, the policy needs to be robust enough to handle the probabilistic movement.

Perhaps setting params[0] to move right (action 1) or down (action 0). Let me check previous successful moves. In earlier examples, when params[0] was 1, it moved to state 1. Then, if params[1] is set correctly, maybe the agent can proceed further.

But in some cases, moving right from state 0 could lead to a hole, so I need to ensure that for each state, the action chosen doesn't lead into a hole with high probability.

Looking at the holes, I think they are placed at certain states. From previous trajectories, when the agent moved from state 1 (top second grid) to state 4, which is in the second row, but if there's a hole, that could be problematic.

Wait, perhaps I should map out all possible states and their adjacent holes to determine safe paths.

Assuming the holes are at states like 5, 7, etc., but without exact info, it's tricky. However, based on trajectories, certain moves led to falls. So, for example, if from state 1 (0,1), moving down leads to state 4 or others, which might be a hole.

Therefore, the policy needs to avoid actions that could lead into holes. For instance, in states adjacent to holes, choose actions that move away.

I think the optimal policy would have each state choose an action that maximizes the chance of moving towards 15 while minimizing risk of falling into holes.

Given all this, I'll propose a new set of parameters where:

- From start (0), move down (action 0).
- From states in row 0, try to move down.
- In middle rows, prefer right and down movements.
- Near the goal, choose actions that get closer.

But without exact hole positions, it's challenging. So I'll aim for a policy that pushes towards the bottom-right as much as possible.

Let me create a tentative params array where:

params[0] = 1 (right)
params[1] = 3 (up? Maybe not; perhaps down is better)
Wait, no, from state 1 (top second), moving right would go to state 2, but if that's a hole... Alternatively, move down.

Alternatively, maybe set params[0]=3 to try moving up, left, or right. But since state 0 can only move down safely, perhaps action 0 is better.

Hmm, I'm getting confused. Maybe looking at previous successful policies can help.

Looking back, the top policy had f(params)=0.45 with specific actions. Perhaps tweaking those slightly could improve performance.

Alternatively, try randomizing some states to explore new paths.

Since the average reward is still low (0.45), I'm in the exploration phase as per the strategy. So I should propose a new set of params that's different from previous ones but explores new trajectories.

I'll change several parameters across the array, ensuring they're not repeating any from the top 5 or recent attempts.
