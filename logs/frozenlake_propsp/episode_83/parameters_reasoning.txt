You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the environment is a 4x4 grid where each state corresponds to a specific position. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) and get a reward of +1. All other states give 0 except for the holes, which end the episode with no reward but also make the agent lose.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 numbers, each corresponding to an action from 0 to 3 for each state. The tricky part is that the environment is slippery, so each action taken has a probability of moving in three directions instead of just one. This makes planning more complicated because we can't rely on a single outcome when taking an action.

Looking at the top 5 best-performing policies provided, all have an average reward around 0.10, which is quite low. Since our goal is to reach a global optimal reward close to 1.0, we need to explore more effective strategies.

The recent two policies also didn't perform well, with rewards of 0.05 and 0.00. This suggests that the current approaches aren't leading the agent towards the goal efficiently or are causing it to fall into holes frequently.

Since the rewards are still low, I should act as an Explorer, trying out new configurations rather than tweaking existing ones. The key is to find a policy that navigates the grid effectively while avoiding holes.

I need to think about how each state should behave. For example, in state 0 (top-left), which action would help reach the goal without falling into a hole? Similarly, for other states like 15 (the goal), we might want to stay there or not move, but that's just a thought.

Wait, actually, once you reach state 15, you get the reward, so maybe staying in place isn't helpful. The agent should try to navigate towards it.

But considering the slippery nature, taking actions that have a higher chance of moving closer to the goal would be better. For instance, from state 0, moving right or down could lead towards the goal. However, due to the slipperiness, these actions might not always result in the intended move.

I should consider each state and map it to an action that has the highest probability of eventually leading towards state 15 without stepping into a hole. Maybe using some heuristic-based approach where certain directions are more favorable from specific states.

Looking at the grid layout, holes are present in certain positions, but their exact locations aren't specified here. From the trajectories provided, I can infer that some paths lead to holes. For example, taking action 0 from state 0 leads to (4,2), which is safe, but another trajectory led to (1,3) and then fell into a hole.

So, the idea is to choose actions that minimize the risk of falling into holes while maximizing the chance of reaching state 15. This might involve creating a path that avoids known dangerous areas and progresses towards the goal.

I think I need to create a policy where each state's action leads the agent closer to the goal, considering all possible slippery outcomes. For example, from state 0, choosing right (action 1) would have the agent try to move right, but due to slipperiness, it could end up moving down or up as well. I need to see which of these has a higher chance of leading towards the goal without hitting a hole.

Alternatively, perhaps using a more systematic approach like BFS to determine the optimal path from each state to the goal, considering the slippery transitions. But since I don't have the exact hole positions, it's challenging.

Given that all previous policies have low rewards, maybe the problem is that they aren't effectively navigating towards the goal or are getting stuck in loops or falling into holes too often.

I should propose a policy where each state directs the agent towards the goal as much as possible. For example:

- States closer to the goal (like 12, 13, 14, 15) should take actions that keep them moving right or down.
- Middle states might need to move in directions that can reach these target states.

But without knowing where the holes are, it's hard. So perhaps a better approach is to choose actions that have a higher probability of leading towards the goal and avoiding areas with high hole density.

Looking at the recent trajectories, some ended up taking too many steps or fell into holes after moving in certain directions. Maybe adjusting the actions for states near the top or left to push more towards the right or down.

I'll try to create a policy where each state's action is chosen to move towards increasing row and column numbers as much as possible, given the slippery nature.

For example:

- For state 0 (top-left), taking action 3 (right) might help move towards the goal.
- For states along the top row, moving right or down could be beneficial.
- Similarly, for states in the leftmost column, moving down or right would help.

But I need to ensure that these actions don't lead into holes. Since all previous policies have low rewards, perhaps their actions are causing too many falls. So maybe choosing different actions for certain states where they were previously failing.

I think a possible approach is to vary the actions across the states more, trying out different combinations to see which ones avoid holes and reach the goal.

Given that, I'll propose a new set of parameters where each state's action is set to maximize progression towards the goal while considering the slipperiness. For example:

- Set params[0] to 3 (right) to start moving towards the right.
- For other states in the top row, set actions to move right or down as appropriate.
- Similarly, for leftmost column states, set actions to move down.

But without knowing hole positions, it's a bit of a gamble. However, given that all previous policies are underperforming, trying new configurations is necessary.

After considering these factors, I'll propose the following params configuration:

params[0]: 3, params[1]: 2, params[2]: 1, params[3]: 0, params[4]: 3, params[5]: 2, params[6]: 1, params[7]: 0, params[8]: 3, params[9]: 2, params[10]: 1, params[11]: 0, params[12]: 3, params[13]: 2, params[14]: 1, params[15]: 3
