You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out the best strategy for this FrozenLake environment. So, from what I understand, the agent starts at position 0 and needs to reach the goal state 15 to get a reward of +1. But if it steps into a hole, the game ends, so it has to explore those areas by learning from history.

The policy is represented as an array where each value corresponds to the action (0-3) when in that state. The values are chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3], but they should ideally be [0, 1, 2, 3]. Since we don't want to get stuck and instead exploit only if beneficial, I need to ensure my policy is set up correctly.

Looking at the examples provided, each params array has values that try different actions in different states. For instance, some have 0, others 1, etc., which likely correspond to moving left, right, down, or up. The goal is to make sure the agent doesn't fall into any holes and efficiently navigates from start to finish.

I also notice that most of the example parameters give a reward of around 1, but some are slightly lower. Since we're using an episodic reward model, I need to think about how the learning algorithm will update its policy based on these rewards.

Given the slippery environment, each action choice has equal probability when it's selected. That means if the agent takes action 0 (down), it'll choose among moving down, left, or up equally. The same goes for other actions—each of their options is equally likely regardless of which one they are taking.

I should also consider that the policy needs to avoid the hole states where stepping on them would end the game. So, perhaps the policy needs to prioritize exploring certain paths and exploiting others based on the reward function.

Another thing to think about is whether my initial policy might have some biases or suboptimal choices. For example, if action 2 (up) is chosen more often than action 0 (down), maybe I need to adjust that towards exploration when near holes to avoid falling into them.

I also recall that in such environments, a good approach is to use an epsilon-greedy strategy where the agent sometimes explores by choosing random actions instead of sticking with the current policy. But since our parameter values are already [0,1,2,3], perhaps I don't need to change the exploration rate but just ensure it's high enough without overexploring.

Looking back at the examples, many have varying action choices in different states. It seems like each state has a unique path that might be optimal for that position. For instance, starting at 0 (top-left), the optimal move is probably to go down or left, avoiding the hole which is likely at (3,0) if I'm not mistaken.

I should also think about how the learning algorithm processes the information from each interaction. If it's a Q-learning approach, each state-action pair receives a reward and updates accordingly. Since the environment is episodic, the reward for each action taken depends on whether it leads to the goal or falls into a hole.

In summary, my plan is to set up the policy with values in [0-3] as per the examples provided but ensuring that actions are chosen based on current states without prioritizing any. I might also consider adjusting the parameters during training to see which ones perform better in avoiding holes and efficiently reaching the goal.
