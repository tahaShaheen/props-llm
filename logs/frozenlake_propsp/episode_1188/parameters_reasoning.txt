You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help optimize the policy for this FrozenLake environment. It's a 4x4 grid where the agent moves around, and the goal is to reach state 15 with a reward of +1. The environment is slippery, meaning each action has three possible outcomes with equal probability. There are also holes that end the episode if stepped on.

First, I need to understand how the policy works. The policy is defined by an array called params, where each element corresponds to a state (0-15) and determines which action to take from that state. The actions are 0, 1, 2, or 3, each leading to different movement probabilities.

The goal is to find the global optimal policy that maximizes the reward, ideally around 1.0. From the given examples, it seems like some policies have f(params) around 0.35-0.45, which isn't very high yet. So, I need to figure out how to tweak these params to get closer to 1.

Looking at the recent trajectories and rewards, most are below 0.4, indicating that we're in an exploratory phase since the rewards aren't close to 1.0. According to the strategy, when rewards are low, I should focus on exploration rather than exploitation. This means proposing new parameter configurations that haven't been tried before to gather more information about which actions lead to success or failure.

In the top 5 best-performing params, most of them have a mix of actions, but they might not be avoiding holes effectively. For example, in state 0 (top-left corner), some are choosing action 1 or 2, which could lead the agent towards moving right or down with some probability. But if that leads into a hole, the episode ends without reaching the goal.

I need to think about how each state's action choice affects the overall path. Maybe certain states should always choose an action that moves towards the goal while avoiding holes. For example, from state 0 (top-left), moving right or down could be safer depending on where the holes are located.

Since I don't have exact information about which states are holes, I need to infer based on trajectories. If an agent falls into a hole, it's likely that their last action led them there. For instance, in one of the recent trajectories, starting at state 0 with action 2 (which could move up, right, or down), the agent went to state 4 and then back to 0 repeatedly, suggesting maybe some loops.

To avoid getting stuck, perhaps the policy should encourage actions that lead towards the goal without unnecessary risks. For example, in states near the bottom-right corner, it's better to choose actions that move closer to 15. In other areas, steering clear of known risky moves would help.

I should consider making changes to certain critical states. For instance, state 0: maybe action 2 (right or down) is good. State 1: perhaps action 3 (left, up, right), which might avoid going left into a hole. But without knowing the exact holes, it's tricky.

Another approach is to look for symmetry in the grid. If moving right from state 0 leads towards the goal, while moving down takes you away, then preferring right might be better. However, since movement is probabilistic due to slipperiness, choosing actions that increase the chance of moving towards the goal without falling into holes is key.

Given the recent params tried, maybe I should change some of the action choices in critical states like 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on. For example, changing state 4's action from 0 to something else might help avoid getting stuck in loops or moving away from the goal.

I also need to ensure that each proposed set of params is unique and hasn't been tried before. Looking at the previous examples, many have similar structures, especially in the initial states. So, varying these could provide new data points.

Finally, since it's iteration 1188 out of 5000, there's still time to explore more thoroughly before settling into optimization. Proposing a param set that slightly varies from the current best but introduces some changes might help discover a better reward.
