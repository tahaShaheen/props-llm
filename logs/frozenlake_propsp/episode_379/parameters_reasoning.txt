You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I need to help find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get the highest possible reward, which should be around 1.0. Let me think through how to approach this.

First, let's understand the environment. It's a 4x4 grid with states numbered from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). The agent can move in four directions, but because of the slippery nature, each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability. The challenge is to avoid holes and reach state 15.

Looking at the problem statement, I see that we're given some previous policies and their rewards. The top-performing ones have an average reward of around 0.25, which is much lower than the target of 1.0. This suggests that there's a lot of room for improvement and perhaps the current policies are not reaching the goal consistently.

The user provided recent policies with low rewards (like 0.00 or 0.10), so I'm in the "explorer" phase because the rewards aren't close to optimal yet. My goal now is to maximize information gain by suggesting a new set of parameters that haven't been tried before, which might lead us closer to the optimal solution.

I remember that the best strategy in such grid worlds often involves moving towards the goal while avoiding dangerous states (holes). Since state 15 is the target, I should design policies that push the agent towards higher-numbered states, especially when possible. But due to the slippery nature, direct paths might not be reliable, so perhaps a more cautious approach is needed.

Looking at previous attempts, many of them seem to have loops or get stuck in certain areas. For example, some trajectories show repeated actions leading to no progress. To break this, I need policies that can navigate more effectively towards the goal.

Let me consider how each state's policy choice affects movement. For instance:

- In state 0 (top-left), choosing action 2 (up) might not make sense because it's already at the top. Instead, moving right or down could be better.
- Similarly, in state 15, we want to stay there once reached, so setting its policy to any action that keeps it in place might help.

I should map each state to actions that generally move towards higher-numbered states but avoid risky moves. For example, preferring right and down actions where possible. However, due to the slippery nature, these actions might lead elsewhere, so I need a balance between exploration and exploitation.

Looking at previous policies, many have action 0 or 1 for certain states. Maybe trying different combinations could help. Let me think of setting some states to specific actions that push towards the goal more effectively.

I also notice that in state 3 (which is the end of the first row), moving right leads to state 4, which is in the second row. So perhaps for state 3, choosing action 2 (up) might not be ideal; instead, action 1 (right or others) could help move forward.

Given all this, I'll design a new set of parameters where each state's policy is set to an action that generally moves towards higher-numbered states, avoiding loops. For example:

- States in the top row: encourage moving down or right.
- Middle rows: prioritize moving down or right as well, but considering their position.

I need to make sure all params are from 0-3 and haven't been used before. Let me outline some tentative choices:

- For states closer to the goal (like higher numbers), set policies that don't risk stepping into holes. Maybe action 2 or 3 for certain states.
- Ensure that each state's policy doesn't lead to immediate loops; for example, if a state tends to stay in place or cycle with others.

I think setting params such that most states move towards right or down could be beneficial. For instance:

params[0] = 1 (right)
params[1] = 2 (up might not help here, so perhaps another action)
Wait, no—if the agent is at state 1 (top-middle), moving up isn't possible, but moving right would take it to state 2 or other states. Alternatively, maybe action 3 for some states.

This is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should look for patterns in optimal policies. Typically, the optimal policy tends to move towards the goal with as few steps as possible while avoiding holes. So perhaps setting each state's policy to an action that would ideally lead closer to the goal, but considering the slippery nature.

Given that the environment is slippery, it's hard to predict exact paths, so a more flexible approach might be needed, like ensuring that the agent has multiple pathways to the goal and avoids areas with holes.

Since I'm in the exploration phase, I'll propose a new set of parameters that are distinct from previous ones. Let me assign each state an action that generally moves towards higher states without getting stuck:

- For example, even numbers might move right (action 1 or 3), while odd numbers move down (action 0). But I need to ensure this makes sense across the grid.

Alternatively, perhaps a more uniform approach where most states have policies that allow movement either right or down, depending on their position. For instance:

- Top row: prefer moving right and down.
- Middle rows: prefer moving down and right as well, but considering their current position.

Wait, I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe just setting all policies to action 2 except for some key states. Or perhaps using a combination of actions that allow the agent to move towards the goal while having some flexibility.

After thinking through, I think the best approach is to assign each state an action that pushes it towards higher-numbered states (right and down) as much as possible, considering their current position. This should maximize the chance of reaching the goal without falling into holes.

So, I'll propose a new set where most states have policies that move right or down. For example:

- States in the top row: action 1 (which includes moving right)
- Middle rows: action 2 or 3 to move towards the bottom-right.

I need to make sure each state's policy is unique from previous ones and covers all possibilities without repetition.
