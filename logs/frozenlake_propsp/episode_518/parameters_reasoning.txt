You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out the best policy for the FrozenLake environment based on the information provided. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) without falling into any holes. The environment is slippery, meaning each action has a 33% chance of going in one of three directions. 

First, I need to understand the structure of the environment. It's a 4x4 grid with states numbered from 0 to 15. The top row is 0-3, then 4-7, 8-11, and finally 12-15 at the bottom. Holes are present in some states, but their exact locations aren't specified here. However, from the trajectories provided, I can infer where the holes might be by looking at the failed attempts.

Looking at the most recent policies and their rewards, it seems that many of them are getting stuck or falling into holes. For example, one policy with all actions set to 2 (except some states) resulted in a reward of 0.30 but still didn't reach the goal. Another had a reward of 0.10 and ended up moving around without success.

I notice that in the most recent policies, some states have specific actions that might be leading towards holes. For instance, state 0 is often set to action 2 (up), which from state 0 would move it back to itself or somewhere else, possibly a hole. Maybe changing this action could help avoid such loops.

Also, considering the slippery nature, the policy should account for all possible directions each action can take. For example, if an agent is in state 1 and takes action 3 (right), there's a chance it might move left instead, which could lead to a hole. Therefore, choosing actions that minimize falling into holes while increasing the probability of moving towards the goal is crucial.

Looking at the best-performing policies so far, they have varying actions but seem to prioritize moving down or right when possible. However, their rewards are still below 1.0, indicating room for improvement.

To maximize information gain, I should propose a policy that explores new areas without repeating previous configurations. Maybe changing some key states' actions could lead the agent towards the goal more effectively. For example, setting state 8 (top-left of the third row) to action 2 (up) instead of another action might help navigate better.

I'll consider each state and decide which action would best avoid holes and move closer to the goal. For instance, in state 15, it's already the goal, so any action is irrelevant, but since it's the end, perhaps setting it to a default like 3 or something else doesn't matter. 

I'll also ensure that the policy avoids repeating previous configurations. The most recent policies have certain patterns, so I should shuffle some actions in key states to explore different paths.

After thinking through these factors, I propose the following policy:

params[0]:1, params[1]:3, params[2]:3, params[3]:0, params[4]:2, params[5]:3, params[6]:3, params[7]:0, params[8]:2, params[9]:1, params[10]:3, params[11]:0, params[12]:2, params[13]:1, params[14]:3, params[15]:3
</think>

params[0]:1, params[1]:3, params[2]:3, params[3]:0, params[4]:2, params[5]:3, params[6]:3, params[7]:0, params[8]:2, params[9]:1, params[10]:3, params[11]:0, params[12]:2, params[13]:1, params[14]:3, params[15]:3
