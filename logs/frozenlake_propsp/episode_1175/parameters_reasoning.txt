You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with the highest possible reward, avoiding the holes along the way. The agent can move in four directions, but because of the slippery nature, each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability.

Looking at the problem statement, I know that the policy is a function mapping each state (from 0 to 15) to an action (0-3). The reward is averaged over 20 episodes for each policy. My task is to propose new policies in each iteration, trying to maximize the reward.

In the provided data, there are several top-performing params with rewards around 0.35-0.45. However, none have reached the optimal reward of 1.0 yet. The most recent five params all had low rewards (mostly 0 or 0.00), so I'm in the exploration phase since the rewards are far below 1.0.

I need to explore new policies that haven't been tried before to gather more information about which states lead to holes and which path is safe to reach the goal. The current top params seem to have some consistency, but they're not effective enough. Maybe I should vary actions in critical states where previous attempts failed or didn't progress.

Looking at state 15, it's clear that once reached, the reward is +1, so the policy for state 15 should be irrelevant since the episode ends upon reaching it. But all other states need careful handling to avoid holes and navigate correctly.

I should consider modifying actions in states where previous policies didn't successfully reach the goal. For example, if many trajectories end early because of falling into a hole from a certain state, changing the action there might help.

Let me think about the structure of the grid. The agent starts at 0 (top-left) and needs to get to 15 (bottom-right). Common sense tells me that moving right or down towards the goal is usually better. But due to the slippery nature, sometimes other actions are needed to avoid holes.

In the top-performing params, state 0 often takes action 1 (right), which makes sense as it moves towards the goal. However, maybe trying a different action in state 0 could lead to a safer path. Similarly, states near the edges or holes should have cautious policies.

Perhaps I can create a policy where from each state, the agent tries to move towards the goal but with some variation to explore new paths. For example, if previous attempts failed by taking right too often, maybe switching to down in certain states could avoid holes.

I also notice that some trajectories loop or get stuck, so the policies might need better exploration strategies. Maybe adding more variability in actions for certain states can help break out of loops and find a safer path.

Since I'm in the exploration phase, I'll try a completely new set of actions, ensuring it's different from all previous params to gather as much information as possible. For example, changing state 0's action to down (action 3) might lead the agent towards the bottom row, which could be safer or riskier depending on where the holes are.

I need to make sure that the new policy doesn't repeat any of the previous ones and covers a different path. Let me try constructing such a policy step by step for each state.

After considering all this, I'll propose a new set of params where each state's action is chosen with the aim to move towards the goal while exploring alternative paths to avoid known holes.
