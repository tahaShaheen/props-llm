You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment that's getting slippery. The problem statement says it's a 4x4 grid where each state can move in four directions with equal probability except when taking specific actions which give different probabilities.

First, let me understand the environment better. The states are numbered from 0 to 15, corresponding to positions (row, column) on a 4x4 grid. The goal is to reach state 15, which is the bottom right corner. All other states give +0 reward, except when stepping into the hole on row 3 (states 9 or 12), where you get a -1 reward because it ends the game.

The policy function takes in 4x4 = 16 parameters, each representing an action for a specific state. The actions are numbered from 0 to 3, with each parameter corresponding to one of these actions across all states. When taking an action (like action 0), the agent has three possible moves: down, left, or up, each with equal probability.

My goal is to find the set of parameters that maximizes the expected reward over time. I've been told that the global optimal reward should be around None, meaning it's not known beforehand but can be found through exploration and exploitation.

The policy is a function f(params), which returns an action for each state. The params array is structured such that params[0] is the action for state 0, params[1] for state 1, etc., up to params[15].

I need to figure out what values of these parameters would lead the policy to explore all possible states and avoid getting stuck in any holes, aiming for a path from (0,0) to (3,3).

Looking at the examples provided, some policies are better than others. For instance, one starts with action 2 (up), which is good because it can reach nearby states, while another starts with action 1 (right or down). The best ones, like params[0]: 2 and params[1]:3, seem to have higher rewards.

I should try to find a policy that tries different paths but doesn't get stuck in the hole. Maybe starting by taking action 2 first (up) is better because it can go back and forth easily. Then from state 2, trying to move down or right might be safer.

Let me think about each state's optimal action:

- State 0: Can take actions 1, 2, 3.
  - Action 0 (left): leads to a hole.
  - Action 1: next is state 4.
  - Action 2: up, back to state 0.
  - So likely best to take action 3 (right), but taking action 3 from state 0 might get stuck.

Wait, no. From state 0, if I take action 3 (right), that's correct. If I take action 1 or 2, it loops back and forth.

But in the examples given, params[0]: 2 gives better rewards because it starts by moving up. Let me see why.

From state 0:
- Action 2: move up to state 8.
- From state 8: possible actions are down (back to 4), right (state 15, goal), left (state 6).

So from state 8, best action is right. But if I take action 3 (left) from state 0, would that lead me into a hole?

From state 0:
- Action 3: move left to state 4.
- From state 4: possible actions are down (back to 1), up (up to state 2 or state 0?), wait no. Wait, let's see:

Actually, in the grid:

State 0 is top-left.

From state 4 (down of 0):
- Action 3 would move left, which from row 1, column 3 (since rows are numbered 0 to 3), so left to column 2, which is state 2.
Wait, columns are 0 to 3. So row 1, column 3 is state 4.

So from state 4:
- Action 3: move left to column 2 (state 2).

From state 2 (which is up of 0):
- Actions can go down (back to 5?), wait no:

Wait, perhaps I need to reindex. Let me clarify the grid mapping.

The states are from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). The numbering should be row-wise, so rows 0 and 1, columns 0 and 1; then rows 2 and 3, etc.

So:

State 0: top-left.
State 1: (0,1).
State 2: (1,0) [up from 0? No, up from 0 would be row -1, which doesn't exist. So perhaps the numbering is such that row increases as you go down. So state 0 is (0,0), state 1 is (0,1), state 2 is (1,0) [up from 0], etc.

Wait no, that's not correct because moving up from (0,0) would take you to (-1,0), which doesn't exist. So perhaps the states are arranged such that row increases as you go down and column as well.

So:

Row 0: columns 0 (state 0), 1 (state 1).
Row 1: columns 2 (state 2), 3 (state 3).
Row 2: columns 4 (state 4), 5 (state 5).
Row 3: columns 6 (state 6), 7 (state 7).

Wait, that might not align correctly. Alternatively, perhaps row numbers increase downward.

In any case, it's crucial to understand the movement from each state.

But given time constraints and the fact that I need a policy that maximizes reward, I'll think of using a small search space.

Since the environment is 4x4 with 16 possible states, trying all combinations isn't feasible, but maybe using a simple search algorithm like BFS or iterative improvement could help. However, since we're in an episodic setting and need to find the optimal policy through exploration, perhaps starting with action 2 (up) from state 0 is better.

So, I'll start by taking action 2 (up) from state 0, leading back to state 8. From there, take action 3 (left), which in state 8 would be column -1, but probably correct movement would go somewhere else? Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the immediate reward and possible paths.

But given that I can't simulate all possibilities here, I'll proceed with a policy that takes action 2 from state 0 (up), then action 3 from there. That way, it avoids getting stuck in the hole unless forced.
