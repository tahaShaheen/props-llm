You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment using a stateless RL approach. The goal is to get an episodic reward of around 1.0, which means reaching the goal state 15 without falling into any holes.

First, I need to understand the environment better. It's a 4x4 grid with slippery movements. Each action taken by the agent results in moving in one of three directions randomly. The policy is defined by an array of 16 numbers, each representing the action (0-3) for each state (0-15).

Looking at the provided examples and trajectories, I notice that many policies aren't reaching the goal or are getting stuck in loops or holes. For instance, some trajectories end quickly because they fall into holes or don't move towards the goal effectively.

The key is to design a policy that directs the agent towards the goal while avoiding holes as much as possible. Since the environment is slippery, each action has a 33% chance of going in one of three directions. So, the policy needs to choose actions that statistically increase the chances of moving closer to state 15 without stepping on holes.

In the top-performing params example, the agent managed a reward of 0.30, which is better than others but still far from optimal. The trajectories show the agent sometimes moves towards lower states (like 4 and 8), which are further away from 15. Maybe adjusting these actions to move more directly towards the right or down could help.

Looking at recent params, some have reward 0.05 or worse, indicating they're not effective. The most recent policies seem to be getting stuck in loops or not progressing towards the goal. This suggests that I need to explore different strategies to break these loops and move closer to state 15.

Since the environment is slippery, I should consider actions that have a higher probability of moving towards the right or down, which are generally the directions leading towards state 15. For example, in states where the agent is in the top row (0-3), choosing actions that encourage moving right or down might be better.

I also need to ensure that the policy doesn't lead the agent into known holes. From previous trajectories, I can infer which states are dangerous. For instance, certain actions from state 0 might lead to a hole, so the policy should avoid those actions if possible.

To maximize information gain, I should propose a new set of params that haven't been tried before and could potentially reach the goal more effectively. Maybe setting some states to take specific actions that push towards the right or down consistently.

I'll consider changing several key states' actions. For example:

- State 0 (top-left) might benefit from moving right (action 1), which can lead to state 3, closer to the top-right.
- States near the goal (like 12, 13, 14) should be set to move right or down if possible to reach 15.

I'll go through each state and decide the best action that avoids holes and progresses towards the goal. For states in the bottom row (12-15), moving right from 12 would lead directly to 13, which is closer. Similarly, for other rows, choosing actions that move down or right will help.

After considering all these factors, I'll propose a new set of params where each state's action is chosen to statistically increase the chances of reaching the goal without falling into holes.
