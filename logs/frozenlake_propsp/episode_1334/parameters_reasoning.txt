You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the best possible policy for the FrozenLake environment based on the given information. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward, which should ideally be around 1.0 since that's when the agent reaches state 15 without falling into any holes.

First, let me understand the problem setup. The grid is 4x4, with states numbered from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). The environment is slippery, meaning each action has a 33% chance of moving in one of three directions. Holes exist, and stepping on them ends the episode.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 values (params[0] to params[15]), each representing the action taken in that state. The actions are 0,1,2,3 corresponding to different movement options with equal probabilities for each direction.

Looking at the previous attempts and their rewards, it seems most policies are yielding around 0.45 or lower. So, there's definitely room for improvement.

I need to consider how each action in a state affects the next possible states, especially avoiding holes. Since I can't remember past iterations, I have to base my decisions solely on maximizing information gain each time.

To maximize reward, the policy should guide the agent towards the goal (state 15) while avoiding holes. The optimal path likely involves moving right and down as much as possible but with some flexibility due to the slippery nature of the environment.

I recall that in FrozenLake, the standard solution often involves policies that move towards the goal while considering the slippery movement probabilities. For example, starting from state 0 (top-left), taking action 1 (which can lead right, down, or left) might be beneficial because moving right would get closer to the goal.

Looking at previous successful policies, many have params[0] set to 1, which suggests that moving right is a common initial choice. However, I should also consider other actions if they might yield better results.

Now, considering the most recent attempts with low rewards (like 0.20 and 0.00), it's clear that some policies are not effective. The agent needs to avoid getting stuck in loops or falling into holes frequently.

I think a good strategy is to set actions in such a way that they bias the movement towards the goal while having enough variance to explore without falling into holes too often. For example, states near the top and left might benefit from moving down or right, whereas states on the bottom row might need to move up or right carefully.

I should also ensure that the agent doesn't get stuck in cycles. So, actions should be set to eventually lead towards the goal without creating loops.

Given all this, I'll propose a new policy where each state's action is chosen to maximize the probability of moving closer to the goal while avoiding holes as much as possible. For example:

- States near the top might benefit from moving down.
- Middle states could have a mix of right and down actions.
- Rightmost states should push towards the bottom-right.

I'll go through each state (0 to 15) and assign an action that likely leads towards the goal, considering the slippery nature. For instance:

params[0]: move right (action 1)
params[1]: move down (action 0 or 3)
... and so on for each state.

But since I can't plan for future iterations, I have to pick a configuration that's distinct from previous ones and maximizes information gain. So, maybe altering some key states' actions could help discover better trajectories.
