You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let's start by understanding the problem.

The environment is a 4x4 grid where each state is numbered from 0 to 15. The agent can move in four directions—up, down, left, right—but because of the slippery nature, taking an action leads to three possible moves with equal probability. Holes are present which end the episode if stepped on, and the goal is to reach state 15 for a reward of +1.

The policy is defined by params[0] to params[15], each being 0-3 indicating actions. The challenge is to find the optimal set of these parameters that maximizes the average episodic reward.

Looking at the previous attempts and trajectories, it seems like most policies are leading to low rewards (around 0.25 or lower). Since the maximum possible reward is 1.0 when reaching state 15 without falling into a hole, we need a policy that effectively navigates towards the goal while avoiding holes.

I notice that in the top params, some trajectories reach the goal but don't get high rewards, possibly because they're still stepping on holes or taking too long. For example, one trajectory reached state 8 and then went to 2, which might not be optimal.

Since the recent policies aren't performing well, I should focus on exploring new configurations rather than optimizing existing ones that give low rewards. The goal is to maximize information gain by proposing a new set of params that can help determine better directions or identify holes more effectively.

I'll consider setting up policies where each state directs towards the right and down as much as possible since state 15 is at the bottom-right. However, because of the slippery nature, I should choose actions that have a higher probability of moving in the desired direction without leading into holes.

Looking at the grid:

- State 0 (top-left) can go right or down.
- States closer to the goal should push towards state 15.

I'll try setting each state's action to prefer moving towards the right and down. For example, in state 0 (position [0,0]), the best actions are right (action 1) or down (action 0). I need to choose which one is better considering possible hole locations.

But without knowing where the holes are exactly, it's tricky. So perhaps the optimal policy involves a mix of directions to balance between reaching the goal and avoiding traps.

Wait, in the initial setup, each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability. For example, action 0 (left) from state 0 would lead to states that may include moving down or up as well. So maybe choosing certain actions can increase the chances of moving towards the goal without falling into holes.

I think a greedy approach might not work due to the stochastic nature. Instead, an optimal policy should consider all possible paths and choose actions that statistically maximize the chance of reaching the goal without hitting a hole.

Given that previous attempts have low rewards, perhaps the current policies are not effectively navigating towards the goal or are getting stuck in loops. So I need to propose a new set where each state's action is chosen to push towards the right or down as much as possible, while avoiding directions that could lead into known holes.

But without knowing where the holes are, it's hard to make precise decisions. Therefore, to maximize information gain, I should pick actions that explore different paths rather than exploit current knowledge.

Alternatively, perhaps setting each state to always choose an action that would move towards the goal in a straight line if possible. For example, from state 0, moving right (action 1) could lead towards states 1 and then 5, which might be better than going down (state 4). But I'm not sure about the hole locations.

Another approach is to consider that each action leads to three directions, so choosing an action that covers multiple paths can help in exploring different trajectories without getting stuck. For example, choosing action 1 from state 0 allows movement right, down, or left, but since we want to go towards the goal, maybe action 2 (up, right, down) could be better.

Wait, let me check what each action does:

- Action 0: move down, left, up
- Action 1: move right, down, left
- Action 2: move up, right, down
- Action 3: move left, up, right

So from state 0 (top-left), the possible moves are:

- Action 0: could go to state 4 (down) or stay in 0 if moving up (but that's impossible as it's top row; perhaps wraps or stays?), but more likely goes down.
Wait, actually, movement should be within bounds. So from state 0 (row 0, col 0), moving left would loop to the last column of the same row? Or is it invalid?

In OpenAI Gym's FrozenLake, movements that go out of bounds stay in place or perhaps wrap around. But I need to clarify.

Assuming movement is within bounds:

From state 0 (row 0, col 0):
- Action 0: down -> state 4
- Action 1: right -> state 1, down -> state 4, left -> remains 0
But since action 1 has three possible moves, each with probability 1/3.

Similarly, action 2 would allow moving up (invalid, so stays?), but perhaps the movement is clipped to stay within bounds. So from row 0, up doesn't move; same for other edges.

This makes it more complex as some actions may not change the state if moving beyond grid limits.

Given that, to get towards the goal, I want states in higher rows and columns. So, setting each state's action to maximize movement towards right or down would be beneficial.

So perhaps for each state, choose an action that allows maximum progress towards the goal while considering possible hole locations.

But without knowing where holes are, I need a general approach.

Let me try to create a policy where each state directs the agent towards increasing row and column indices. For example:

- States in the top-left (0) should move right or down.
- Middle states should move right or down depending on their position.

Looking at the grid:

States 0-3: top row
States 4-7: second row
States 8-11: third row
States 12-15: bottom row

Columns go from left (0) to right (3).

So, for each state i:

Row = i // 4
Column = i % 4

If column < 3 and not in a hole, prefer moving right; else, prefer down.

But again, without knowing holes, it's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal policy is one that always heads towards the goal regardless of obstacles. So, each state should choose actions that have a higher chance of leading to states closer to 15.

Given that, I can try setting each state i to take action that increases either row or column, preferring right when possible and down otherwise.

Looking at the possible actions:

For example, in state 0 (row 0, col 0), taking action 2 would allow moving up, right, or down. But since we're already in row 0, up doesn't move, so it can go to state 1 (right) or 4 (down). So action 2 gives a chance to go right or down.

Similarly, action 3 from state 0 allows moving left, up, or right—left would loop to col 3 in row 0, which is state 3. Not helpful for getting closer to the goal, so better to choose actions that push towards higher column and row numbers.

So perhaps for each state i:

If possible, move right if not at column 3; else, move down.

But considering action possibilities:

In state 0, action 1 (right, down, left) would have a chance to go to state 1 or 4. Action 2 allows moving up (no), right, or down. So action 2 might be better as it has a higher chance of going down.

Wait, but the agent can't move up from row 0; it stays. So action 2's moves are: up (stay in state 0), right (state 1), down (state 4). Each with probability 1/3.

Similarly, action 1's moves are: right (state 1), down (state 4), left (state 3).

So from state 0, both actions 1 and 2 allow moving to states that are either towards the goal or not. But since we want to maximize progress, perhaps choosing action 2 is better because it allows a chance to go down, which might lead to more options.

But this is speculative without knowing the hole locations.

Alternatively, perhaps setting all states to always choose an action that has the highest probability of moving towards the goal.

Wait, but since each action leads to three possible moves, choosing an action that covers the most promising directions would be best.

For example:

- From state 0, choose action 1: can go right (state 1), down (state 4), or left (state 3). Maybe action 1 is better as it can go right towards higher column.
- From state 8 (row 2, col 0), choosing action 2: up (state 4), right (state 9), down (state 12). So action 2 would allow moving up or down, but since we're in row 2, moving down to row 3 (state 12) is closer to the goal.

This reasoning suggests that for each state, selecting an action that allows movement towards higher rows and columns as much as possible.

Given all this, I'll propose a new set of params where each state's action is chosen to move right or down based on their position. For instance:

- States in top-left should choose actions that can move right or down.
- Middle states should prioritize moving right when possible, else down.
- Bottom row states should stay put or try to move right if not at the end.

But since I'm supposed to output the params without any prior knowledge of holes or trajectories beyond what's given, I'll have to make a general guess. 

Looking back, one of the top-performing params had f(params) = 0.25 with a trajectory reaching state 8 and then moving towards 2, which seems counterintuitive as it goes away from the goal. So perhaps that policy isn't optimal.

Therefore, I'll propose a new set where each state directs towards the right or down in a way that progresses towards the goal.

The reasoning was to set each state's action towards moving right or down based on their position, aiming to navigate towards the goal while considering possible movements due to the slippery nature of the environment.
