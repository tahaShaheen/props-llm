You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with the highest possible reward, which should be around 1.0 if we're doing well. From what I understand, the environment is slippery, meaning each action has a 33% chance of going in three different directions. Also, there are holes that end the episode if stepped on.

Looking at the top-performing policies provided, most have an average reward around 0.15 to 0.25. That's pretty low, so I think we need to explore more rather than exploit what we've seen so far. The rewards aren't close to 1, so acting as an Explorer makes sense here.

I notice that in the top examples, some policies are moving towards the goal but not consistently avoiding holes. For example, one trajectory goes from (0,3) to (0,3) repeatedly and then falls into a hole. Another gets stuck cycling between states without making progress. So maybe we need a policy that's more cautious or takes different paths.

I should consider which actions are safest in each state. Let's map out the grid:

States 0-3: Top row
States 4-7: Second row
States 8-11: Third row
States 12-15: Bottom row

The goal is at 15, so states near it are 14 (left), 13 (up), and 15 itself. Holes aren't specified, but I'll assume some based on the trajectories. For example, state 7 might be a hole since one trajectory ends there.

For each state, I need to choose an action that maximizes the chance of reaching 15 without falling into a hole. Since the environment is slippery, actions have multiple possible outcomes, so the policy should account for those probabilities.

Let me think about key states:

- State 0 (top-left): Possible moves could be right or down. But since moving right from 0 would take us to state 1, and moving down takes us to state 4. If we choose action 0 (which allows down, left, up), but left is out of bounds, so it might stay in place. Alternatively, choosing action 3 allows right, which could be better.

Wait, no: according to the problem statement, when you take an action, you have a 33% chance of each possible direction for that action. For example, action 0 leads to down, left, up. But moving left from state 0 is impossible (as it's the top-left corner), so maybe it stays in place or wraps around? Or does it just not move? The problem statement doesn't specify, but I think it likely can't move out of bounds, so action 0 from state 0 would have two possible moves: down and up (but up is invalid, so only down). Wait no—the description says when taking an action, you pick from the three directions with equal probability. So for each action, regardless of position, you choose one of the three possible directions.

So for example, in state 0, action 0 allows moving down, left, or up. But moving left would take it to state -1, which is invalid, so perhaps it doesn't move? Or maybe it wraps around? The problem statement isn't clear on that. I'll assume that moving out of bounds doesn't change the state, meaning the agent stays put.

But for now, let's focus on choosing actions that have a higher chance of leading towards the goal while avoiding holes.

I think a good strategy is to move right and down as much as possible since those directions lead towards the bottom-right. So in states where moving right or down is an option, we should prefer those actions.

Looking at state 0 (top-left), possible actions are action 0: [down, left, up], action 1: [right, down, left], etc. To move right from state 0, the agent needs to take action 1, which has a 33% chance of moving right.

Similarly, in other states:

- State 4 (top-middle-left): Moving down would go to state 8, moving right to state 5, or left to state 3. Maybe preferring down and right is better.

But without knowing the exact hole positions, it's tricky. However, from the trajectories provided, some holes are evident. For example, in one trajectory, taking action 0 repeatedly leads to falling into a hole at state 7, so perhaps state 7 is a hole.

Assuming that, we can set policies to avoid moving towards state 7. So for states that would lead to 7 when moving right or down, we might choose different actions.

But since the exact holes are unknown, it's safer to focus on maximizing progress towards the goal while minimizing risk.

Given all this, I think a possible optimal policy is one where each state chooses an action that primarily moves towards the goal, considering the slippery nature. For example:

- In states along the top row (0-3), prefer moving right or down.
- In middle rows, move towards the right and bottom.
- Near the goal, ensure actions lead directly to it.

I'll draft a policy where each state chooses an action that has a higher probability of moving towards 15. For example:

params[0]: 1 (right)
params[1]: 1 (right)
...
But I need to check for each state what's the best action.

Alternatively, looking at the top policies provided, some have params where states near the goal are set to move right or down as much as possible. For example, in the first top policy, params[15] is 2, which might correspond to moving up or something else.

Wait, but since the environment is slippery, we can't rely on a single action to reach the goal; instead, we need to choose actions that have a path towards the goal with higher probability.

I think a possible approach is to set each state's action to prefer right and down. So for each state i:

If moving right is possible without hitting a hole, choose an action that includes right as one of its options. Similarly, if moving down leads closer to 15, choose that action.

But without knowing the holes, it's challenging. However, based on the trajectories provided, some states seem dangerous, like state 7 and perhaps others.

Given all this uncertainty, I think a reasonable next step is to propose a policy where each state tries to move right or down as much as possible, using actions that include those directions in their possibilities.

For example:

- State 0: action 1 (can move right, down, left)
- State 1: action 1 (right, down, left)
- ...
- Continue this pattern until reaching the bottom row, where moving right is towards the goal.

But I need to make sure each state's action includes directions that can lead closer to 15 without hitting holes. Since I don't have exact hole positions, I'll proceed with a general strategy.

Perhaps setting all states to action 2 or 3 might help, as those actions include right and up/down movements.

Wait, let me check the action definitions again:

- Action 0: [down, left, up]
- Action 1: [right, down, left]
- Action 2: [up, right, down]
- Action 3: [left, up, right]

So actions 1 and 2 include right, which is good for moving towards the goal. Actions 0 and 3 have less desirable directions.

Therefore, setting most states to action 1 or 2 might be beneficial.

But I need to ensure that in edge cases (like top row), we don't move out of bounds. For example, state 0 can't move left, but action 0 includes left which would keep it in place. So perhaps choosing actions that include right and down is better.

So here's a possible approach:

For each state i:
- If moving right leads towards the goal without hitting a hole, choose an action that includes right (actions 1 or 2).
- Else, choose an action that moves down (actions 0, 1, or 3).

But again, without knowing holes, it's hard. So I'll proceed with this strategy.

Let me try to create such a policy:

params[0]: 1 (right)
params[1]: 1
params[2]: 2
...
Wait, but in some states, moving right might not be safe. Alternatively, perhaps setting all states to action 3 would allow for more varied movement, increasing the chance of avoiding holes.

Alternatively, since the environment is slippery, having a mix of actions that can lead towards the goal from various directions might help.

Given the current top policies have low rewards, it's better to explore new configurations. So I'll propose a policy where each state chooses an action that is different from previous attempts, focusing on moving right and down.

After considering all this, I think setting most states to action 2 or 1 would be best, as those include right and other useful directions.

So the proposed params could be:

params[0]: 1
params[1]: 1
params[2]: 2
...
But without knowing the exact hole positions, it's a bit of a guess. However, based on the trajectories provided, I think this approach has potential.
