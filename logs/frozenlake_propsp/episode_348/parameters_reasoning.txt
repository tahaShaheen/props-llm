You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out the best policy parameters for this FrozenLake environment using a Q-learning approach with epsilon-greedy exploration. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right corner) and maximize rewards.

First, I need to understand how the policy works. Each state in the grid maps to an action based on the params array. The states are numbered from 0 to 15, where each state's value represents the corresponding action. For example, params[0] is the action for state 0, which means when the agent is at (0,0), it should take the action specified by params[0].

The policy uses an epsilon-greedy approach: with probability epsilon, it picks a random action; otherwise, it picks the best-known action. The epsilon value starts at 1 and decreases over time as exploration decreases.

I've seen different parameter sets in the examples provided. Each set gives specific values for each state's action. For instance, params[0] is 2, which means when on (0,0), take action 2. Action 2 corresponds to moving up, right, or down with equal probability. But wait, earlier I thought that when action 2 is taken, the agent moves in three directions equally.

However, looking at the examples, some states have actions like 3, which mean left, up, or down. This suggests that sometimes the best action might be a different one than the one with the highest value. That makes sense because sometimes it's better to explore other options if the current action isn't optimal.

I also notice that in some examples, certain states have action 0 (down), which means when on top row, steps down. Others have action 1 (right), meaning take right or left or down. It seems like the policy is trying to balance between taking immediate rewards and exploring other actions.

The reward structure gives a +1 for all non-absorbing states and 0 otherwise. So, it's better not to fall into any holes on the map but aim to reach state 15.

Now, considering the best known parameter set in one of the examples: params[0]:2; params[1]:3; params[2]:1; params[3]:3; etc. For each state, it seems that the optimal action varies based on the current position and the best-known value from experience.

I think the key is to explore different parameters and see which one gives the highest reward in the long run. Since some parameters yield lower rewards (like 0.25 or 0.30), I should try a wider range of epsilon values to balance exploration and exploitation properly.

Starting with an initial epsilon value, maybe around 0.1, so not too much exploration but enough for learning. As iterations increase, epsilon could gradually decrease. For instance, starting with 0.2, then reducing it over time, perhaps every 50 steps or similar.

I also need to consider whether increasing the epsilon (exploration) helps in exploring better actions when the current policy is stuck on suboptimal paths. However, if not done properly, it can lead to oscillations between good and bad actions without significant reward gain.

Considering all this, I'll propose a starting epsilon of 0.2. As the agent explores different states, I can adjust epsilon slightly each time, maybe reducing it by 0.01 every 50 iterations or something similar.
