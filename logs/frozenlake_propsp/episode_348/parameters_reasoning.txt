You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the best policy parameters for the FrozenLake environment based on the given information. The goal is to reach state 15 with a reward of +1, avoiding holes along the way.

First, looking at the recent trajectories and rewards provided, it seems that most policies aren't performing well. The highest reward so far is 0.25, which isn't close to the target of 1.0. This suggests that I'm in the exploration phase since the rewards are low.

The state transition is tricky because each action leads to three possible next states with equal probability due to the slippery nature of the environment. So, the policy needs to choose actions that maximize the chance of reaching the goal while minimizing the risk of falling into a hole.

I notice that in some top-performing policies, certain actions are repeated, like always moving right or down. Maybe I should try to guide the agent towards the goal more directly. For example, encouraging movement towards state 15 from nearby states.

Looking at the recent attempts, they often get stuck or fall into loops. To avoid this, maybe setting specific actions for each state could help. For instance, in the starting state (0), moving right might be better to head towards the goal.

I should consider which states are holes and which lead to them. From the trajectories provided, some paths end in the goal or get stuck. I need a policy that avoids these pitfalls by choosing actions that don't lead into dangerous areas.

Perhaps a greedy approach where each state's action is set to move closer to state 15 would work. For example, states in higher rows and columns should move right or down. Let me map out the best possible directions for each state.

Wait, but since the environment is slippery, moving towards the goal might not always lead directly there. Maybe a combination of actions that statistically increase the chance of reaching the goal despite the slipperiness.

I'll create a policy where each state's action is chosen to maximize the probability of eventually reaching the goal, considering the possible transitions. For example, states in the top-left should move right or down to head towards the goal.

Let me draft a tentative policy:

- For states in row 0 (states 0-3), prefer moving right.
- For states in column 3 (states 3,7,11,15), move down to reach the goal.
- Avoid actions that would lead into known holes, which might be on certain paths.

Testing this approach, I think setting each state's action to either right or down based on their position could help navigate towards the goal without falling into holes as much. Now, translating this into specific action choices for each of the 16 states.

After considering all this, I'll propose a new set of parameters that guide the agent more effectively towards the goal while avoiding potential hazards.
