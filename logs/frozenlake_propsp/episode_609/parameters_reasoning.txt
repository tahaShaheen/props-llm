You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to help find the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment using a stateless approach where each iteration provides only the reward of the previous policy without any memory.

First, understanding the environment is crucial. It's a 4x4 grid with slippery movement—each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) for a reward of +1, while avoiding holes that end the episode immediately.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 numbers, each representing the action taken from states 0 to 15. The actions are 0: down/left/up; 1: right/down/left; 2: up/right/down; and 3: left/up/right. The challenge is to set these values optimally.

Looking at the provided data, the best-performing policies have an average reward around 0.30. However, the optimal should be near 1.0, so there's room for improvement. The recent policies haven't reached this yet, indicating a need for better exploration or optimization.

Since I'm stateless and can't remember past iterations, my goal is to maximize information gain each time. If rewards are low (like below 0.3), I should explore new configurations. But if they're close to 1.0, I'd switch to optimizing the best-performing ones by tweaking them slightly.

Looking at the most recent policies, their trajectories show either loops or paths that don't reach the goal quickly, suggesting the agent is stuck or taking inefficient routes. For example, some trajectories involve repeated actions leading to no progress towards state 15.

To improve, I should consider strategies that increase the likelihood of reaching state 15 while minimizing the risk of falling into holes. This might involve setting policies that guide the agent towards the goal with higher probability paths.

I'll start by examining the current top-performing policies and see if I can adjust their parameters to move closer to the goal. For instance, in states near the goal (like 12-15), actions should be set to directly move right or down as much as possible. Also, ensuring that from each state, the chosen action has a high probability of moving towards the goal without hitting holes.

Perhaps setting certain states to always move towards the goal direction, even if it means taking a slightly longer path, could help avoid holes and reach the target more efficiently. Additionally, reviewing which states are considered "holes" would be beneficial, but since I can't do that here, I'll rely on previous trajectories to infer where dangers lie.

In conclusion, my next step is to propose a policy that directs each state towards the goal with strategic actions, considering the slippery nature and avoiding known dangerous paths as inferred from past trajectories. This should help in maximizing the reward by increasing the chance of reaching state 15 without falling into holes.
