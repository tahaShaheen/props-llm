You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the best parameters for the policy in the FrozenLake environment. The current setup is that each parameter can be 0, 1, 2, or 3, but we can't use any of the previously seen ones because the goal is to discover new paths. 

Looking at the provided examples, they all have different combinations of 0s and 1s in parameters 0 through 4. For instance, some have params[0] as 2 or 3, which suggests that higher values are explored versus others. But each example has a different combination, so it's tricky.

Since the environment is slippery, when an agent takes an action, it chooses among three directions equally. So, for each state transition, there's a 1/3 chance to go left, right, or down/up depending on the action taken.

The goal is to reach state 15 with the highest reward, which is +1. All other states give 0. However, holes in the map can cause the game to end if the agent steps onto them. To explore through these holes, the policy should aim to find unexplored paths before stepping on any holes.

The parameter array size is 16 elements, each corresponding to a state from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). Each parameter determines an action when in that state. The values are chosen from [0,1,2,3], and I need to select parameters such that the policy can navigate around the obstacles.

Looking at some examples:

- params[0] is often 2 or higher, which seems to correspond to taking a downward action more often.
- Other parameters seem varied but mostly stay in lower values.
- But since all examples are somewhat similar, it's hard to see an obvious pattern.

I think the optimal strategy would aim to explore states that have holes or lead towards them. To do this without repeating previous paths, I should increase some parameters (like 0) while decreasing others when necessary.

In the current policy, each parameter is either 1 or 2, but it's unclear if any of these are optimal. Maybe trying a combination where certain states take higher actions to explore more.

Alternatively, perhaps focusing on state transitions that have holes could help. For example, in some examples, params[0] was 3, which might be taking an action towards a hole, forcing the agent to move around it before stepping on it again.

But without knowing the specific structure of the map, I should consider general exploration strategies. A common approach is for each state to try all possible actions equally if there's uncertainty about the optimal path. But since we can't repeat previous paths, perhaps focusing on trying new states when a hole is encountered.

Given that holes are likely in certain areas (maybe the top-left and bottom-right), perhaps increasing some parameters more would help the agent find these areas first.

However, without knowing which states have holes, it's challenging. But based on the given examples, it seems that sometimes higher values like 2 or 3 are used for params[0] to encourage downward movement towards the hole. So maybe adjusting those to try even higher values when in such states might help find a better path.

In summary, I think increasing some parameters (like 0 and 1) to explore more paths could lead to a better reward. For instance, setting params[0] to 3 or 2 and others slightly adjusted for better coverage.
