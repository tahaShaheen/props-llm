You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to propose the next set of parameters for the FrozenLake environment. The goal is to help find the global optimal policy that maximizes the episodic reward, ideally reaching around 1.0.

First, let me understand the problem setup. The agent moves on a 4x4 grid with states numbered from 0 to 15. The slippery nature of the environment causes each action to result in one of three possible directions with equal probability. Holes exist that end the episode if stepped on, and the reward is +1 upon reaching state 15.

Looking at the provided data:

- The best performing params so far have an average reward of 0.45. That's significantly below the target of 1.0, which means there's room for improvement.
- The trajectories show that agents are sometimes falling into holes or not reaching the goal efficiently.

Since I'm acting as a stateless optimizer and it's iteration 1004 out of 5000, I should focus on exploring different parameter configurations to gather more information. However, since the rewards aren't close to optimal yet, I might consider slightly tweaking the best-performing params but also trying new ones.

The top params have certain actions in each state. For example, in state 0 (top-left), action 1 is chosen. Maybe trying a different action here could lead to better exploration towards the goal or avoiding holes.

I need to propose params that haven't been tried before, as per rule 1. Looking at the most recent params:

- The last few trials had varying actions in states like 0 (params[0] changing between 1 and 2). I should check if other actions in specific states could improve the path.

I'll consider changing a few key states' actions to see if that helps. For example, perhaps state 0 should move right more often or adjust other states to avoid known holes.

But wait, without knowing where the holes are exactly, it's tricky. So I need to ensure that the policy doesn't have high chances of falling into holes. Maybe adjusting certain states' actions to prioritize moves away from potential hole areas.

I'll propose a new set of params where some critical states have different actions. For instance, state 0 could try moving right (action 1) or down (action 0). I'll spread out the changes across multiple states to gather comprehensive data.

After considering all this, here's the proposed new parameter configuration.
