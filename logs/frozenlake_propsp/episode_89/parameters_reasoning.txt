You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 89 out of 5000. OUTPUT ONLY THIS SINGLE LINE:

Do NOT output anything else. No explanation, no reasoning, nothing.



LLM:
<think>
Alright, let's break down how I came up with the next set of parameters for the FrozenLake environment to optimize the policy.

First, I looked at the problem statement and understood that the goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) while avoiding holes. The environment is slippery, meaning each action has a 33% chance to go in any of three directions. The policy is defined by an array of 16 actions, one for each state.

I noticed that the previous attempts had low rewards (around 0.10), indicating that the current policies aren't performing well. Since the global optimal reward should be around 1.0, there's a lot of room for improvement. My task is to explore more by suggesting new parameter configurations that haven't been tried before and can provide more information about the environment.

Looking at the most recent parameters provided:

- The last four policies had f(params) values of 0.00, which suggests they're not effective.
- Their trajectories either loop endlessly or end up in holes quickly, indicating issues with getting stuck or not reaching the goal.

To address this, I decided to make significant changes to the policy to explore different paths. Here's what I considered:

1. **Exploration vs Exploitation**: Since the rewards are low, I'm acting as an "Explorer," so I need to try new configurations distinct from previous ones to gather more information.

2. **Avoiding Holes**: The agent must avoid falling into holes. By reviewing the trajectories, I saw that certain actions led to getting stuck or hitting holes repeatedly. So, I adjusted the policy to encourage movements towards the goal without leading the agent into dangerous areas.

3. **Path towards Goal**: To reach state 15 (bottom-right), the agent should generally move right and down. However, due to slipperiness, it's better to have a mix of actions that increase the chances of moving in the desired direction while avoiding holes.

4. **Diverse Actions**: I varied the actions across states to ensure different paths are taken, which can help identify safe routes and potentially reach the goal.

Based on this reasoning, I crafted a new set of parameters where each state has a mix of right (action 1), down (action 0), up (action 3), and left (action 2) actions. The idea is to encourage movement towards the goal while avoiding areas with holes by testing different pathways.

The final parameter configuration was chosen to ensure that from each state, there's a chance to move in directions that can lead closer to the goal without getting stuck or falling into holes as seen in previous attempts.
