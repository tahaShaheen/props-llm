You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to help find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment problem. Let me break down what's given and think through how to approach this.

First, the environment is a 4x4 grid with state numbers from 0 to 15. The goal is state 15 (bottom right), which gives +1 reward, but there are holes that end the episode if stepped on. The agent moves in four directions, but due to slipperiness, each action leads to three possible next states with equal probability.

The policy is a fixed array of 16 actions (params[0] to params[15]), each being 0-3. My job is to propose these params step by step, aiming for the highest episodic reward, ideally around 1.0.

Looking at the interaction steps, I realize that in each iteration, I propose a new set of params, and then receive feedback on their average reward over 20 episodes. The key points are:

1. **No memory**: Each proposal is independent; can't plan or remember past attempts.
2. **Maximize information gain**: Each guess should help narrow down the optimal policy.
3. **Explore vs Exploit**: If current rewards are low, explore new configurations; if close to 1.0, optimize around top performers.

From the examples provided, all top-performing params have average rewards below 0.3, which is far from the target of 1.0. This suggests that exploration is still needed. However, some trajectories show progress towards the goal but get stuck or fall into holes, indicating that certain states might be leading to dangerous paths.

For instance, in the top examples, params with higher rewards (like 0.3) have trajectories like (0,1) -> (4,2) -> (8,2), which seems to move down and then further down but doesn't reach state 15. Another trajectory goes towards state 4 and then 8 but stops there. This might mean that the policies are not effectively guiding the agent towards the goal without falling into holes.

Looking at recent params, some have reward 0.00, indicating they're either getting stuck in loops or immediately failing by stepping on a hole.

To move forward, I should consider proposing parameters that change the behavior of states near the goal and those that might lead the agent to avoid holes more effectively. Maybe adjusting actions for certain states could help the agent reach state 15 without falling into traps.

I notice that in some top params, action 2 is common. Action 2 (move up, right, down) might be a good choice because it allows for moving towards the goal while having options to avoid holes through other movements.

Another thought: Perhaps certain states near the goal are being mishandled. For example, state 15 is the goal, but if I can ensure that actions from nearby states (like 12, 13, 14) lead directly or indirectly to 15 without falling into holes, the reward would improve.

Given that, maybe I should tweak some of the top-performing params to see if small changes can push the agent closer to the goal. For example, changing an action from 3 to 2 in a critical state might redirect the agent away from a hole and towards the finish.

Alternatively, considering that all previous proposals have low rewards, maybe I should try completely different configurations for some states, especially those near holes or in paths leading towards the goal.

But since I can't remember past attempts, each proposal must be unique. So, looking at the recent params, which had a mix of 1s, 2s, and 3s, perhaps trying a configuration that emphasizes moving right (action 1) more often could help navigate towards state 15.

Wait, action 1 leads to right, down, or left with equal probability. If an agent is on the top row, taking action 1 (right) might move them right or down, which could be useful for reaching state 15.

Alternatively, perhaps action 2 and 3 are better because they include up and right/down movements, allowing more flexibility to reach the goal without falling into holes.

Another angle: The agent is likely getting stuck in cycles or hitting holes due to certain actions. Maybe I need to adjust policies so that when near a hole, the agent takes an action that avoids it by moving towards the goal instead.

I also recall that state 0 (top-left) has a high risk of falling into nearby holes if not navigated correctly. So perhaps changing params[0] from a previous value could prevent early failures.

Given all this, I think the next step is to propose a set of parameters that adjusts some actions in critical states, possibly using more right or up movements to guide towards state 15 while avoiding known hole areas.

Let me try creating a new param configuration where certain key states have their actions changed to increase the chance of moving towards the goal without falling into holes. I'll make sure this set hasn't been tried before by checking against previous examples, ensuring uniqueness.
