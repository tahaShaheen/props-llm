You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, let's try to figure out the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. So, from what I understand, it's a 4x4 grid where each state is numbered from 0 to 15. The goal is to reach state 15, which gives a reward of +1, and all other states give 0 except if you fall into a hole, which ends the episode.

The environment is slippery, meaning that when an action is taken, there's a probability of moving in one of three directions. For example, taking action 0 could lead to down, left, or up with equal chance. This makes it tricky because even if I choose a direction, the actual movement isn't guaranteed.

Looking at the problem statement, we need to find the best policy that maximizes the reward by reaching state 15 as often as possible while avoiding holes. The policy is defined by an array of 16 numbers (params[0] to params[15]), each indicating the action to take in that state.

The user has provided some previous attempts and their corresponding rewards. So far, the best reward achieved is around 0.25 over 20 episodes. The goal is to get as close to 1.0 as possible, which suggests a nearly perfect policy where the agent almost always reaches the goal without falling into holes.

From the trajectories provided, it seems that many policies are not reaching the goal or are getting stuck in loops. For example, some trajectories show repeated actions leading to no progress towards state 15. This indicates that the current policies might be choosing actions that don't efficiently navigate towards the goal or get trapped in areas with holes.

I need to think about how to design a policy that guides the agent towards state 15 while avoiding dangerous states (holes). Since the environment is slippery, each action has a probabilistic outcome. Therefore, the policy should choose actions that statistically increase the chance of moving towards the goal and decrease the chance of stepping into a hole.

First, I should identify which states are holes. The problem mentions that some states are holes but doesn't specify their exact locations. However, from the trajectories provided, I can infer which states might be dangerous. For instance, if an agent steps into a state and never returns, it's likely a hole.

Looking at the top 5 best-performing policies, they all have a reward around 0.15 to 0.25. This is much lower than the target of 1.0, indicating that the current strategies are not effective enough. So, I need to explore different policies that can navigate more effectively.

One approach is to design a policy where each state's action leads towards the goal as much as possible given the slippery nature. For example, in the top-left corner (state 0), moving right or down would make sense because those directions lead closer to state 15. However, due to the slipperiness, I need to choose actions that statistically have a higher chance of moving towards the goal.

Another consideration is avoiding states that are holes. If certain states are known to be holes, the policy should avoid them by not choosing actions that lead there. But since we don't know which states are holes, we can only infer based on past trajectories where agents fell into them.

Looking at the recent policies and their trajectories, some seem to get stuck or loop around without reaching the goal. So, perhaps adjusting certain state's actions could help break these loops and push the agent towards the goal.

I should also consider that each action has a 1/3 chance of moving in different directions. Therefore, for each state, I need to choose an action that maximizes the probability of moving closer to the goal while minimizing the risk of entering a hole.

Maybe trying out a greedy approach where each action is chosen based on the direction that statistically brings the agent closer to state 15, considering the probabilities due to slipperiness. For example, in state 0 (top-left corner), choosing an action that has the highest probability of moving right or down would be beneficial.

Alternatively, perhaps using a value iteration approach where each state's optimal action is determined based on expected rewards, but given the stochastic nature and unknown hole positions, this might be challenging without more information.

Given that in the recent policies, some have params[0] set to 2 (action up), which from state 0 would lead to either move down, left, or up. Moving up from state 0 is impossible since it's already at the top, so perhaps action 2 isn't the best choice there. Maybe choosing action 1 for state 0, which could lead to right, down, or left.

Wait, no. The description says that each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability. For example, action 0 from any state can lead to down, left, up, etc., depending on the state's position. So, I need to think about what each action does in terms of movement probabilities for each state.

Perhaps it's better to look at each state and decide which action gives the highest chance of moving towards the goal while avoiding holes. For example:

- State 0 (top-left corner): Possible actions could be right or down to move towards the goal.
- State 15: This is the goal, so no action needed once reached.

But since the environment is slippery, even if I choose an action that should move in a certain direction, there's a chance it might take another path. So, the policy needs to be robust enough to account for these probabilities.

Another thought: Maybe using a policy where each state's action is chosen such that on average, over many attempts, the agent progresses towards the goal. For example, from state 0, choosing an action that tends to move right or down more often would help.

Looking back at the previous policies, I notice that some have params[0] set to 2 or 1, which might correspond to actions that don't effectively move towards the goal. So, perhaps adjusting these initial states' actions could lead to better progress.

Also, considering the recent attempts where the reward is as low as 0.05, it's clear that many policies aren't effective. Therefore, I should propose a policy that significantly changes some of the action choices, especially in key states like state 0 and those near the goal.

In conclusion, to maximize the reward, I need to design a policy where each state's action is chosen to statistically move towards the goal while avoiding holes as much as possible. This might involve selecting actions that have a higher probability of moving right or down from the top-left corner and similar strategic moves in other states.
