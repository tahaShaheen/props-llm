You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out the best policy parameters for this FrozenLake environment with the slippery action rules given. The goal is to reach state 15 (the right-bottom grid) while avoiding the holes. Each hole will cause the game to end, and we need to explore through trajectories to overcome them.

First, I know that the agent starts at state 0, which is the top-left corner. With the slippery policy parameters provided in the examples, some of them are set higher (like 2) while others are lower (like 1 or 3). The goal is to find a combination where the agent can navigate the grid safely without getting stuck or falling into the holes.

Looking at one example where params[0] is 2 and params[7] is also 3, it's clear that action 2 is chosen for top-left, which could be moving up. But if the top row has a hole (state 6 in this case), then the agent might get stuck there. However, other actions are still possible, so maybe it can find an alternative path.

Another example sets params[0] to 1 and action 3 for states where the bottom-right is a hole. This suggests that avoiding holes by choosing safe actions based on their positions could be effective. For instance, when in certain areas with holes, using action 3 (which picks directions left, up, or right) might help.

I also notice that some parameters are set to 0, which means the agent can choose any action from the available ones. But sometimes, choosing a specific action like moving down or right is necessary to progress without getting trapped by holes.

Considering all this, I think setting params[0] and params[2] to 2 (move up) might help avoid holes in the top row, while params[7] being 3 (left, up, right) could allow the agent to handle areas where movement is restricted. For other states, using action 1 (right, down, left) ensures a broad exploration without getting stuck.

But I'm not entirely sure about all the parameters, so maybe I should simulate each possible combination of params and see which one yields the highest reward. However, given that it's a simulation, I'll have to rely on the examples provided and logical reasoning instead.
