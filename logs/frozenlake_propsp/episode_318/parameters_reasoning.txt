You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right) with a reward of +1, and avoid holes which end the episode. Since the environment is slippery, each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability. 

From the problem description, I know that the agent's policy is determined by an array of 16 actions, each corresponding to states 0 through 15. The challenge is to find the optimal set of actions that maximizes the average reward over episodes.

Looking at the provided data, the top-performing policies are yielding rewards around 0.25, which is significantly below the target of 1.0. This suggests that there's room for improvement. The recent policies tried have mostly resulted in very low or zero rewards, indicating that they might not be effective in reaching the goal.

I need to consider the structure of the environment. The grid has holes, and the agent needs to avoid them while navigating towards state 15. Since the environment is slippery, deterministic paths aren't possible; the policy must account for probabilistic movement.

Given that all recent policies have low rewards, I should switch strategies from exploitation to exploration. My goal now is to propose a new set of parameters that haven't been tried before and could potentially explore more effectively towards state 15.

I'll start by analyzing the grid layout. The starting positions are states 0 (top-left) and other initial states. From each state, depending on the action chosen, the agent has a 33% chance to move in one of three directions. To maximize the chance of reaching state 15, I should design a policy that generally moves the agent downward or rightward, but considering the possible slips.

For example:
- In state 0 (top-left), choosing action 2 (which allows moving up, right, or down) might help move towards the goal.
- Similarly, in other states along the top row, actions should encourage movement downwards to progress towards the bottom-right corner.

I'll also need to ensure that certain high-risk states with holes have policies that avoid them. If a state is known to be a hole (e.g., state 14), the policy should take an action that doesn't lead directly into it but instead moves towards safe areas.

Based on this reasoning, I'll construct a new params array where each state's action is chosen to either move towards the goal or avoid holes. This will involve selecting actions that have a higher probability of leading the agent closer to state 15 while minimizing the chance of falling into traps.
