You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment using the given setup. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) and avoid holes. Each action taken has a 33% chance of going in one of three directions due to the slippery nature.

First, I need to understand the environment better. It's a 4x4 grid with states numbered from 0 to 15. The agent starts at state 0 (top-left) and needs to get to state 15. There are holes which cause the episode to end immediately upon stepping on them.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 elements, each corresponding to a state and indicating which action to take when in that state. The actions are 0,1,2,3, each with their own set of possible moves. For example, action 0 can lead to down, left, or up.

Looking at the top-performing policies provided, I see that some have higher rewards around 0.3, which is better than others but still far from the optimal 1.0. The trajectories show that many policies are getting stuck in loops or falling into holes before reaching the goal.

Since my role is to suggest the next set of parameters, I should consider what changes can maximize information gain without repeating previous configurations. Since the rewards aren't close to 1.0, I'm in "Explorer" mode and need to try new configurations distinct from past ones.

I notice that some policies tend to oscillate between states or move towards walls where holes are present. To avoid this, maybe adjusting certain states' actions to prioritize safer moves could help. For example, near the edges, taking actions that minimize falling into holes might be better.

Looking at the last 5 parameters suggested, they all seem to have issues with either getting stuck in loops or not moving towards the goal effectively. I need a configuration where from each state, there's a higher chance of progressing towards the goal without stepping on holes.

One approach is to set policies that encourage movement towards the right and down, as those directions are more likely to lead towards the goal. However, since actions are slippery, the actual direction taken can vary. So maybe choosing actions in each state that have a high probability of moving closer to 15, considering all possible outcomes.

For instance, from state 0 (top-left), if I choose action 3, which allows moving right, up, or left. Moving right would take it towards the goal, so perhaps setting params[0] = 3 could be beneficial. Similarly, for other states near the edges, selecting actions that push towards the goal.

I should also consider states near holes and ensure that their policies don't lead the agent into those. For example, if state 1 is adjacent to a hole (if any), choosing an action that moves away from it would be safer.

Given all this, I'll create a new params array where each state's action is chosen to either move towards the goal or avoid holes. This should maximize the chances of reaching the goal while minimizing risks.
