You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with the highest possible reward, and the agent can move in four directions but has a slippery effect where each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability. There are also holes that end the episode if stepped on.

First, I need to understand the structure of the environment. It's a 4x4 grid, so states go from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). The agent starts at state 0, and the goal is state 15. Each state has certain actions that can be taken, but due to the slippery nature, each action doesn't always lead directly to the intended next state.

Looking at the problem statement, I see that the policy is an array of 16 numbers, each corresponding to a state, and each value (0-3) represents the action to take. The challenge is to find the optimal set of actions across all states such that the agent maximizes its reward by reaching state 15 without falling into any holes.

From the provided examples, it seems like the best-performing policies are yielding around 0.45 average reward over 20 episodes. The top policies have some specific patterns in their params. For instance, many of them set certain states to action 3 or 1, which might indicate strategies that encourage moving towards the goal while avoiding holes.

Given that I'm at iteration 1137 out of 5000, and based on the feedback from previous iterations (rewards around 0.45), it seems like we're in an exploration phase but not yet exploiting near-optimal policies. The top-performing params suggest a mix of actions, especially towards the goal states.

I should consider what the optimal policy might look like. Ideally, the agent would take actions that maximize its chance to reach state 15 while avoiding holes. However, due to the slippery nature, each action has only a 1/3 chance to lead in any direction. So, the policy needs to choose actions that statistically increase the likelihood of moving towards the goal.

Looking at the grid, states close to the bottom-right (like 14 and 15) should have actions that push towards 15. Similarly, other states should have actions that guide the agent towards these goal areas while avoiding known holes.

From the trajectories provided, some policies get stuck in loops or end up in holes because their action choices don't account for the slippery nature properly. For example, a policy that always chooses to move right (action 1) might end up taking other directions due to the slipperiness, leading to potential falls into holes.

I think I should propose a new set of params that deviates from previous ones but still adheres to strategies that push towards the goal. Maybe adjusting certain states' actions to encourage more direct paths while avoiding areas with high fall probabilities.

Looking at the top 5 best params, they have a mix of actions in different states. For example, state 0 (top-left) is set to action 1 or 2, which might mean trying to move down-right. Similarly, other states have a combination of actions that could be balancing between moving towards the goal and avoiding holes.

Since the current rewards are below the optimal 1.0, I should focus on exploring more configurations rather than optimizing existing ones. However, I need to make sure each new param is unique from previous attempts to gather as much information as possible.

Considering all this, I'll propose a new set of params where certain states have different actions compared to the top performers. For example, in state 0, choosing action 3 instead of 1 or 2 might lead the agent to try moving right more often, increasing chances to reach the goal. Similarly, other states could be adjusted to nudge towards the center or bottom-right.

After analyzing, I'll construct a new params array where each state is assigned an action that statistically increases the chance to move towards the goal while avoiding potential holes.
