You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to optimize the policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get the highest possible reward, which should be around 1.0 if we're doing everything right. Let's break down what I know.

First, the environment is a 4x4 grid where the agent can move in four directions—up, down, left, right. But because it's slippery, each action actually results in moving in one of three possible directions with equal probability. That adds some uncertainty to the movement.

The reward is +1 if the agent reaches state 15 (the bottom-right corner), and 0 otherwise. There are also holes that can end the episode immediately if stepped on. The policy is a function that maps each state (from 0 to 15) to an action, and we need to find the optimal set of actions.

Looking at the previous interactions, I see that most policies have been yielding very low rewards, around 0.00 or 0.05 over 20 episodes. That suggests that either the agent isn't reaching the goal often, or it's falling into holes frequently. My job is to propose a new set of parameters (params) that might improve this.

Since the global optimal reward should be around 1.0, I'm assuming that with perfect play, the agent would reach state 15 every time. So, our current policies aren't anywhere near optimal yet.

The user mentioned that I need to explore and exploit based on the rewards. Since the rewards are still low, I'm in the explorer phase, so I should propose a new set of parameters that are distinct from previous ones to gather more information about which actions lead to success or failure.

Looking at the trajectories provided earlier, some agents get stuck in loops or fall into holes quickly. For example, one trajectory was (0,1) leading to state 4 and then 8, but I'm not sure how that ended up with a reward of 0.05. Another trajectory had the agent moving from state 0 to state 1, which might be a better path.

I think a key strategy is to have policies that guide the agent towards the goal while avoiding holes as much as possible. Maybe setting actions that generally move towards the right and down would help, given the grid structure. But because of the slippery nature, each action has a 33% chance of going in any direction.

So, for states closer to the goal (like state 15), we want to maximize the chance of moving towards it. For example, if an agent is at state 12 (which is one step up from the bottom row), moving down would take them to state 13 or 14, which are in the same column but different rows.

But wait, I need to consider that some states might have holes. Since we don't know exactly where the holes are, the policy needs to be robust enough to avoid them statistically. Maybe encouraging movements towards the goal while diversifying actions could help reduce the risk of falling into a hole.

Another thought is that maybe certain actions from specific states have higher probabilities of leading to the goal or avoiding holes. For example, if an agent is at state 14 (third row, last column), moving right would take them to state 15 with some probability, which is good. But since movement is slippery, perhaps choosing multiple possible directions could help.

I also noticed that in previous attempts, the trajectories often get stuck or loop around without reaching the goal. So maybe adjusting the policy to encourage more varied movements or prioritizing certain directions based on proximity to the goal would be beneficial.

Given all this, I think a good starting point is to set each state's action to one that generally moves towards the right or down, as those are the directions leading towards the goal (state 15). For example:

- From state 0 (top-left), moving right might lead to state 1, which could be safer.
- From state 3 (top-right), moving down is necessary to get closer to the goal.

But I need to ensure that each action in params is from [0,1,2,3]. So, for each state, I should assign an action that maximizes the chance of moving towards the goal while considering the possible movement outcomes due to slipperiness.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look at how each action affects the next states. For example:

- Action 0: moves down, left, or up with equal probability.
- Action 1: moves right, down, or left with equal probability.
- Action 2: moves up, right, or down with equal probability.
- Action 3: moves left, up, or right with equal probability.

So, for each state, I need to choose an action that gives the highest chance of moving towards the goal while avoiding holes. Since we don't know where the holes are, it's a balance between exploration and exploitation.

Considering all this, maybe setting all states to take action 2 (which allows movement up, right, or down) could provide more flexibility in navigating towards the goal. Alternatively, mixing actions might be better because each action has different possible outcomes that can lead towards the goal from various positions.

But without knowing the exact locations of the holes, it's tricky. However, since we're supposed to find a policy that works despite the holes, perhaps making sure that from any state, there's a path that leads to the goal without stepping on a hole is key.

Given that in previous attempts, agents often ended up stuck or falling into loops, I should propose a new set of parameters where each state has an action that generally pushes towards the right and down directions. Let me assign actions accordingly:

- States 0-3 (top row): prefer moving down to get closer to the goal.
- States in columns 2 and 3: maybe move right or down depending on position.

But since I need to assign each state an action, perhaps a more systematic approach is needed. For example:

- For states that are in the top two rows (0-7), prefer moving down towards the bottom rows.
- For states in the last two columns (12-15), prefer moving right if possible.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to set each state to take action 3, which allows movement left, up, or right. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach is to have a greedy policy that always tries to move towards the goal as much as possible. For example:

- From state i, choose an action that has the highest probability of moving closer to state 15.

But given the slippery nature, each action can lead in three directions, so it's not straightforward.

Perhaps another way is to look at the previous policies and see if there's a pattern or a set of actions that hasn't been tried yet. Since all previous policies have low rewards, maybe a completely different approach is needed.

Wait, looking back at the top 4 best-performing params, they all had f(params) around 0.05. That suggests that none are particularly good yet. So I need to think of a policy that could potentially reach state 15 more often.

Maybe setting all states to take action 2 (up, right, down). Let's see:

Action 2: up, right, or down with equal probability.

So for each state i, set params[i] = 2.

But I'm not sure if that's the best. Alternatively, mixing actions might help.

Alternatively, perhaps setting the policy to alternate between moving right and down based on the state's position.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to have states in even columns move right and odd columns move down or something like that. But without knowing the exact positions of the holes, it's hard to make precise decisions.

Given all this uncertainty, perhaps the best strategy is to propose a new set of parameters where each state chooses an action that gives a good balance between moving towards the goal and exploring different paths to avoid holes.

After considering these factors, I'll propose setting each state's action as follows:

- For states in rows 0 and 1 (top two rows), choose actions that move down.
- For states in columns 2 and 3 (rightmost columns), choose actions that move right or down.
- Avoid actions that could lead into the top-right corner if it's a hole.

But without knowing the holes' locations, this is speculative. So perhaps a safer approach is to assign each state an action that has a high chance of moving towards the goal. Let me consider:

For each state i:

If in the top row (0-3), choose action 1 or 0 to move down or right.

Wait, maybe assigning all states to take action 1 could be better because it allows movement right, which is towards the goal.

Alternatively, perhaps a combination of actions that encourage movement towards the goal while providing some variance.

After thinking through, I'll propose setting params[i] as follows:

- For states in even-numbered rows (0,2), choose action 1 to move right or down.
- For states in odd-numbered rows (1,3), choose action 0 to move down.

But this is a rough idea. Alternatively, perhaps each state should have an action that points towards the direction of the goal as much as possible.

Alternatively, maybe setting all states to take action 2 could be beneficial because it allows moving up, right, or down. This way, from any position, the agent has multiple options to move towards the goal without being stuck in a particular direction.

Wait, but I think that might not be optimal. Let me instead consider:

- For each state, choose an action that increases the row number (downwards) or column number (rightwards) as much as possible given the action's possible outcomes.

Looking at the actions:

Action 0: down, left, up
Action 1: right, down, left
Action 2: up, right, down
Action 3: left, up, right

So, for states in row < 3 (since state 15 is row 3), we want to move down if possible. For columns < 3, we want to move right.

But since each action can lead to multiple directions, perhaps choosing actions that have a higher probability of moving towards the goal.

For example:

- If in the top row (state 0-3), choose action 1 to increase column (right) or down.
- If in other rows, choose action 2 to move right or down.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps setting each state's action based on their position relative to the goal:

For states where moving right is possible without falling into a hole, set action 1; else, set action 0.

But again, without knowing the holes, it's challenging.

Given that I need to propose a new params array, and considering that previous attempts have low rewards, perhaps trying a policy where each state takes action 2 (up, right, down) could allow more flexibility in reaching the goal while avoiding some holes.

So, tentatively, I'll set all params[i] = 2 for i from 0 to 15. This way, each state has an equal chance of moving up, right, or down, which might help navigate towards the goal without getting stuck in loops.
