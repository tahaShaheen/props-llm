You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I need to help find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let's see what I have here.

First, understanding the environment: It's a 4x4 grid with states from 0 to 15. The goal is state 15, which gives +1 reward. Other states give 0. There are holes that end the episode if stepped on. The slippery nature means each action has three possible outcomes with equal probability.

The policy is an array of 16 numbers (params[0] to params[15]), each representing the action taken in that state. Actions can be 0,1,2,3. The goal is to maximize the reward, ideally reaching around 1.0 per episode.

Looking at the provided data:

- There are top 3 best performing params with rewards 0.30, 0.25, and 0.20. Their trajectories show they sometimes reach closer to the goal but still not enough.
- The most recent four policies have lower rewards: 0.05, 0.00, 0.00, and 0.05. Their trajectories either loop or end up in holes.

Since we're at iteration 635 out of 5000, it's early enough to still explore but perhaps starting to optimize if possible.

The user mentioned that the global optimal reward should be around 1.0. So far, none of the policies have achieved this, so we need to find a better one.

I should propose a new set of params that haven't been tried before and could potentially reach state 15 with high probability without falling into holes.

Looking at the previous top params, they might be too cautious or not taking the right path. Maybe adjusting some actions in key states can help.

For example, state 0 is (0,0). If it's set to action 2 (up), but since it's already on row 0, up would cause a move to either left, down, or up—though up might be invalid and probably leads to another direction. Maybe setting it to action 1 (right) could help move towards state 3.

Similarly, for other states along the path to 15, ensuring that actions guide towards the goal while avoiding holes.

I need to create a policy where each state has an action that increases the chances of moving closer to 15 without stepping into holes. Since it's slippery, the policy must account for all possible outcomes.

Let me try creating a new params array:

- For states near the goal (like 12, 13, 14), set actions that would likely move right or down towards 15.
- Avoid actions that could lead to holes in known problematic areas.

Perhaps using a combination of actions that prioritize moving right and down but also have some exploration built in due to the slippery nature.

I'll construct the params array step by step, ensuring each state's action is optimal. Let me think about key states:

State 0 (top-left corner): Maybe move right or down.
States along the top row: Moving towards right or down.
Middle rows: Actions that guide towards the bottom-right.
Avoiding actions that could lead to holes in known positions.

After considering, here's a possible new params configuration that hasn't been tried yet and might lead closer to the goal:

params[0]: 1, params[1]: 2, params[2]: 3, params[3]: 3, params[4]: 3, params[5]: 2, params[6]: 1, params[7]: 3, params[8]: 2, params[9]: 1, params[10]: 3, params[11]: 2, params[12]: 1, params[13]: 3, params[14]: 2, params[15]: 3
