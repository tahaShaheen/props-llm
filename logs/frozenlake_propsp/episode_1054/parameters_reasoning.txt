You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get the highest possible reward, which should be around 1.0 if we're doing everything right. Let's see what information I have.

First, the environment is a 4x4 grid with states numbered from 0 to 15. The slippery nature of the environment means that when you take an action, there's a 33% chance of moving in one of three directions. So, if I choose an action for a state, the actual movement isn't guaranteed—it could go in any of three possible ways.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 numbers, each corresponding to an action (0-3) for each state. The challenge here is to find the optimal set of actions that maximizes the average reward over 20 episodes.

Looking at the history provided, I see some top-performing params and their trajectories. For example, in one case, the policy with certain params resulted in a trajectory that reached state 15 (the goal) but only achieved an average reward of 0.45. That's not too bad, but we're aiming for around 1.0.

The recent iterations show some lower rewards, like 0.00 and 0.10, which might indicate that the policies are either getting stuck in loops or falling into holes frequently. So, I need to think about how to adjust the policy to avoid those pitfalls.

Since the environment is slippery, the agent has a tendency to move in multiple directions when taking an action. Therefore, choosing actions that have a higher probability of moving towards the goal or away from the holes is crucial.

Looking at the recent params, some states are choosing actions that lead them into holes. For example, if state 0 (top-left) chooses action 1, it might move right, down, or left with equal chance. If moving down leads to a hole, then this could be problematic. So, I need to ensure that for each state, the chosen action has at least one safe direction towards the goal.

Let me consider what actions lead closer to the goal (state 15). The goal is in the bottom-right corner, so moving right or down should generally help. However, due to the slippery nature, these movements might not always go as planned. So, perhaps choosing actions that have a higher chance of eventually reaching the goal without hitting any holes.

I also notice that some policies are getting stuck in loops, like going back and forth between states without making progress. That's probably because the policy isn't encouraging movement towards the goal when possible.

So, I think the key is to set each state's action such that it has a high probability of moving towards the goal or avoiding dangerous areas. Let me map out for each state what actions would be most beneficial.

For example:
- State 0 (top-left): Possible actions could be down (towards state 4) or right (towards state 1). So, choosing action 1 might have a higher chance of moving right or down.
- State 1: Similarly, moving down to state 5 or right to state 2. Action 3 might give a mix of up, left, and right, which could be risky if left leads to a hole.

Wait, I need to remember where the holes are. The user didn't specify them initially, but from the trajectories, I can infer that certain states are holes because stepping on them ends the episode with 0 reward.

Looking at the recent trajectory: (0,1) (4,1) (8,1). This suggests that state 4 is being moved into without hitting a hole. But another trajectory was (0,2) (4,3), which might mean state 4's action leads to a problem.

Wait, actually, the trajectories show where the agent goes when following the policy. So if in a certain state, the action chosen leads to a sequence that ends at the goal or a hole, we can infer whether that path is safe.

But without knowing exactly which states are holes, it's tricky. However, based on the provided top-performing policies and their trajectories, I can see which actions lead towards success or failure.

For instance, one policy got to state 15 in three steps: (0,1) (4,1) (8,1). That suggests that moving down from state 0 (action 1), then again down from state 4 (action 1), and so on leads towards the goal. But this only gave a reward of 0.45, which is lower than desired.

Another trajectory reached the goal but with more steps: (0,1) (1,3) ... (9,2) (14,3). That's a longer path but still ends at the goal. However, it might have had some backtracking or loops that reduced the reward.

Given that we're in iteration 1054, and the rewards are around 0.45 on average, I think we need to explore more policies that can reliably reach the goal without getting stuck or falling into holes.

Perhaps a good approach is to set each state's action to one that has a high probability of moving towards the goal. For example, in the top-left (state 0), choosing an action that primarily moves down or right. Similarly, for other states near the edges, choose actions that move towards the bottom-right direction.

But considering the slippery nature, we can't rely on a single action to get us there; instead, we need a policy that navigates in the general direction of the goal while avoiding known dangerous areas.

Given that the most recent policies are giving low rewards, I should try changing some actions in critical states. For example, if certain states are leading into holes when choosing specific actions, I can switch to an action that avoids those paths.

Looking at the params from the top-performing policies, they have a mix of actions 1 and 3 for state 0. Maybe trying action 2 or another action in some states could lead to better outcomes.

Wait, but without knowing which states are holes, it's challenging. However, from the trajectories provided, I can see that certain transitions are leading to termination (either goal or hole). For example, a trajectory that ends quickly might indicate hitting a hole.

In one case, the trajectory was (0,1) (4,1) (8,1), which suggests that state 8 leads to the goal. So perhaps state 8's action is set to move down again. But if moving down from state 8 leads to a hole, then we need to adjust.

Alternatively, maybe I should focus on setting up actions for each state that have at least one safe direction towards the goal and minimize chances of hitting holes.

Given all this, perhaps the optimal policy would be to set most states to action 2 or 3, which tend to include right and up/down movements. Or maybe a combination that encourages movement towards the bottom-right while avoiding left moves that could lead into holes.

But since I'm constrained by the format of outputting only the params line, I'll need to make an educated guess based on previous successful policies but tweak some actions to avoid loops or dangerous paths.

Looking at one of the top policies:

params[0]: 1; ... which led to a trajectory that reached state 15. So perhaps keeping action 1 for state 0 is good, as it allows movement down, left, or right with equal chance, increasing the probability of moving towards the goal.

But in some recent policies, changing certain states' actions to different values didn't help, leading to lower rewards. Maybe I should try a similar approach but adjust specific states where the current policy isn't performing well.

Given that, perhaps for state 4 (which is the second cell in the top row), setting it to action 0 might help move down more directly towards the goal. Alternatively, keeping action 1 could also work if it's part of a successful trajectory.

Wait, but without knowing where the holes are exactly, I have to make educated guesses based on the trajectories provided.

In one recent attempt, params[4] was set to 0 (action 0), which might move down. If that leads to state 8, which is closer to the goal, that could be beneficial.

Another point: The highest reward achieved so far is around 0.45, which is significantly below the target of 1.0. So perhaps we need a policy that can reliably reach the goal in all episodes or at least consistently get close to it without falling into holes.

This might require setting up a policy where each state's action has a high probability of moving towards the goal and low probability of moving towards a hole or getting stuck.

Given that, I think setting most states to action 2 or 3 could be beneficial because these actions include right and down movements, which are generally towards the goal. However, since the environment is slippery, it's possible that even choosing these actions might sometimes lead left or up, but perhaps in a way that still progresses towards the goal over time.

Alternatively, maybe using action 1 for some states could help as well, depending on their position relative to the goal.

Considering all this, I think I'll propose a policy where most states are set to action 2 or 3, ensuring movement towards the right and down directions. But I'll make sure that certain edge cases, like being near the edges of the grid, have appropriate actions to avoid moving out of bounds or into holes.

I need to ensure that each state's action is unique from previous policies to maximize information gain, as per the strategy. So if previous top policies had similar structures, I should vary at least some parameters.

But given the format constraint, I'll propose a new set of params where most states are 2 or 3, but with some variation in critical states like state 0 and others.

So here's my proposed params:

params[0]:1 (state 0 takes action 1 to move down, right, or left)
params[1]:3
params[2]:1
...
But wait, I need to map out all 16 states. Let me think for each state what would be the best action.

Alternatively, perhaps using a simple policy like always moving right or down when possible.

Wait, but since it's slippery, we can't rely on that. So maybe setting actions in such a way that even if there are multiple directions, at least one leads towards the goal.

Another approach is to have states near the top and left choose actions that encourage moving right or down, while states near the bottom-right have actions that stay put or move towards the goal.

But without knowing hole positions, it's challenging. So perhaps I can look for a policy that has as many right and down moves as possible in their action sets.

Wait, looking back at the top-performing policies, some had state 0 with action 1 (which includes moving down, left, or right). That seems useful because from state 0, moving right takes you to state 1, which is still on the top row but not towards the goal. Moving down takes you to state 4, which is closer.

So maybe keeping state 0's action as 1 is good. Similarly, for other states, setting actions that have a higher chance of moving down or right.

Given all this, I think I'll propose a policy where most states are set to action 2 or 3, with some variation in others. For example:

params[0]:1 (action 1)
params[1]:3
params[2]:1
...
But without knowing the exact hole positions, it's hard to be precise.

Alternatively, perhaps I should mirror a successful policy but change one or two parameters to see if that improves performance. Since in previous top policies, state 0 was set to action 1, maybe keeping that and tweaking others could help.

So, my proposed params would be similar to the top-performing ones but with some changes to avoid loops or improve goal-reaching chances.
