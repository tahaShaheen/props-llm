You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to help the agent find the optimal policy in the FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with a reward of +1, and all other states give a reward of 0. However, there are some holes that end the game if stepped on. So, the agent needs to explore through these holes by reading history trajectories.

The policy is a function mapped from states (0-15) to actions (0-3). The current value parameters, params[0] to params[15], determine which action is chosen for each state. Each param can be 0, 1, 2, or 3, each corresponding to a specific direction.

The agent's policy needs to avoid falling into the holes and exploit the best possible paths when on wholes. But since some states are holes, the policy must be adaptive, exploring trajectories as needed without revisiting familiar states.

First, I need to understand that the optimal reward f(params) should aim for at least 1.0. The current examples show various param values with varying rewards. To find the best params, I'll have to explore different combinations and observe the resulting rewards.

I know that action selection is deterministic: from each state, certain actions are chosen based on the current policy parameters. The agent's exploration should focus on states that might lead into holes or are in danger of falling in.

Given that all hole states (where reward is 0 except state 15) are unknown to the agent initially, the agent must explore these areas. However, once it steps on a hole, any further action is unsuccessful and will lead to failure with reward 0.

The goal is to maximize f(params), which tracks the total reward from the starting state (state 0). The best path from state 0 to state 15 avoids all holes except possibly ones that are known after exploration.

To find the optimal params, I need to test different combinations of action choices in each state. Starting with parameters as high as possible for states near the goal might be good because stepping on those could give immediate rewards.

For example, when on state 0, choosing action 3 (left) allows it to move right, which is more likely to proceed towards the goal. This way, the agent can explore different paths without being trapped by holes.

As exploration progresses, I should focus on states that are known to have holes or are critical for avoiding them. Using parameters like params[0]=1, params[2]=3, and params[4]=0 might be effective if state 0 is dangerous but offers immediate rewards when stepped on.

I need to ensure the agent always explores areas with unknown holes by varying action choices based on current policy. This will allow it to find safe paths through the environment without getting stuck.

After several iterations, the agent should discover a policy that maximizes the reward across all possible states, particularly focusing on transitions leading to state 15 without stepping into holes.
