You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help optimize the policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with as high a reward as possible, avoiding the holes. Let's see what information I have so far.

First, the environment is a 4x4 grid where each cell can be represented by a number from 0 to 15. Moving in any direction has a 33% chance of going in one of three directions due to slipperiness. The policy is an array of 16 elements, each indicating the action (0-3) for that state.

Looking at the top performing params provided earlier, most have an average reward around 0.45. That's significantly below the target of 1.0, so I'm in "Explorer" mode. My task is to propose a new set of params that's different from previous ones to gather more information.

In the recent attempts, there were some policies with lower rewards like 0.20 and even 0.00. This suggests that those configurations might be leading into holes or not reaching the goal efficiently.

I need to find a policy that either leads directly towards the goal or avoids known holes effectively. Since slipperiness can cause unintended movements, each state's action should consider possible transitions that avoid dangerous states.

Looking at the initial trajectories, some params keep looping without progress, which isn't helpful. So, I should design actions that encourage movement towards the goal (state 15) even with the possibility of slipping.

For example, in state 0 (top-left), choosing action 3 (which can move right, down, or up) might be good because moving right could lead to a better position, and slipping down would take it closer to the center. Similarly, for other states, choosing actions that maximize the chance of progressing towards the goal while avoiding known holes.

I should also ensure that each state's action doesn't have a high probability of leading into a hole. For instance, states near the edges might need cautious actions to prevent falling into the water.

Given that previous attempts didn't reach 1.0, I'll propose a new set where certain key states take specific actions to push towards the goal more aggressively, considering their slip probabilities.

After analyzing, here's a proposed params array:
params[0]: 3; because moving right or down could help.
params[1]: 2; action that can move up, right, down. Maybe helps in avoiding holes.
... and so on for each state, ensuring each choice is strategic to reach the goal.

I'll make sure this set hasn't been tried before by comparing with previous top params listed. Since the rewards are still low, exploring new configurations is crucial.
