You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment that's been set up as an slippery grid. The goal is to get from one corner of the grid to the bottom-right corner (state 15) and maximize the reward. Each state gives a reward of +1 if it's not the hole, which I assume is on some squares in the middle, but the problem says that instead of being able to step onto them, we have to explore through trajectories by reading history.

The policy function takes an array of 16 values (params[0] to params[15]) where each value represents the action to take from a state. The actions are 0-3 corresponding to left, down, right, and up directions respectively. However, in this problem, since the grid is slippery, when an action is taken, it has equal probability among three possible directions instead of one.

The challenge here is that each action chosen randomly might not explore the entire state space effectively, especially around the holes which could trap the agent. The current policy uses default values of [0, 1, 2, 3], which means actions are taken in a fixed order. But this may lead to getting stuck or taking suboptimal paths.

The user wants me to propose optimal params by trying different values from [0,1,2,3] for each state. Since it's a 4x4 grid, there are 16 states (states 0-15), so the policy parameters array has 16 elements. Each element represents an action taken when in that state.

I remember from the example provided that some policies had varying actions based on their position. For instance, params[0] being 2 means when in state 0, take up direction. The other states follow similar patterns.

Looking at the top performing parameters, like params[0]:2, params[1]:3, etc., seem to use different strategies for certain rows or columns. It's likely that these policies exploit specific areas of the grid by choosing different actions when in different positions.

Since the user is asking me to find a global optimal policy, I should consider trying various combinations and see which one performs best. But manually testing all 4^16 possibilities isn't feasible. Instead, I can look for patterns or symmetries that might lead to better exploration and reward collection.

One strategy could be to assign higher action numbers (like 3) when in certain states where they are more likely to avoid the hole. For example, focusing on up-right actions (actions 2 and 3) when near the top-left corner or bottom-right corner might help explore both ends effectively.

Alternatively, balancing exploration between different regions could be beneficial. Maybe sometimes taking a random action helps discover new paths while other times following the current policy leads to better immediate rewards.

I should also consider that in slippery grids, even a small change can lead to significant movement. Therefore, consistently choosing the same action might not be optimal if it's leading towards the hole or getting stuck.

Given all this, I'll try assigning higher values (like 2 and 3) more often when being near certain states that are either on the edge or around the hole. For instance, maybe in state 0-2 and other positions where going up is safer than going right, assign action 2, and when down is better, assign action 3.

Wait, but looking at some example parameters, sometimes they take action 1 (right) or 2 (up). Maybe a mixed approach would work: mix taking action 1 with others to explore different directions. For instance, have a decent number of actions in {0, 2} for certain states and more varied others.

But considering the environment's slippery nature, I don't want too much risk of falling into holes, so perhaps I should focus on safe or optimal paths while exploring where necessary. Maybe using action 1 (right) when it leads towards better immediate rewards without risking a fall, especially since in some example parameters, only action 0 is taken when on the top row.

I'm going to try an approach where in certain states near the hole, higher action numbers are assigned, and others follow more predictable patterns. Maybe for even rows or columns, taking action 2 (up), and odd ones take action 1 (right). But I need to test this by evaluating how each parameter choice affects reward collection.

After trying several combinations, I think that a policy where certain states in the top half choose up and right more often might help explore the grid without getting stuck. For example, assigning action 2 whenever possible near the edges could allow the agent to move freely while collecting rewards.

So, my proposed parameters would have higher values (like 3) when being in states that are on certain rows or columns, but I'll need to test this to see if it leads to a better reward than other combinations.
