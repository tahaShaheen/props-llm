You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) with the highest possible reward, which should be around 1.0 if we get it right.

First, I remember that the environment is slippery, meaning each action can lead to three possible directions with equal probability. This makes planning a bit tricky because the agent's path isn't entirely under its control. The policy needs to account for this uncertainty and choose actions that minimize the risk of falling into holes while maximizing the chance of reaching the goal.

Looking at the top 5 best performing params, I see that several states are mapped to specific actions. For example, state 0 (top-left) is often set to action 1 or 2. Action 1 from state 0 would lead to a move right, down, or left with equal chance, but since being in the top row can't go up, it might be safer. Similarly, other states are mapped to actions that seem to guide towards the goal while avoiding holes.

The most recent params show some variation, with different actions assigned to each state. However, their rewards aren't close to 1.0 yet, indicating we're still in the exploration phase. Since the average reward is around 0.35-0.45, which is much lower than the target, I should focus on exploring new policies rather than optimizing existing ones.

I notice that some trajectories loop or get stuck, which suggests that certain actions might be leading into cycles or risky areas. To break this, maybe changing the action for a particular state could help. For instance, if state 12 is set to action 3 (right), but that's leading it to move down, left, or up—maybe another action would be better.

I should generate a new set of params where each state's action is changed in a way that either moves towards the goal more directly or avoids known holes. Since I don't have memory of previous attempts, each iteration needs to provide maximum information gain by testing a distinct configuration.

So, for this next step, I'll create a policy where each state is assigned an action that has the highest potential to move towards the goal while considering the slippery nature. For example, in states closer to the bottom-right, choosing actions that increase the chance of moving right or down, which are essential for reaching 15.

I'll also check if any of the previous params have a similar structure and avoid them to ensure each iteration provides new data points. The aim is to explore different paths and see which one leads closer to the goal without falling into holes.
