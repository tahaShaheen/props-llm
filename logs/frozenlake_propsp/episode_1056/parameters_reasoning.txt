You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy parameters for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to maximize the reward by getting the agent to state 15 without falling into any holes. From what's given, the agent can move in four directions but because of the slippery nature, each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability.

Looking at the top params provided, most have f(params) around 0.35-0.45, which is lower than the target of 1.0. This suggests that the current policies aren't optimal yet. The recent params also show low rewards, so I'm in the exploration phase—trying to gather more information.

I notice that some states are getting stuck or not reaching the goal effectively. For example, in one trajectory, the agent keeps bouncing between states like (0,1) and (4,2), which isn't leading anywhere productive. Maybe adjusting certain state actions can help break these loops.

Let me think about key states. The starting point is state 0. If I set params[0] to action 3 (right or up or down?), but considering the movement probabilities. Wait, each action leads to three directions with equal chance. So for state 0 (top-left corner), moving right would take it towards state 1, which might be a hole? Or is that safe?

Wait, I'm not entirely sure where the holes are because they weren't specified. But from trajectories, when the agent steps on certain states, like maybe state 5 or others, it falls into a hole. So I need to ensure that for those states, the policy avoids actions leading to holes.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern in the current policies where some paths are getting stuck, so changing the action in specific states might help the agent take a different path towards the goal.

Looking at the recent params, most have low rewards, so I should focus on exploring new configurations. Maybe setting some states to always move towards the goal direction, even considering the slippery effect.

For example, if state 12 is near the bottom-right corner, setting it to action that could get closer to 15. But since the environment is slippery, I have to choose actions that statistically increase the chance of reaching the goal without falling into holes.

I think I need to adjust some key states where the current policies are leading the agent in circles or towards dangerous areas. Maybe changing params[4] from 0 to something else could help it move more effectively towards state 8, and then onwards to 12 and 15.

Alternatively, perhaps setting certain states to choose actions that have a higher probability of moving directly towards the goal, even if it's not guaranteed. Since each action has three possible outcomes, choosing an action that covers multiple directions might increase overall chances.

I should also check if any of the current policies are leading the agent into holes. For example, if state 5 is a hole, then any action from neighboring states that could lead there needs to be avoided. But without knowing exact hole locations, it's tricky.

In conclusion, since the rewards are low and I'm in the exploration phase, I'll propose a new set of params that vary significantly from previous ones, focusing on creating paths towards state 15 while avoiding known dangerous states based on trajectories.
