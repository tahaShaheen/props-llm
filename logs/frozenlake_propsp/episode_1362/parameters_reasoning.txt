You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help optimize the policy for this FrozenLake environment. It's a 4x4 grid where the agent can move in four directions, but the environment is slippery, meaning each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability. The goal is to reach state 15 (bottom-right corner) and avoid holes that end the episode.

The policy is represented by an array of 16 integers, each corresponding to a state (0-15), indicating which action to take. The actions are 0: down, left, up; 1: right, down, left; etc., as described earlier. Each param must be one of [0,1,2,3].

The reward is the episodic reward averaged over 20 episodes for each policy. The aim is to maximize this reward, with the global optimal being around 1.0.

Looking at the interaction history and the recent parameters provided, I see that several policies have been tried, but none have achieved close to the optimal reward yet. Most of them are getting around 0.35-0.45, which is below the target.

The key here is to figure out a policy that directs the agent towards the goal while avoiding holes. Since the environment is slippery, deterministic policies won't work because each action leads to multiple possible next states. So the policy needs to be designed in such a way that even with the slipperiness, it has a high probability of reaching state 15.

I notice from the recent parameters that some are getting stuck or falling into holes repeatedly. For example, policies that keep moving down might fall into certain holes, as seen in the trajectories provided. So we need to adjust these to find paths that avoid such pitfalls.

One approach is to have states near the goal (like state 15) set to actions that can reach it directly or with higher probability. Also, for other states, choosing actions that generally move towards the right and down might help, as those directions are closer to the goal.

Looking at the most recent parameters, I see some policies where certain states are taking left or up actions, which might be counterproductive. Maybe we should adjust these to push more towards right and down.

I also need to ensure that the policy doesn't repeat previous configurations. So, from the given top 7 best params and the most recent ones, I can generate new combinations by tweaking a few states' actions, especially those near the goal or in tricky positions.

After considering all this, I think adjusting the parameters for states that are close to the goal (like state 14) might help increase the reward. Also, ensuring that from other key positions, the agent moves towards directions that maximize the chance of reaching the goal without falling into holes.

So, I'll propose a new set of parameters where states near the bottom-right have actions pushing towards right and down, while others take steps to avoid known holes.
