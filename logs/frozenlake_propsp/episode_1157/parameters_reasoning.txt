You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to propose the next set of parameters for the FrozenLake environment. The goal is to help find the global optimal policy that maximizes the episodic reward. From what I understand, the environment is a 4x4 grid where the agent can move in four directions, but because it's slippery, each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability.

The agent's objective is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) for a reward of +1, while avoiding holes which end the episode. The policy is defined by an array of 16 actions, one for each state. So far, the highest reward achieved is around 0.45, but we're aiming for close to 1.0.

Looking at the most recent policies and their rewards, it seems like many are not consistently reaching the goal. The trajectories show that agents often get stuck in loops or fall into holes. For example, some policies cause the agent to repeatedly move left or right without making progress towards the goal.

I need to propose a new set of params that's different from previous ones and has the potential to reach state 15 more efficiently. Let me think about each state and what action would be most beneficial.

Starting with state 0 (top-left corner). The best action here should aim towards moving right or down, but considering the slippery nature, I need an action that gives a high chance of progressing towards the goal. Action 1 (which can move right, down, left) might be better because from state 0, moving right leads to state 1, which is closer to the goal.

For state 1, perhaps action 3 would help explore more directions, but I need to avoid getting stuck. Maybe action 2 could allow for a mix of up, right, and down, which might help in navigating around potential holes.

Looking at states near the top row (0-3), they should try moving towards the right or down. For example, state 2 might benefit from action 0, which can move down, left, or up—though since it's on the edge, maybe a different approach is needed to prevent falling into holes.

I also notice that in some policies, agents get stuck moving in circles. To avoid this, perhaps varying the actions more could help the agent explore different paths and find the goal without repetition.

Another consideration is ensuring that each action choice from a state doesn't lead to a hole with high probability. For example, if a certain action from a state often leads into a hole, the policy should choose an alternative action.

I think I need to create a params array where each state's action is chosen to maximize the chance of moving towards the goal while minimizing the risk of falling into holes. Maybe focusing on actions that have a higher probability of moving right or down from states near the top-left and then adjusting for other regions accordingly.

Also, since the agent can't remember previous attempts, I should focus on parameters that haven't been tried before to maximize information gain. Looking at past params, I see several are similar, so I need something distinct but still logical in its approach.

Putting this all together, I'll propose a new set of params where each state selects an action that primarily moves towards the goal but also varies enough to avoid loops and holes.
