You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15, which gives a reward of +1, while avoiding holes that end the episode with 0 reward.

First, I need to understand how the environment works. It's a 4x4 grid, and each state is represented by numbers from 0 to 15. The slippery nature means that when an action is taken, there are three possible directions with equal probability. Each action (left, down, right, up) has its own set of possible moves.

Looking at the history provided, I see that previous policies have been tried, but none have achieved the optimal reward of 1.0 yet. The most recent attempts have f(params) around 0.15 or lower, which is significantly below the target. This suggests that the current strategies aren't effectively reaching state 15 consistently.

The problem states that the policy should avoid holes by using previous trajectories. Since the agent can fall into holes, it's crucial to choose actions that minimize this risk while still progressing towards the goal.

I notice that in the recent trials, some policies are getting stuck or not moving efficiently. For example, one trajectory keeps moving down and right but ends up in a hole. Another gets stuck oscillating between states without making progress toward state 15.

To improve this, I should focus on creating a policy that guides the agent more directly towards the goal while avoiding dangerous areas. Maybe adjusting the actions for certain states to prioritize moves that are more likely to lead towards state 15 without getting trapped.

I'll start by examining each state and determining which action would be most effective in moving closer to state 15. For example, in state 0 (top-left corner), moving right or down could be beneficial. However, considering the slippery nature, choosing an action that has a higher probability of moving towards the goal might be better.

Looking at the best-performing params from earlier attempts, some have params[0] set to 1 or 2, which correspond to specific actions. I should consider tweaking these to see if adjusting just a few parameters can improve performance.

Since we're in iteration 698 and the maximum is 5000, there's still time for exploration. However, since recent rewards are low, perhaps it's better to switch strategies and try something more aggressive or different.

I think I'll propose a new set of params that changes some key states' actions to push towards state 15 more effectively. For example, in state 14 (which is just above the goal), choosing an action that almost certainly moves down to reach state 15. Similarly, in other states, choose actions that have higher probabilities of moving towards the right or bottom directions.

Let me draft a new set where each state's action is optimized for progress toward state 15 while avoiding holes. I'll go through each state one by one and assign the best possible action based on their position and the environment's dynamics.
