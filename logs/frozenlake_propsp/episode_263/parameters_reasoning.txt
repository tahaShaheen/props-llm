You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to help optimize the policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with the highest possible reward, avoiding the holes along the way. From what's provided, the current best policies have rewards around 0.25 or lower, which is significantly below the target of 1.0.

Looking at the recent trajectories and parameters, it seems like the agent isn't consistently finding a path to the goal without falling into holes. The most recent policies are either getting stuck in loops or not effectively navigating towards the end.

Since the global optimal reward should be around 1.0, I need to find a policy that can reliably reach state 15. From previous attempts, policies that take specific actions from certain states might have better success. For instance, moving right or down when possible could help navigate towards the goal.

I'll propose a new set of parameters where each state directs the agent towards the right or downward movements. This should guide it closer to the bottom-right corner (state 15). I need to make sure that these actions don't lead into any holes based on previous trajectories, but since there's limited info on where the holes are, I'll focus on a general path.

Let me assign each state an action that moves towards the goal. For example:

- From state 0 (top-left), moving right (action 1) or down (action 0) would be better.
- Similarly, from other states, choosing actions that lead towards increasing row and column indices.

But considering the slippery nature, I have to make sure each action choice increases the likelihood of reaching state 15 without too many retries. Maybe setting a consistent right or down direction for each state could help.

I'll outline params where each state is assigned an action likely to move it closer to the goal:

params[0]: 1 (right)
params[1]: 2 (up, but might not be ideal—maybe should go down?)
Wait, need to think about grid directions. Let me map out each state's possible moves and assign actions accordingly.

Alternatively, perhaps a policy that always tries to move right or down when possible. But since the environment is slippery, it's hard to predict exact steps. Maybe setting all states except the ones in the last row/column to move towards those directions.

I'll try assigning:

For each state:
- If not in the bottom row, prefer moving down.
- If not in the rightmost column, prefer moving right.

But since actions are 0: down, left, up; 1: right, down, left; etc., I need to map these correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps a more straightforward approach: set each state to move right or down. For example:

params[0]: 1 (right)
params[1]: 2 (up—maybe not good, but trying)
Wait, maybe it's better to have each state point towards the goal direction.

But without knowing exact hole positions, I'll proceed by setting a general path towards the goal.

After considering, I'll set params such that from states in the top rows, move down, and in other columns, move right. Let me define:

- For states 0,4,8,12: moving down (action 0 or others)
- For states not in the last column, moving right.

But each action has three possible moves, so I need to pick actions that have a high chance of moving towards the goal.

Alternatively, perhaps setting all states except those near the goal to move right or down. Let me make this concrete:

params[0]: 1 (right)
params[1]: 3 (left, but that's bad—maybe better to go down?)
Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me pick a specific set.

I think a common approach in such grid environments is to move towards the goal without getting stuck. So, perhaps setting each state to move right if possible and down otherwise. Alternatively, using a greedy policy where from each state, the action that would get closer to 15 is chosen.

But since I can't plan for exact paths due to slipperiness, maybe set all states to move in a way that tends towards the goal direction.

Alternatively, perhaps using a simple heuristic: from any state not in the last row or column, choose actions that have a chance to go right or down. But how does each action's possible moves look?

Looking back:

- Action 0 leads to [down, left, up]
- Action 1 leads to [right, down, left]
- Action 2 leads to [up, right, down]
- Action 3 leads to [left, up, right]

So for moving towards the goal (bottom-right), from a state not in the last row or column, I want actions that have a chance to go right or down.

Therefore:

- To move right: action 1 or 2 or 3
- To move down: action 0 or 1

But since the environment is slippery, each action has three possible moves. So, choosing an action that includes both right and down in its possibilities might be better.

For example, for a state not at the bottom, choosing action 0 (which can go down), but also if it's not at the far right, maybe action 1 or others that allow moving right.

Alternatively, pick actions that have high probability of moving towards the goal. For instance:

- For states in top-left area, choose action 1 (right) and 0 (down)
- For other areas, similar logic.

But since I need to assign a single action per state, perhaps it's best to assign each state an action that has the potential to move closer to the goal.

For example:

params[0] = 1 (action 1: right, down, left)
params[1] = 2 (action 2: up, right, down)
...
But I need a systematic way.

Alternatively, perhaps setting all states except those in the last row and column to action 3 or 1, which have both right and down moves.

Wait, let me think for each state:

- State 0 (top-left): best actions are right or down. Action 1: [right, down, left]. So params[0] =1
- State 1: same logic, action 1 might help move towards the goal.
But maybe action 3 would allow moving right more.

Wait, perhaps I should assign each state an action that has a higher chance to move in the desired direction. For example:

From any state not at the bottom or right edge, choose actions that include both down and right. Action 1 includes right, down, left; so choosing action 1 would have a higher chance to move towards the goal.

So for states where you're not in the last row or column, set params[i] =1 (action 1). For those in last row, set to stay (but that's a hole?), wait no, state 15 is the goal. So perhaps:

- If state is in the top rows, choose action 0 (down) or 1 (right)
- But need to map which states are safe.

Alternatively, since I don't know where the holes are, maybe assign actions that try to move towards the right and down as much as possible.

In conclusion, I'll propose a policy where most states take action 1 or 3 to have chances to move right or down, except for certain states where moving in another direction is better. Given the limited information, I'll set a variety of actions but focus on those that can potentially reach the goal without falling into holes based on previous trajectories.

After considering all this, here's my proposed params array:
</think>

params[0]: 1, params[1]: 2, params[2]: 1, params[3]: 3, params[4]: 2, params[5]: 0, params[6]: 1, params[7]: 3, params[8]: 1, params[9]: 3, params[10]: 1, params[11]: 2, params[12]: 2, params[13]: 0, params[14]: 1, params[15]: 2
