You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment with specific dynamics. The agent is a bit tricky because it can slip in all directions, which means each action leads to three possible next states instead of just one. That's going to affect how exploration works and lead to finding the best path.

First, I need to understand the environment better. It's a 4x4 grid where moving down from state 3 (the bottom row) goes back up. The goal is state 15, which is the last cell. The slippery nature of the agent means each action has some uncertainty about where it'll go next.

The policy is represented by an array of parameters [params[0], params[1], ..., params[14]], where each value determines the action when in that state (with 0 being top-left, 3 being bottom-right). Since each action can lead to three possible states with equal probability, I need to explore different paths without getting stuck in local optima.

Looking at the examples provided, some policies have higher rewards (like 1.0), but others seem worse or similar. The most recent one has a reward of 0.05 and a state where params[4] is 0, which seems like a sticking point—maybe near the top-left corner. Others have lower rewards and don't get stuck as often.

I should consider that each action in state i leads to three possible next states, so my policy needs to explore all options without getting trapped. Using techniques like Q-learning or SARSA with exploration strategies (like epsilon-greedy or Boltzmann exploration) might help. Since the rewards are fixed except for the slipping probabilities, I need a way to balance between exploring and exploiting.

I'm thinking of using an exploration strategy where in each step, there's a probability ε that the agent picks a random action instead of choosing the best-known next state. As ε decreases over time, the agent becomes more deterministic. This should help explore different paths without getting stuck immediately.

Another idea is to use Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), which is good for decision-making in games but might be computationally expensive for this problem. Alternatively, using reinforcement learning algorithms like Q-learning with averaging or SARSA with experience replay could work well since the environment's dynamics are deterministic except for slipping probabilities.

I should also consider that each action leads to three possible states, so I need to calculate the expected rewards accurately when choosing an action. For example, in state 0, taking action 2 (up) will lead to states 3, 1, and 2 with equal probability of 1/3. Similarly for other actions.

I think starting with an ε-greedy policy where ε is moderately high but decreases over time would be a good balance. I'll need to test different initial values of ε and see which gives better rewards. Maybe begin with ε=0.1, then gradually lower it as the agent explores more.

Additionally, since all other states yield 0 reward except the goal, focusing on paths that lead directly to the goal state would be beneficial. So I should prioritize exploring moves towards state 15 and exploit when possible.

I also need to make sure not to repeat the same parameters we've seen before. The user provided several top-performing parameters, so I'll avoid those to ensure a new exploration path each time.

Finally, after some experiments, if no significant improvements are found over multiple iterations, I might conclude that the global optimal policy is around 1.0, but since the examples show lower rewards in some policies, perhaps it's better to stick with an exploration-based approach focusing on different paths.
