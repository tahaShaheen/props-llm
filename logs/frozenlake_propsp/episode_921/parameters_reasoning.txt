You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best possible policy for this FrozenLake environment based on the information given. The goal is to reach state 15 with a reward of +1, and avoid the holes which end the episode immediately. 

Looking at the details provided, each action taken by the agent has a 33% chance of moving in three different directions due to the slippery nature of the environment. This means that even if the agent chooses an optimal action, there's a possibility it might not reach the intended next state. The policy needs to account for this uncertainty.

The user mentioned that the best reward achieved so far is around 0.45, which is below the target of 1.0. So, I'm in the "Explorer" phase since we're still far from the optimal reward. My goal now is to propose a new set of parameters that haven't been tried before to gather more information about the environment.

I need to make sure each state's action choice doesn't lead into a hole based on previous trajectories. From the recent attempts, some states seem problematic. For example, state 0 (top-left corner) was sometimes leading to state 4 or other directions but got stuck or fell into holes. So, I should adjust the actions for these states to avoid such outcomes.

Let me think about each state:

- State 0: Current policy has params[0] set to different values in previous trials. Maybe trying a different action here could help escape potential loops or holes.
- States along the edges (like 3,7,11) and corners might have higher risks of falling into holes, so their actions should be carefully chosen to move towards safe areas.

I'll consider setting params for each state to an action that generally moves towards the goal (right or down). However, due to the slippery nature, I need a mix of directions to increase the chance of reaching the goal without hitting a hole.

Another approach is to ensure that from each state, the agent has multiple paths to the goal. For example, from state 12 (which is row 3, column 0), moving right or up might lead towards the goal, but considering the slippery nature, we need to choose an action that allows for multiple safe transitions.

I should also look at the recent trajectories provided. The most recent one where f(params) was 0.10 had a trajectory going from (0,0) to (4,1), then (8,1), and stuck there. So maybe adjusting state 4's action could help move further towards the goal.

I think it's time to try a more aggressive policy for certain states. Maybe setting some states to always move right or down while others alternate between actions to create redundancy in paths.

Let me outline possible params:

- For states that are on the top row (0-3), moving down might be safer as they can't fall into holes above.
- States on the leftmost column (0,4,8,12) could benefit from moving right or up/down depending on their position.

After considering these factors, I'll propose a new set of params where each state is given an action that balances movement towards the goal with avoiding known risky moves. For example:

params[0] = 1 (right), which might help move towards the center.
params[4] = 2 (up or right or down?), but considering state 4 is in row 2, moving up could go to row 1, which might be safer.

Wait, I need to make sure each action for a state leads to possible states that are safe. Alternatively, perhaps setting some states to have multiple directions to increase the chance of avoiding holes.

I think it's best to propose a set of params where most states have actions that move towards the goal but also allow for some variance to avoid getting stuck in loops or falling into holes. For example:

- States near the edges might benefit from moving towards the center.
- States near the bottom-right corner (like 14 and 15) should be set to stay there or move right/up.

I'll go ahead and create a new params array that's different from previous ones, ensuring each state has an action that hasn't been tried before in combination with others. This way, we can gather more data about which paths are safe and lead towards the goal.
