You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy parameters for this FrozenLake environment using an epsilon-greedy approach with a sliding window Monte Carlo method. The goal is to reach state 15, which is the bottom right corner, and all other states give a reward of 0.

First, I need to understand the problem setup. The agent can move in four directions: down, left, up, or right. Each action has an equal probability when taking a specific action. For example, if the action is 0 (down), it chooses between moving down, left, and up with equal chance.

The policy function uses params[0] to params[15], each representing the action to take in their respective states. The current goal is to find the best parameters among [0, 1, 2, 3], but I know that a random choice might be suboptimal because the optimal strategy often involves some balance between exploring and exploiting.

Looking at the provided examples, several parameter sets achieve a reward of 1.00 or higher. For instance, params[0]: 2, params[1]: 0; others seem to explore different paths while maintaining certain transitions. I notice that using action 2 (up) is common in these optimal strategies because it might help the agent reach lower tiles quickly.

I also recall that epsilon-greedy combines exploration and exploitation by sometimes taking a random action. In this case, since the environment has some holes, the agent must explore states with lower rewards to avoid stepping on them. The current policy's epsilon value would determine how often it randomly selects an action instead of following the best-known actions.

Considering that all parameters are in [0,1,2,3], I should probably set each parameter based on their respective state transitions. For example, if certain states prefer higher-numbered actions (like 3 for down), those parameters might be set accordingly to encourage exploration of these paths.

I also think about the sliding window Monte Carlo method mentioned in the problem. This involves using recent policy evaluations to bias future explorations. So, after each evaluation, I can adjust the next action based on what's been learned so far, which should help avoid getting stuck in local optima by encouraging exploration of other paths.

Putting this together, I decide that parameters for 0 and 1 might be set to values where they explore (like 2 or 3), while higher-numbered actions (2-3) encourage moving towards the goal. This combination should balance both exploring and exploiting effectively.
