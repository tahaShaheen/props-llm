You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to maximize the reward by reaching state 15 without falling into any holes. From the problem description, I know that each action taken has a probability of moving in three directions, which makes the environment slippery.

Looking at the recent trajectories and rewards provided, it seems like most policies are giving low rewards (around 0.1 to 0.25). This suggests that the agent is not consistently reaching the goal state but might be getting stuck or falling into holes often. The optimal reward should be around 1.0, so we need a policy that can navigate effectively without hitting any traps.

I notice that in the most recent policies, the agents are either oscillating or moving towards walls where there are likely holes. For example, one trajectory went from (0,3) to (1,3), which might be a hole. Another went straight right and then down, but got stuck.

To improve this, I should design a policy that encourages movement towards the goal while avoiding known dangerous areas. Let's think about each state:

- Starting at state 0 (top-left corner). From here, moving right or down could help reach the goal. But since the environment is slippery, maybe choosing an action that has a higher chance of moving towards the right or bottom.

Wait, but each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability. So for example, if I choose action 0, it can move down, left, or up. That's not great because left and up could take it away from the goal.

Hmm, perhaps choosing actions that have a higher tendency to move towards the right or down would be better. Let me look at each possible action:

- Action 0: moves to [down, left, up]
- Action 1: moves to [right, down, left]
- Action 2: moves to [up, right, down]
- Action 3: moves to [left, up, right]

So if I choose action 2 from state 0, the agent has a higher chance to move right or down. Similarly, in other states, selecting actions that maximize the probability of moving towards the goal.

But I also need to avoid holes. From the trajectories, it seems like some central and bottom-left areas are risky. For instance, state 14 might be a hole because one trajectory ended there with low reward.

Let me map out which states are likely safe or dangerous. The goal is at 15, so that's definitely safe. Holes probably include certain states like 5, 6, 7 in the second row and some in the third row.

I think a good strategy is to have policies that guide the agent towards the right and bottom directions as much as possible, avoiding left moves unless necessary. Also, ensuring that from each state, the chosen action doesn't lead into known holes.

Looking at previous top-performing params, they mostly chose 1 or 3 for many states, but their rewards were still low. So perhaps a different approach is needed, like more greedily moving towards the goal.

Wait, but without knowing exactly where the holes are, it's tricky. However, based on the trajectories, I can infer that certain states might be near holes. For example, state 0 going right or down seems safer than left or up.

So for each state, I'll choose an action that has a higher probability of moving towards the goal (state 15). Let's plan the directions:

- State 0: should move right or down. Action 2 gives right and down options, which is better than action 1 which also includes left.
- Similarly, other states near the top-left should push towards right and down.

Continuing this logic for each state might help create a path that leads straight to the goal without hitting any holes. So I'll construct the params array accordingly, ensuring that each state's action is chosen to maximize the chance of moving closer to 15.
