You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward by reaching state 15 without falling into any holes. From the problem statement, I know that each action taken has a 33% chance of moving in one of three directions due to the slippery nature of the environment.

Looking at the previous interactions and the trajectories provided, it seems like most policies are getting stuck or not reaching the goal efficiently. The best performing policy so far has an average reward of around 0.45, which is still below the target of 1.0. This indicates that there's room for improvement in the current strategies.

I notice that several parameters have been tried, but they often lead to trajectories where the agent either falls into holes or takes a long time to reach the goal. For example, some policies cause the agent to stay in place or move in circles, which doesn't help progress towards the goal.

To maximize information gain and potentially find a better reward, I should consider a policy that directs the agent more effectively towards state 15 while avoiding holes. This likely involves setting actions that push the agent generally towards the right or downward directions since those are the paths leading to the goal (state 15 is at the bottom-right corner).

I'll need to adjust some parameters to encourage movement in these directions. For instance, in states where moving right or down leads closer to state 15 without hitting a hole, setting the corresponding action for that state might improve performance.

Given that I'm supposed to propose a new set of params values, I should choose actions that increase the likelihood of reaching state 15 while minimizing the chances of falling into holes. This means looking at each state and determining which action (0-3) would best guide the agent towards the goal without getting stuck or hitting a hole.

Since the environment is 4x4, states can be mapped as follows:

Row 0: 0,1,2,3  
Row 1: 4,5,6,7  
Row 2: 8,9,10,11  
Row 3: 12,13,14,15  

Holes are present in some states. From the trajectories, it seems that state 4 (which is row 1, column 0) might be a hole since stepping on it ends the episode. Similarly, other holes could be in states like 5 or others, but without explicit information, I have to infer based on the trajectories.

To avoid holes, the policy should encourage actions that move away from known dangerous areas. For example, if state 4 is a hole, then from states adjacent to it (like 0, which can lead to 4 when moving down or left), choosing actions that don't lead into state 4 would be better.

I'll start by setting the action for state 15 as any action since it's the goal. For other states, I need to choose actions that either move towards the right or down, depending on their position.

For example:
- In state 0 (top-left), moving right or down could be good. But if moving down leads to state 4, which might be a hole, then choosing action 1 (which allows movement right) would be safer.
- Similarly, in state 3 (top-right), the agent should move down towards state 7, but if that's a hole, maybe moving left is better.

I'll go through each state and assign actions based on this logic. I'll prioritize actions that move closer to the goal while avoiding holes as much as possible.

After considering all states, here's a potential new set of parameters. This configuration tries to guide the agent towards the right or down without stepping into known holes.
