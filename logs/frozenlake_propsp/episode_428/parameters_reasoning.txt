You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get the highest possible reward by reaching state 15, which gives +1. All other states give 0, and some are holes that end the episode.

From what I understand, each state has a policy parameter (params[i]) that determines the action taken when in that state. The actions are 0-3, corresponding to different movement options with equal probability of going three directions due to the slippery nature.

Looking at the previous top params and their rewards, it seems like most policies aren't performing very well—rewards around 0.2-0.3. The best so far is 0.30, but we're aiming for around 1.0, which would mean almost always reaching the goal.

I notice that some trajectories end quickly because they fall into holes or don't progress towards state 15 efficiently. For example, a trajectory like (0,1) (4,2) (8,2) suggests that from state 0 taking action 1 leads to state 4, which then takes action 2 to state 8, and so on. But since the reward is only 0.30, it's not great.

The recent params tried have low rewards, some even zero, indicating they might be leading into holes or getting stuck in loops. For instance, one trajectory keeps moving left and down but doesn't reach the goal.

Since I need to propose a new set of params, I should focus on states that are closer to the goal and ensure their actions guide towards state 15 without falling into holes.

Looking at state 14 (which is one step away from 15), setting it to action 3 might help because moving right would take it to 15. Similarly, for other states near the goal, ensuring that they have actions that push towards state 15.

But considering the slippery nature, the agent can't fully control direction each time—so maybe focusing on paths that have a higher probability of leading towards the goal without encountering holes.

I also need to make sure that states in areas with holes choose actions that avoid them. For example, if state 2 is adjacent to a hole, its action should minimize the chance of stepping into it.

Perhaps I can set all states near the bottom-right area (states 12-15) to take right or down actions where possible to move towards state 15. For other areas, choosing actions that gradually guide towards these regions.

I might need to test a few different configurations but given the constraints of no memory and needing to maximize information gain, I should choose params that are significantly different from previous attempts but logically make sense in guiding towards the goal.
