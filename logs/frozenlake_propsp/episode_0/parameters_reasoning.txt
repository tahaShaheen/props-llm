You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get the agent to reach state 15 (the bottom right corner) without falling into any holes. From what I understand, the environment is 4x4 with some holes that end the episode if stepped on.

First, I need to consider how the slippery nature of the environment affects movement. Each action taken by the agent doesn't always lead directly to the desired state because there's a probability of moving in other directions. For example, choosing action 0 (left) might result in moving down, left, or up with equal chance.

The policy is defined as an array of 16 integers where each index corresponds to a state and holds the action to take. The challenge here is to find the optimal set of actions that maximizes the reward, which is +1 for reaching state 15 and 0 otherwise.

Looking at the provided data, all the top 10 best-performing policies so far have resulted in an average reward of 0.00. That suggests that none of them are successfully reaching the goal consistently. The most recent policies also aren't performing better than this, which means we're likely stuck in a local optimum or not exploring effectively.

Since all previous attempts haven't yielded any positive rewards, it's clear that either the current policies aren't guiding the agent towards state 15 effectively, or they are still falling into holes. To break this cycle, I need to propose a policy that significantly changes the approach.

I think the key is to have the agent prioritize actions that move it closer to the goal while avoiding the holes. For example, from state 0 (top-left corner), moving right or down would be more strategic since those directions lead towards the goal. However, due to the slippery nature, I need to choose actions that statistically increase the chances of moving in the desired direction.

Let me consider each state and determine which action would best guide the agent towards state 15 while minimizing the risk of falling into holes:

- State 0: Top-left corner. Moving right (action 1) might be better because it can lead to state 1, which is closer to the goal.
- State 1: Top-middle. From here, moving down or right could help approach the goal.
- States along the top row should generally move towards either right or down.

But without knowing the exact positions of the holes, I have to rely on general movement towards the goal. Maybe setting a policy that encourages moving right and down more often by selecting actions that statistically push in those directions despite the slipperiness.

I'll start by suggesting a policy where each state has a 1/3 chance (due to three possible outcomes) of moving in the desired direction. For example, from state 0, choosing action 1 (right, down, left) might lead more towards right or down than staying put or moving left.

So, I'll propose setting actions that push the agent towards the goal as much as possible given the slippery nature. This might involve selecting actions that have a higher probability of moving in the desired direction when on the top row and leftmost column.

For instance:
- For states near the top (0-3), encourage right or down movements.
- For states on the left side, push towards right or down.

I'll map each state to an action that statistically increases the likelihood of moving towards the goal while avoiding edges where holes are likely present. Since all previous policies have failed, I need a bold approach to escape the current trap.
