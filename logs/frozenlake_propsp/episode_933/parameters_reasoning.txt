You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get the agent from any starting position to state 15, which gives a reward of +1. All other states give 0, and there are holes that end the episode if stepped on.

First, I need to understand the environment better. It's a 4x4 grid, so states 0-3 are the top row, 4-7 the second, 8-11 the third, and 12-15 the bottom row. The slippery nature means that each action leads to one of three possible directions with equal probability.

Looking at the params provided in the examples, I see that most policies have a reward around 0.35 or lower. Since the optimal should be around 1.0, I'm definitely not there yet. So, I need to explore more effective paths.

In the recent attempts, some trajectories end quickly by falling into holes or not reaching the goal efficiently. For instance, one trajectory went from (0,3) through several steps but ended up in a hole or looped without reaching 15. 

I think the key is to design a policy that directs the agent towards state 15 while avoiding holes. Maybe setting certain states to move directly towards the goal and others to avoid risky moves.

Looking at state 0 (top-left corner), moving right (action 1) seems logical because it leads towards the goal. Similarly, for other states near the edges, choosing actions that push towards the bottom-right direction might help.

I also notice that in previous attempts, some policies get stuck in cycles or fall into holes. So, I need to ensure that each state's action choice doesn't lead the agent into a hole with high probability.

Let me try constructing a policy where most states choose actions that move them closer to 15, perhaps prioritizing right and down movements since they bring the agent towards the goal.

I'll go through each state:

- State 0: Move right (action 1)
- State 1: Move down (action 0) or right (action 1). Maybe action 2 could help move up if needed, but let's try moving right first.
- Continue this pattern for other states, ensuring that from any position, the agent has a path towards 15 without high risk of falling into holes.

But I also need to be cautious about certain states that are near holes. For example, state 14 is adjacent to a hole (I think state 14 might lead to a hole if not careful). So, perhaps in state 14, choosing an action that moves towards the goal without risking a fall.

After considering these factors, I'll propose a new set of params where each state's action is chosen to move closer to the goal or avoid holes.
