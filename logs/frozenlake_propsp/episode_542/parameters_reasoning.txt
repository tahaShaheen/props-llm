You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I need to help find the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment using a stateless RL approach. The goal is to maximize the reward by reaching state 15 without falling into any holes.

First, let me understand the problem setup. It's a 4x4 grid with each cell represented as a state from 0 to 15. Moving actions are slippery, meaning they don't go directly where you intend but instead have an equal chance of going one of three directions depending on the action chosen.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 elements, each corresponding to a state and taking values 0-3 indicating the action to take when in that state. The challenge is to find the best possible actions for each state to maximize the average reward over 20 episodes.

Looking at the provided examples, the highest reward so far is around 0.30, which is below the target of 1.0. This suggests that we're not yet reaching the goal consistently, and there are likely issues with falling into holes or getting stuck in loops.

The last two policies tried had rewards of 0.05 and 0.10. The first of these had params where most states were set to 1, 2, or 3, except for some zeros. The second policy seems to have a mix but didn't perform much better.

To improve the reward, I should focus on two things: avoiding holes and ensuring that the agent can navigate towards state 15 effectively. Since the environment is slippery, the policy needs to account for possible drifts in movement.

Looking at the grid:

- State 0 is top-left (0,0). Possible actions from here when taking an action should move towards the goal without risking falling into a hole.
- Similarly, other states need their actions set so that, considering the slippery nature, they avoid holes and progress towards state 15.

From the initial attempts, it seems that setting certain actions might be leading to getting stuck or falling into holes. To explore further, I should propose policies that either significantly change the current strategy (exploration) or tweak the best-performing ones slightly (exploitation).

Since the rewards are still low, perhaps an exploratory approach is needed. However, since we're at iteration 542 and have some data, maybe a slight optimization based on previous results would help.

Looking at the top policies, one had params[0]:2; params[1]:3; etc., which led to a reward of 0.30. That's the highest so far, so perhaps tweaking that policy could lead to better rewards.

Alternatively, considering another approach: mapping each state to actions that would most likely move towards the goal while avoiding known holes.

For example, in state 0 (0,0), taking action 2 (which is 'right, down, up' with equal probability) might help move towards either right or down. But I need to ensure it doesn't lead into a hole.

Another thought: perhaps some states should be set to stay still (but wait, in this setup, all actions cause movement). So maybe the best approach is to find paths that are less risky.

Given the agent's movement probabilities, each action from a state leads to three possible next states. The optimal policy should choose the action that maximizes the probability of eventually reaching the goal without hitting a hole.

Since I don't have the exact layout of the holes, but based on trajectories provided, I can infer that certain movements lead to failures. For instance, if moving right from state 0 leads to a hole, then params[0] should avoid action leading to right.

But since in the first trajectory example, (0,1) was taken and led to state 4, which is safe, perhaps action 1 (which has right as one of its options) is acceptable if it doesn't lead into a hole.

Alternatively, maybe setting states near the goal to take actions that directly target the goal would help. For example, in state 12 (bottom-left), moving right or up could be beneficial.

Given all this, perhaps the optimal policy involves:

- States closer to the goal taking actions that directly aim towards it.
- Avoiding actions that lead into known dangerous areas.
- Considering that each action has a 33% chance of going in three directions, so the policy needs to cover those possibilities.

Looking at the last two policies tried, both had low rewards. Maybe adjusting some key states' actions could help. For example, in state 0, changing from 1 or 2 to another action might lead to a better path.

Alternatively, perhaps setting all states towards moving right and down as much as possible would guide the agent towards the goal at (3,3) which is state 15.

But given the slippery nature, this approach could be risky. Maybe using dynamic programming to compute the best actions for each state based on their expected rewards would help, but without that capability here, I need to reason it out.

Given that we're in iteration 542 and have a lot left, perhaps exploring another parameter configuration that significantly changes some key states' actions could provide new information about which paths are safe or lead closer to the goal.
