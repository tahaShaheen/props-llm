You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment based on the information given. Let's start by understanding the problem.

The environment is a 4x4 grid with states numbered from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). The goal is to reach state 15, which gives a reward of +1, while all other states give 0. However, there are holes that cause the episode to end if stepped on.

The agent's actions are tricky because each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability due to the slippery nature of the environment. For example, moving left (action 0) can result in down, left, or up moves. This makes planning more complex since the next state isn't deterministic based on the action taken.

Given that the policy is represented by an array of 16 values (params[0] to params[15]), each indicating the action to take from that state, my goal is to find the optimal set of actions that maximizes the reward. The maximum possible reward per episode is 1.0 if the agent successfully reaches state 15 without falling into a hole.

Looking at the provided data:

- The top 6 best-performing policies all yield an average reward of around 0.45, which suggests that none have reached the goal yet or are consistently getting stuck.
- The most recent three params had lower rewards (0.00 and 0.15), indicating they might not be effective.

Since we're at iteration 1377 out of 5000, it's crucial to balance exploration and exploitation. However, the current best reward is still below 0.5, which is significantly less than the target of 1.0. This suggests that I should adopt an exploratory strategy rather than exploiting known good policies.

To maximize information gain, I need to propose a new set of params that hasn't been tried before and could potentially lead to reaching state 15 without hitting any holes. One approach is to ensure that each state's action choice increases the likelihood of moving towards the goal while avoiding dangerous states (holes).

Let me think about the structure of the grid:

- The agent starts at state 0 (top-left). From here, they need to move right or down.
- Each action has a 1/3 chance of going in each direction. So, choosing actions that generally point towards the goal might increase the chances of eventually reaching it.

I should map out the grid and determine for each state which action would best guide the agent towards state 15 while considering possible slippery movements.

For example:
- State 0: Should move right (action 1) or down (action 3). But since action 1 could lead to moving right, down, or left. Alternatively, action 3 could lead to down, left, or up.
Wait, actually, each action leads to three possible directions. So I need to choose actions that have a higher probability of moving in the desired direction.

Looking at action definitions:

- Action 0: moves down, left, or up.
- Action 1: moves right, down, or left.
- Action 2: moves up, right, or down.
- Action 3: moves left, up, or right.

So for state 0 (top-left), to move towards the goal (right and down), action 1 (which includes right) is better. But I need to make sure that from other states, similar logic applies.

Let me attempt to create a policy where each state's action is chosen to generally push the agent towards the bottom-right direction, while avoiding holes.

But without knowing which specific states are holes, this becomes challenging. However, based on the trajectories provided in the top 6 params, I can infer some potential dangerous states.

Looking at the trajectories:

- One trajectory ends quickly: (0,1) → (4,2) → ... It seems that moving down from state 0 leads to state 4.
- Another trajectory: (0,3) → ... which might be a move up, but since it's the top row, moving up would stay in the same state or perhaps wrap around? Wait, no, in FrozenLake, moving beyond grid boundaries probably stays in place. So, for state 0, action 3 (which includes left and up) could loop.

But without knowing which states are holes, I have to make educated guesses based on trajectories that have led to success or failure.

Given the current best reward is around 0.45, it's clear that agents are sometimes reaching close but not the goal. Perhaps they're getting stuck in loops or falling into holes.

So, perhaps a better strategy would be to have each state point towards the right or down direction as much as possible.

For example:

- From states on the top row (0-3), prefer actions that move right or down.
- From leftmost column (0,4,8,12), prefer down or right.
- From other positions, choose actions that tend to move towards the goal.

Let me try to outline this:

State 0: action 1 (right)
State 1: action 3 (right is possible)
State 2: action 2 (could move up, but might want to go down)
Wait, perhaps it's better to map each state based on their position.

Alternatively, perhaps a greedy approach where from each state, the agent tries to move towards the goal. For example:

- If not in the bottom row, prefer moving down.
- If not in the rightmost column, prefer moving right.

But given the slippery nature, this might not always work, but it's a starting point.

Another consideration is avoiding holes. Since some trajectories end quickly or in loops, perhaps certain actions from specific states lead to holes. Therefore, we need to adjust those states' policies to avoid such outcomes.

Given that the recent params had low rewards, maybe their action choices led to falling into holes. So, I should change the actions for those states to different ones.

Putting it all together, I'll create a new set of params where each state's action is chosen to move generally towards the goal and avoid likely dangerous moves based on previous trajectories.

Let me draft some specific values:

- State 0: Action 1 (right)
- State 1: Action 3 (right)
- State 2: Action 2 (down or right)
Wait, but in the initial problem statement, action numbers correspond to different movement sets. Let's double-check:

Action 0: down, left, up
Action 1: right, down, left
Action 2: up, right, down
Action 3: left, up, right

So for each state, I need to pick an action that gives the best chance of moving towards the goal.

For example:

- State 0 (top-left): Action 1 (right is a possible move)
- State 1 (top-middle): Action 1 (right and down)
- State 2 (top-right): Since it's already on the top row, maybe action 3 (which includes right but could also go up or left) isn't helpful. Alternatively, action 0 to go down.
Wait, state 2 is at (0,2). To move towards the goal, moving down is better.

But considering that in state 2, taking action 1 would allow moving right into state 3, but since it's already on the top row, moving right might not change anything. Alternatively, moving down to state 6.

So perhaps for state 2: Action 0 (down) which includes down as a possible move.

Similarly:

- State 3: On the top-right corner. From here, action 2 could be useful since it allows moving up or right or down. But moving right isn't possible, so maybe down is better.
But wait, state 3 is (0,3). Action 2's possible moves are up, right, down. Since right would stay in the same column but next row (state 7), perhaps action 2 is better.

Wait, no, from state 3, moving right would take it to state 7? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the grid numbering. Let me clarify:

The grid is numbered as follows:
- Top row: 0,1,2,3
- Second row:4,5,6,7
- Third row:8,9,10,11
- Bottom row:12,13,14,15

So from state i, moving down would add 4 to the current state number. Moving right increases by 1 (if not on the last column). Left decreases by 1, etc.

Therefore:

- From state 0 (top-left), moving right goes to 1, down goes to 4.
- So action 1 from state 0: possible moves are right (to 1), down (4), or left (stays at 0? Or perhaps it's undefined; in FrozenLake, moving left from the first column might stay in place).

But given the slippery nature, when taking an action, there's a chance to move in three directions. So from state 0, action 1 has a 1/3 chance of moving right (to 1), down (4), or left (stays at 0? Or perhaps goes back to 0).

Wait, no: in standard FrozenLake, moving beyond the grid doesn't change the state. So if you're at state 0 and move left, you stay at 0.

Therefore, from state 0, action 1 can take you to 1 (right), 4 (down), or stay at 0 (left).

So for state 0, choosing action 1 increases the chance of moving towards the goal (either right or down) compared to other actions.

Similarly, in state 1: taking action 3 could move it up, right, or left. But since it's on row 0, moving up would stay at 1. So perhaps better to take action 1 again (right, down, left), which allows moving towards the goal.

But I need to make sure that from each state, the chosen action doesn't lead into a hole. Without knowing where the holes are, this is tricky, but based on previous trajectories, some states might be dangerous.

Looking at the most recent params:

One of them had all actions set to 2,3,0 etc., and resulted in low reward. So perhaps certain actions from specific states lead to holes.

Another approach is to ensure that each state's action choice has a path towards the goal without getting stuck. Maybe a policy where all states try to move down or right as much as possible.

Let me draft the params step by step:

State 0 (top-left): Action 1 (right, down, left)
State 1: Action 3 (right, up, left) but since it's on top row, up doesn't help. Maybe action 1 again.
Wait, but action 3 allows moving right with probability 1/3.

Alternatively, perhaps each state should choose the action that has the highest chance of leading towards the goal. For example:

- States not in the last column: prefer actions that can move right or down.
- States not in the bottom row: prefer actions that can move down.

Looking at the four possible actions and their movement sets:

Action 0 (down, left, up)
Action 1 (right, down, left)
Action 2 (up, right, down)
Action 3 (left, up, right)

For states in column 0 (except bottom row), moving right is essential. So action 1 or 3.

But for state 0:

- Action 1: can move right to 1, down to 4, or left stay at 0.
So choosing action 1 gives a chance to move towards the goal.

For state 1:

- Action 1: right (to 2), down (5), or left (back to 0).
Alternatively, action 3: right (to 2), up (stay at 1), or left (to 0).

So perhaps action 1 is better for state 1.

Similarly, for state 2:

- Action 1: right stays at 2? Or moves beyond? Wait, no, in FrozenLake, moving right from the last column doesn't change. So from state 3, which is (0,3), moving right would stay at 3. Therefore, action 1 for state 3 might not be useful.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing columns and rows.

Actually, each row has four states, so:

- Row 0: 0 (leftmost), 1, 2, 3 (rightmost)
- Row 1:4,5,6,7
- etc.

So from state 3 (row 0, column 3): moving right would stay at 3. So action 1's possible moves are right (stays), down (7), or left (to 2).

Therefore, for state 3, choosing action 1 could move down to 7, which is in row 1, column 3.

So perhaps for states on the top row but not at the end, it's better to choose actions that can lead down.

Similarly, for states in the last column (state 3,7,11,15):

- From state 3: action 1 or 2 could be useful.
But since the goal is state 15, perhaps moving down is better.

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe it's better to look for existing optimal policies for FrozenLake and adapt them.

In standard FrozenLake without slipping, the optimal policy can be found using methods like Q-learning or SARSA. However, here the environment is slippery, making it more challenging because actions are stochastic.

I recall that in such environments, a greedy approach might not work well due to uncertainty, but perhaps a risk-averse strategy would help.

Another thought: since each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability, maybe the optimal policy should choose actions that maximize the expected reward. Since only state 15 gives +1, we need to find paths that have a high chance of reaching it without hitting holes.

Given that, perhaps focusing on states near the goal and working backwards would help. But since I don't know which are holes, this is difficult.

Alternatively, I can try to create a policy where from each state, the agent has some probability of moving towards the goal and avoids likely dangerous actions based on previous trajectories.

Looking back at the recent params that performed poorly:

One had all states set to 2,3,0 etc., resulting in low reward. Maybe that's because certain actions led into holes.

So perhaps adjusting those states' actions could help.

Another approach is to randomize the policy a bit more to explore new trajectories, especially since we're still below the target reward of 1.0.

Given all this, I think it's best to propose a new set of params that systematically moves the agent towards the goal while avoiding known dangerous paths based on previous attempts.
