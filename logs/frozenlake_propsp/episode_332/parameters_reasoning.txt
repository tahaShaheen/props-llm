You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what the optimal policy is for this FrozenLake environment. So, the agent is on a 4x4 grid, and it's slippery, meaning each action has three possible outcomes with equal probability. The goal is state 15 (bottom-right corner), which gives +1 reward, while other states give 0. There are holes that end the episode if stepped on.

First, I need to understand where the holes are because they can cause the agent to fail. From the trajectories provided, I can see some paths leading to failures or getting stuck. For example, one trajectory went from (0,3) and then through various states before ending at (10,1), which might be a hole.

Looking at the top 5 best-performing params, their average reward is around 0.25, which is quite low. The goal is to reach around 1.0, so clearly these aren't optimal yet. The recent attempts are getting even lower rewards, like 0.05 or 0.00, which suggests the agent isn't consistently reaching the goal.

I need to find a policy that navigates towards state 15 while avoiding holes. Since the environment is slippery, the agent's actions aren't guaranteed, so it needs policies that increase the chances of moving in the desired direction despite the slipperiness.

Let me analyze some trajectories:

- The first top param had a trajectory (0,1) → (4,2) → (8,2). This suggests moving down-right but ended without reaching 15. Maybe the policy wasn't guiding towards the end.
- Another top param's trajectory was short and didn't reach the goal, indicating maybe it's stuck or not effectively navigating.

In recent attempts, some policies led to longer paths but still didn't reach the goal, possibly because of getting stuck in loops or falling into holes. For example, a policy that kept moving left or up might be going around in circles near state 0 or state 1.

I should think about how each action leads to possible states and choose actions that maximize the chance of moving towards 15 while avoiding dangerous areas (holes). Since each action has three possible outcomes, I can assign actions that have a higher probability of leading closer to 15.

For example, in the top-left corner (state 0), moving right or down would be beneficial. But since it's slippery, choosing an action that increases the chance of moving towards the goal is better. Maybe action 1 (which has possible moves: right, down, left) could work because from state 0, moving right leads to state 3, which is still in the top row but closer to the end.

Wait, no—state 3 is on the top row, so maybe it's better to move down. So action 1 includes down as a possibility, increasing the chance of moving towards the goal.

I should map out each state and decide the best action to take considering all possible outcomes. Since I can't remember previous attempts (as per the rules), I need to make sure each proposed policy is unique and hasn't been tried before.

Looking at the recent params, some have used actions that might not be optimal. For instance, a param set where almost every state is action 0 or 1 might be too conservative and not push towards the goal enough.

I think a good approach would be to create a policy where each state's action is chosen to maximize the probability of moving right or down (towards 15) as much as possible. But I have to ensure that from any given state, the chosen action doesn't lead into known holes.

For example:

- State 0: choose an action that has a high chance of going down or right.
- State 3: choosing an action that goes right would take it to state 7, but if there's a hole there, maybe it's better to go down instead.

But without knowing the exact positions of holes, I have to infer from the trajectories. From the given data, some states are dangerous because agents fall into them. For instance, state 10 might be a hole since one trajectory ended at (10,1).

So, in such cases, I need to adjust the policy to avoid actions that could lead to those holes.

Perhaps using a combination of right and down actions would help navigate towards the goal without falling into traps. Also, ensuring that from each state, there's a path that can reach 15 without hitting any holes.

I should structure the policy such that each action in the state leads closer to 15 as much as possible, considering the slipperiness and avoiding known dangerous states.

Maybe start by setting the goal state (15) to stay put or move towards completing, but since it's the end, perhaps no action is needed. For other states near the bottom-right corner, actions should push towards that area.

In summary, I need to propose a params array where each state has an action that either moves down or right with as much probability as possible, avoiding holes and increasing chances of reaching 15.
