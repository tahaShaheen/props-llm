You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Alright, I'm trying to find the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment using a global optimizer. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) with the highest reward possible, which is +1. All other states give a reward of 0. The agent starts at state 0 and can move in four directions, but each action leads it randomly to three possible next states when the environment is slippery.

First, I need to understand how the policy is parameterized. Each state corresponds to an element in the params array, with length 16 (since there are 4x4=16 states). The values of these elements are either 0, 1, 2, or 3, each representing a specific action: down, right, up, left respectively.

The challenge is that without knowing which parameter combination leads to the highest reward, I have to explore various configurations. Since the agent can fall into holes if it steps on them, my policy must avoid these by exploring through previous trajectories and picking actions that don't lead into unknown or risky areas.

I start with initial parameters set to 0,1,2,3 for each state. This represents all actions being chosen uniformly at random according to the given action selection rules. But this setup might not account for the slippery nature of the environment correctly, as the movement probabilities aren't uniform across directions.

The agent's performance is evaluated based on the episodic reward f(params) over 400 iterations. Each iteration it's sampled from the last 15 or most recent parameters. The best performing params are among these samples, and I need to improve upon them by exploring new parameter values that avoid previously encountered holes.

I realize that since the environment is small, but with slippery transitions, the optimal policy might require a more nuanced approach. It's likely that certain actions (like moving right or left) should be taken less frequently when in specific states, especially if those areas are known to have holes.

I decide to test some parameter configurations from the top performing ones provided earlier. For instance, params[0]=2 means action 0 is chosen most often for state 0. However, I suspect that this might lead the agent into a hole because of the slippery movements. So I adjust parameters around these values but ensure they don't accidentally trigger the hole.

I also consider whether the policy's exploration strategy should focus on the worst-case scenarios or more balanced actions. Since the environment is small, maybe trying out all possible action combinations for each state could help find a configuration that avoids dangerous areas and maximizes rewards.

Another consideration is using reinforcement learning techniques like Q-learning or SARSA to update parameters based on experience. But since we're exploring via trajectories, perhaps an epsilon-greedy approach with some exploration might be necessary, but in this case, since the environment has deterministic slippery transitions, it might require a more strategic exploration of parameter values.

I also think about how frequently each action should be taken across all states. For example, if state 0 is known to have holes when moving up or down, perhaps I should adjust params[2] (up) and params[1] (right) to avoid those dangerous directions more often. This requires careful analysis of where the agent falls into unknown areas.

Additionally, I need to make sure that my policy doesn't exploit any local maximums while still exploring new regions in parameter space. This balance is crucial because if my policy becomes too focused on certain actions due to exploitation, it might miss better global configurations.

I decide to start by evaluating a few specific parameter sets from the top performing ones and see how they perform. For example, taking params where action 0 (down) is taken more often than other actions in state 0 could help the agent avoid falling into holes, but I must ensure that other states don't have similar issues.

Testing these parameter configurations might reveal if certain actions are consistently mislead by the slippery movements, prompting a reevaluation of how to balance action selection for optimal reward gathering. 

Overall, my strategy is to systematically test and adjust parameters based on observed performance during exploration, ensuring that I explore both safer and potentially better paths in the state space.
