You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to optimize the policy parameters for the FrozenLake environment described. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) and get a reward of +1, while avoiding holes that end the episode.

First, I need to understand the environment better. It's a 4x4 grid where each cell represents a state from 0 to 15. Movement actions are slippery, meaning when you take an action (like moving right), there's a 33% chance it could be one of three possible directions: for example, action 0 can lead the agent to move down, left, or up with equal probability.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 elements, each corresponding to the action taken in that state. The challenge is to find the optimal set of actions across all states to maximize the average reward over 20 episodes.

Looking at the provided information:

- The top-performing policies have rewards around 0.35 to 0.45, which are below the target of 1.0.
- The trajectories show that many policies either get stuck in loops or fall into holes before reaching state 15.

Since I'm acting as a stateless optimizer, I can't remember previous attempts, so each suggestion must be based on maximizing information gain and avoiding previously seen parameters.

One approach is to exploit the best-performing policies but tweak them slightly. For example, looking at the top params:

- They have certain patterns in their action selections, possibly favoring actions that might lead closer to state 15 but sometimes getting stuck or falling into holes.
  
I should consider modifying these policies to encourage more direct paths towards the goal while reducing risks of hitting holes. Alternatively, if no policies are performing well, I might need to explore new parameter configurations.

Another consideration is ensuring that each policy avoids known holes as much as possible based on previous trajectories. For example, certain states have high probabilities of leading to failure, so their actions should be adjusted to avoid those paths.

Given the current state of top policies and recent attempts yielding low rewards (including zero in some cases), I might need to take a more exploratory approach rather than exploiting existing near-optimal solutions. This means suggesting entirely new parameter configurations that haven't been tried before but have potential to reach higher rewards.

Alternatively, if some policies are already close to optimal, fine-tuning their actions could push the reward closer to 1.0.

I should also note the trajectories provided. For instance, one trajectory went (0,1) → (0,1) → (4,2) → (8,2). This suggests that from state 0 taking action 1 leads to state 4 or perhaps another, and so on. Maybe adjusting these transitions could help reach state 15 more efficiently.

Perhaps I should focus on states closer to the goal and ensure their actions are set to move towards the right or down as much as possible without leading into holes. For example, for state 12 (bottom-left), choosing action that mostly moves right (action 3) might be beneficial.

Also, considering the slippery nature, each action's effect is probabilistic, so the policy must account for multiple possible outcomes and select actions that statistically lead towards the goal with higher probability while minimizing risk of hitting holes.

In summary, my strategy should involve:

1. Identifying states near the goal (like 12-15) and ensuring their policies encourage movement right or down.
2. Avoiding actions in other states that might loop or lead into holes based on previous trajectories.
3. Proposing new parameter configurations that haven't been tried yet, especially if current rewards are low.
4. Possibly tweaking the best existing parameters to refine their performance.

Now, I'll generate a new set of parameters that avoids previously seen configurations and tries to maximize the chance of reaching state 15 while minimizing hole risks.
