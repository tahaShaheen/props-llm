You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, let's try to figure out the best next step for the policy parameters in this FrozenLake environment. So far, I've seen that all the top-performing policies are giving pretty low rewards around 0.15 or lower. That suggests we're not close to the optimal reward of 1.0 yet, so I should act as an Explorer and try out new configurations instead of tweaking existing ones.

Looking at the recent trajectories, most of them end quickly either by reaching the goal or falling into a hole. Since the agent can move in multiple directions with equal probability due to the slippery nature, it's crucial that each state's action choice leads towards the goal without risking falling into a hole.

One thing I notice is that many current policies are not leading the agent towards state 15 effectively. For example, some trajectories get stuck in loops or end up in states that don't progress towards the goal. So maybe I should focus on setting actions that push the agent closer to state 15 regardless of the slippery effect.

I should consider each state and choose an action that maximizes the chance of moving right or down, which are the directions leading towards state 15. Since the environment is slippery, choosing actions that have a higher probability of those desired movements could help. For instance, if an action leads to a mix of right, down, and another direction, it might be better than an action that doesn't push towards the goal.

Let me think about each state:

- State 0 (top-left): Moving right or down would be best. Looking at the possible actions:
  - Action 0: Down, Left, Up
  - Action 1: Right, Down, Left
  - Action 2: Up, Right, Down
  - Action 3: Left, Up, Right

So, action 1 has a right option, which is good. Action 2 also includes right and down. Maybe choosing action 2 for state 0 could push the agent more towards the right or down.

Similarly, for other states like 4 (top-middle), moving right might help, so checking which actions offer that possibility would be beneficial.

I'll go through each state and assign an action that has a higher chance of moving the agent towards the goal. This should help in exploring new paths and potentially finding a trajectory that reaches state 15 without falling into holes.

After evaluating all states, I'll propose a new set of params where each state is assigned the best possible action based on the directions leading to the goal.
