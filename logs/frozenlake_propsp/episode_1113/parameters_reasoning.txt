You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best way to help find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me start by understanding the problem thoroughly.

The environment is a 4x4 grid with states numbered from 0 to 15. The goal is state 15, which gives a reward of +1. All other states give 0. There are holes in some states that end the episode if stepped on. The slippery nature means each action taken has a 33% chance to go one of three directions.

The policy is an array of 16 elements (params), where each element corresponds to an action (0-3) for each state. My goal is to find the optimal params that maximize the episodic reward, ideally around 1.0.

Looking at the interaction history provided, I see that so far, the best policies have f(params) values averaging around 0.45, which is below 1. So, we're not yet near the optimal reward. This suggests we need to explore more rather than exploit what's working a bit.

The user mentioned that I should act as an "Explorer" since the rewards are far below 1.0. That means I shouldn't tweak existing policies but instead propose new ones distinct from previous attempts to gather more information about the environment, especially identifying holes and the best paths to the goal.

Looking at the trajectories provided, it seems some states lead to immediate falls into holes or long loops without reaching the goal. For example, in one trajectory, the agent kept taking action 0 from state 0, which might be leading it down a path with more risks.

I need to propose a new set of params that explores different paths and avoids known dangerous areas. Maybe I should focus on actions that move towards the goal while considering possible slippery movements. For example, moving right or down (actions 1 and 2) from certain states might be better than others if they have a higher chance of reaching state 15.

I also notice that in previous policies, some states were not being handled optimally, leading to getting stuck or falling into holes. So, I should adjust the actions for those critical states to avoid such outcomes.

Let me think about each state and what action might be best:

- State 0 (top-left corner): Moving right or down would be better since moving up isn't possible. Let's choose an action that has a chance to move towards the goal. Action 1 includes right, down, left. Maybe action 1 is good here.

- States near the edges: For example, state 3 (top-right) should probably move down or right if possible. But since it's on the edge, moving down might be safer. Let's pick action 2 or 3 for states on the top row to encourage downward movement.

Wait, considering the slippery nature, each action leads to three possibilities. So, choosing an action that has a higher chance of moving towards the goal is better. For example, in state 0, taking action 1 (which includes right) could help move towards the goal.

I should also ensure that for states near the holes, the policy avoids actions that might lead into them. For instance, if state 4 is next to a hole, choosing an action that moves away from it would be better.

Given all this, I'll propose a new set of params where each state's action is chosen to encourage movement towards the goal while avoiding risky paths. Since previous policies didn't reach high rewards, changing as many parameters as possible from the top-performing ones could help explore new trajectories and find holes or better pathways.
