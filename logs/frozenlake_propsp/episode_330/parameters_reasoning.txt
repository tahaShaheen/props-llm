You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to choose the optimal policy parameters for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with a reward of +1 and avoid holes that will end the game. The policy is based on an array where each element represents the action taken when in the corresponding state.

First, I need to understand the problem setup. The agent is in a 4x4 grid, so there are 16 states numbered from 0 to 15. The actions are moving left, down, right, or up, with some constraints based on the policy parameters. Each parameter can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.

The key here is that the current policies are not optimal and need improvement. From the provided examples, it seems like using higher numbers (like 2, 3) in certain states leads to better performance, especially avoiding holes. So I should focus on exploring which action sequences avoid these holes.

Holes start from row 1 and end at column 3 for the top row (state 1). In row 2, hole is at state 5. Row 3 has a hole at state 8. The goal is to reach state 15 without stepping on these holes, which are essentially obstacles.

Since I'm supposed to choose from [0,1,2,3], I need to experiment with each parameter for the first few states and see how they perform. Maybe by trial and error, I can find a policy that avoids all holes.

I'll start by testing parameters where action 3 is taken in certain states. For example, if state 0 takes action 3 (up), that might help avoid the top hole. Similarly, for other top rows, sometimes taking action 2 or 3 helps prevent falling into the hole at row 1.

Let me make a list of top parameters where holes occur and see how the actions there are handled. For instance, in state 0 (top-left), if I take action 3, that's up, but from state 0, moving up would take me to state 4, which is safe. In state 1 (top-center), taking action 2 or 3 might avoid the hole at row 1.

By systematically testing these parameter combinations and observing how they perform in reaching the goal, I can identify a set that avoids holes effectively and maximizes rewards without getting stuck in them.
