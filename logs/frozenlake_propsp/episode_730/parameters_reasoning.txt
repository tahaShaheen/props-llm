You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, let me try to figure this out step by step. So, I'm trying to help find the optimal policy for a FrozenLake environment using a stateless RL approach. The goal is to reach the bottom-right corner (state 15) without falling into any holes. 

First, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. The agent can move in four directions but due to the slippery nature, each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability. This means that from a given state, taking an action doesn't guarantee movement in one specific direction; instead, it's a probabilistic outcome.

Looking at the parameters provided, each `params[i]` corresponds to an action for state i (ranging from 0 to 15). The possible actions are 0, 1, 2, or 3. My task is to propose new parameter configurations that haven't been tried before, focusing on maximizing information gain about the environment.

From the history provided, I see several attempts and their corresponding rewards. The best reward so far is 0.45, which is still below the target of 1.0. This indicates that the current policies are not reliably reaching the goal or avoiding holes consistently.

To approach this, I need to consider two main strategies: exploration and exploitation. Since the rewards aren't close to optimal yet, we're in the exploration phase. Therefore, I should suggest parameters that explore new paths or avoid previously problematic states.

Looking at the trajectories provided, it seems like the agent often gets stuck in loops or moves away from the goal. For example, some trajectories show repeated actions leading to no progress towards state 15. This suggests that the current policies might not have effective strategies for navigating towards the goal efficiently.

I should consider configurations that encourage movement towards state 15. Since the grid is slippery, it's crucial to choose actions that increase the probability of moving closer to the goal despite the randomness. For instance, from state 0 (top-left), choosing an action that has a higher chance of moving down or right could be beneficial.

I also notice that some states might lead directly to holes if not navigated carefully. Therefore, each parameter should ensure that the chosen action avoids such pitfalls as much as possible given the probabilistic nature of movement.

To propose new parameters, I'll consider assigning actions that generally move towards state 15 from each state. For example:
- From state 0 (top-left), moving right or down would help progress towards the goal.
- From states closer to the bottom-right, taking actions that increase the likelihood of reaching state 15.

I'll create a new configuration where each state's action is set to one that has the highest chance of moving towards state 15. Since the movement is probabilistic, I need to choose actions that maximize the chance of getting closer despite the slipperiness.

Let me outline some key states and their optimal actions:
- State 0: Moving right or down could be better.
- States near the top row might benefit from moving down.
- Middle states should prioritize moving towards the bottom-right direction.

I'll create a new set of parameters where each state's action is selected based on maximizing the movement towards the goal, considering the possible directions each action can take. This might involve setting actions that have right or down movements as primary options for upper rows and similar logic for lower rows.

After considering all this, I'll draft a new set of parameters ensuring no repetition with previous attempts and covering different paths to explore.
