You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help optimize a policy for the FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with maximum reward. From the problem description, the environment is slippery, meaning each action taken can lead to three possible directions with equal probability. There are holes in the grid that end the episode if stepped on.

Looking at the previous interactions and the provided data, it seems like all the top-performing policies so far have an average reward around 0.45 or lower. The best I've seen is 0.45. Since the optimal reward should be around 1.0, we're still in the exploration phase because the rewards are not close to the target.

The recent params show that there's been a lot of variation, but no consistent high reward yet. So, as an Explorer, I need to propose new parameters that haven't been tried before to gather more information about which actions lead closer to the goal without falling into holes.

I notice that in some previous attempts, the agent tends to loop or get stuck near certain states, like state 0. This suggests that maybe changing the action for state 0 could help. For example, if state 0 is set to move right instead of down, it might avoid getting stuck there.

Looking at the grid layout, state 0 is the top-left corner. From there, moving right (action 1) or down (action 0) are primary options. Since the environment is slippery, choosing an action that has a higher chance of moving towards the goal or avoiding holes is crucial.

I'll consider changing some key states' actions to see if they can lead the agent towards state 15 more effectively. For instance, ensuring that when near the edges, the policy encourages movement towards the right or down to approach the goal.

After evaluating possible changes and considering past trajectories, I decide to adjust a few parameters. Specifically, I'll set certain states to actions that push the agent towards the bottom-right direction. This includes setting state 0 to action 1 (right), state 4 to action 3 (which has a mix of right, down, left), and others to encourage downward or rightward movement.

This new configuration aims to guide the agent more directly towards the goal while minimizing the chance of falling into holes by avoiding loops and unnecessary backtracking.
