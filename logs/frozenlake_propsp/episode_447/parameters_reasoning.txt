You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) and get a reward of +1, while avoiding the holes which end the episode immediately.

First, I need to understand how the slippery environment works. When an action is taken, the agent has a 33% chance to move in one of three directions depending on the action chosen. For example, choosing action 0 gives equal probability to move down, left, or up. This makes the environment stochastic, so the same action might lead to different states.

Looking at the previous top-performing policies and their trajectories, I notice that most have low rewards around 0.2 to 0.3, which are far below the target of 1.0. This suggests that we're in an exploration phase since the rewards aren't close to optimal yet. 

The recent params tried include a lot of 2s and 3s, but their trajectories either loop or fall into holes quickly. For example, one policy with many 2s led to a trajectory that kept moving down and right but didn't reach the goal. Another policy with more 1s and 3s had similar issues.

To explore more effectively, I should consider policies that have different action patterns in key states. Maybe some states need to prioritize certain directions more than others. For instance, state 0 (top-left) might benefit from moving right or down, while state 14 (second-to-last in the third row) might need a specific action to reach state 15.

I should also check which states are holes. From the trajectories provided, it seems that some transitions lead to failures quickly, indicating where the holes are. For example, moving left from state 0 might lead to a hole, so params[0] shouldn't choose actions that would likely take it there.

Considering all this, I think experimenting with different action assignments in critical states like 0, 7, 14, and 15 could yield better results. Maybe setting some states to always move right or down when possible to push towards the goal without getting stuck in loops or falling into holes.

I'll propose a new set of params where each state has a mix of actions aimed towards moving towards the goal but also considering the stochastic nature. For example, state 0 could choose action 1 (which can lead it right, down, or left) to try and move towards either right or down. Similarly, states closer to the goal should prioritize actions that increase the chance of reaching state 15.

After thinking through possible transitions and avoiding known holes, I'll craft a new params array where each state selects an action that maximizes the probability of moving towards the goal without getting stuck.
