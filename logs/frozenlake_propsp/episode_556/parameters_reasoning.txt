You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me think through how to approach this step by step.

First, I know that the goal is state 15, which gives a reward of +1. All other states give 0, except if you fall into a hole. The grid is 4x4, so there are 16 states in total (0-15). The agent can move left, down, right, or up, but the environment is slippery. So when an action is taken, it doesn't always go as planned—it has a 33% chance to go in one of three directions.

The policy is defined by an array called params, where each element corresponds to a state and specifies the action to take. The values are 0-3, corresponding to the four possible actions. My task is to propose a sequence of these params arrays to maximize the episodic reward, which should ideally be around 1.0 if we find the optimal policy.

Looking at the history provided, I can see that so far the best performing policies have an average reward of around 0.30, and others are lower. The goal is to get closer to 1.0, which suggests that we're not yet exploiting effectively but need to explore more or optimize based on previous results.

The user mentioned that the optimal policy should be found by proposing params arrays that either explore new configurations (if rewards are low) or tweak the best ones slightly (if rewards are close to 1.0). Since current rewards are around 0.3, which is far from 1.0, I think we're still in the exploration phase.

From the top 5 best params, I notice that some states have actions that move towards the goal, but they might not always be leading directly. For example, state 0 (top-left corner) has a policy of action 2, which is up—this seems counterintuitive because it's already at the top. Maybe that's causing the agent to loop or go into holes.

I should consider policies where states closer to the goal have actions that push towards it. For instance, state 14 (which is the cell above the goal) should take action down (3) to reach state 15. Similarly, state 10 (third column of the third row) might benefit from moving right.

I also need to be cautious about the holes. The trajectories show that some policies lead into loops or fall into holes because they're not avoiding them properly. So each action should minimize the chance of stepping on a hole while maximizing the chance of reaching the goal.

Let me try to create a new params array that directs states towards the goal and avoids dangerous areas. For example, state 0 could go right (action 1) instead of up to move closer to the goal. Similarly, state 7 is the bottom-right cell of the second row; action right would take it to the goal.

I'll structure each state's action based on their position relative to the goal and ensure that they don't lead into holes. Maybe for certain states, taking a different direction would help avoid traps. For instance, in the third column (states 2,6,10,14), moving right should be encouraged as it leads towards the goal.

Putting this together, I'll assign actions to each state that moves towards the goal or cycles safely without entering holes. This might involve setting specific directions for edge cases and ensuring that states near the goal have direct paths.
