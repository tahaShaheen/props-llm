You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to get the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The problem is that the current policy parameters are all set to 1, which might not be the best approach because of the slippery environment and the possibility of falling into holes.

First, I understand that the state space is a 4x4 grid, so there are 16 states. Each action leads to one of three possible next actions with equal probability when certain policies are chosen. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right corner) and get +1 reward for each visit, but all other states give 0.

The challenge here is that the policy doesn't know about the holes in the map, so it should explore until it finds them. Since we're using a policy-based approach where the policy is parameterized by an array of actions, I need to optimize these parameters (params) such that the agent explores efficiently and avoids the holes.

I've heard that policy gradients are good for this kind of problem because they can learn from the immediate reward without needing to model the entire environment. However, with 16 parameters, it might be a bit tricky to tune them effectively.

Looking at the top-performing params provided, most of them have values around 0 or 3, which suggests that agents are often either acting on the left (0) or right (2), avoiding the holes. But I notice some variation, like 1 and 4, which might mean some exploration is needed.

I think the key here is to use a method like policy gradient with techniques like RMSprop or Adam optimizers. These methods adjust the parameters based on how well they're performing, gradually improving them until convergence. Since the environment is episodic (rewards are additive after each step), I should ensure that the learning rate doesn't get too large and that it's adaptive.

Another consideration is whether any state is a hole. If states 3 and some others are holes, the agent needs to avoid them by exploring paths around. The current policy might not be handling this well because all actions are treated equally, so if there's a hole adjacent in certain directions, the agent might get stuck or fall.

I should probably add some exploration techniques like ε-greedy (where with probability ε, the agent explores randomly) and maybe an ε that decreases over time. This way, the agent doesn't get too stuck on local maxima but still explores enough to find better paths.

Also, since all actions are initially symmetric in the parameter array, perhaps I can focus on each action's contribution separately. For example, adjusting params[0] affects left and down moves from the top-left state, while params[1] affects right, down, and left from the top-right, etc. Maybe I should optimize these parameters individually, but I'm not sure if that would help.

I also wonder about the discount factor. If it's too high, the agent might learn prematurely; if too low, they won't get rewards for future steps correctly. But since this is an episodic setup, maybe a fixed γ (like 0.9 or similar) is appropriate.

Another thought: perhaps using a value function approximation could help, but in this case, we're focusing on a policy gradient approach where the parameters directly control the policy. So it's better to stick with that for simplicity and effectiveness.

In summary, I think the optimal strategy involves optimizing each parameter using a policy gradient method, adjusting them based on performance, and incorporating some form of exploration (like ε-greedy) and perhaps state-specific adjustments if holes are present. I'll proceed by implementing an optimizer like Adam or RMSprop to tune these parameters effectively.
