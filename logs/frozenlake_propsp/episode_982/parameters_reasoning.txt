You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment to maximize the reward. The goal is to get to state 15 with the highest possible probability, and avoid the holes which end the episode immediately.

First, I need to understand the environment better. It's a 4x4 grid, so states are numbered from 0 to 15. The agent can move in four directions, but because it's slippery, each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability. That means there's some uncertainty in where the agent will end up after taking an action.

Looking at the provided trajectories and policies, I see that previous attempts have had low rewards (around 0.10 to 0.45). Since the optimal reward is supposed to be around 1.0, these are far below that. This means we're in the exploration phase where the goal is to gather more information rather than exploit what's working so far.

I should consider policies that explore different paths and avoid the holes as much as possible. For example, if a state has a high chance of leading to a hole when taking certain actions, the policy should choose actions that minimize this risk.

Looking at the most recent policies, they might not be effective because their rewards are low. So, I need to propose a new set of parameters that haven't been tried before and could potentially lead to better exploration or higher reward.

I'll start by thinking about key states:

- State 15 is the goal; any policy for this state doesn't matter as it's terminal.
- States near the goal (like 12, 13, 14) should move towards 15 if possible.
- Holes are presumably in certain positions. From the trajectories provided, some states might be leading to holes when specific actions are taken.

For example, state 0 is the top-left corner. If it takes action 0 (down), maybe it leads to a hole, so perhaps choosing other actions would be better.

I should ensure that from each state, the chosen action doesn't have a high probability of falling into a hole. For instance, if taking action X from state Y often leads to a hole, then the policy for Y should avoid X.

But without knowing the exact positions of the holes, I can only infer based on the trajectories provided. From the last attempt, some states might have high risks.

I'll try to design a policy where each state chooses an action that moves towards the goal as much as possible while avoiding risky actions. For example:

- States in the bottom row (12-15) should move right or up if possible.
- Middle rows should navigate towards the right and down to approach the goal.

I'll create a tentative policy where each state selects an action that generally moves towards the goal, considering the slippery nature of movement. For instance, from state 0, choosing action 2 (up) might not help since it's already at the top, so maybe action 3 (right or other directions). Wait, but up from 0 is invalid, so actually, action 2 would try to move up with some probability.

Wait, no—each action leads to three possible moves. For example, action 0 from state 0 would lead to down, left, or up. But since state 0 is at the top-left (row 0, column 0), moving up isn't possible—it might stay in the same state or wrap around? Or perhaps it's impossible, leading to another direction.

Actually, I think in FrozenLake, if you try to move beyond the grid, you stay in place. So from state 0, action 2 (up) would keep the agent in state 0 because moving up isn't possible.

Therefore, choosing actions that lead towards the goal without getting stuck or falling into holes is crucial.

Given this, I'll propose a policy where each state chooses an action that primarily moves right or down, as those directions lead closer to the goal. For example:

- State 0: action 3 (right, up, left) but wait—action 3's possible moves are left, up, right. From state 0, moving left isn't possible, so it would try to move up or right. Since right is towards the goal, this might be better.

Wait, no—the actions from each state have specific possible moves:

Looking back: Each action leads to three directions with equal probability. The description says:

- Action 0: down, left, up
- Action 1: right, down, left
- Action 2: up, right, down
- Action 3: left, up, right

So for each state, taking an action will lead to three possible moves.

For example, in state 0 (top-left), moving up isn't possible. So if the agent takes action 0 (down, left, up), it can only move down or left because up is invalid. Similarly, taking action 3 would try to go left, up, or right—left and up are invalid from state 0, so it could only go right.

Wait, no—if you're in state 0 and take action 0 (down, left, up), since up isn't possible, does the agent just choose between down and left? Or does it try all three but wraps around or stays?

I think in standard FrozenLake, moving beyond grid boundaries doesn't change the state. So from state 0, taking action up would stay in state 0.

But perhaps for this problem, when you try to move beyond the grid, you just don't move—so taking an invalid direction doesn't change the state. Therefore, from state 0:

- Action 0 (down, left, up): possible moves are down and left. Since up is invalid, it only has two options.
Wait no—if action 0 leads to three directions with equal probability, but moving in invalid directions keeps you in place. So for state 0, action 0 would lead to:

- Down: to state 4
- Left: stays at state 0 (since left from column 0 isn't possible)
- Up: stays at state 0.

So the agent has a 1/3 chance of moving down, and 2/3 of staying in place when taking action 0.

Similarly, action 3 from state 0 would try to go right, up, or left. Right is valid (state 1), up and left are invalid. So action 3 from state 0 gives:

- Right: state 1
- Up: stays at 0
- Left: stays at 0.

Thus, taking action 3 has a higher chance of moving towards the goal.

So for state 0, to maximize the chance of moving right (towards the goal), I should set params[0] = 3.

Similarly, for other states:

Looking at state 15 is the goal. So any policy that reaches here gets +1 reward. But once there, it's terminal.

State 14: to reach 15, should take right action if possible.

But wait, how do the actions translate? Let me think about each state and which actions could lead closer.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to create a deterministic policy that always moves towards the goal as much as possible. However, due to the slippery nature, it's probabilistic.

Another strategy is to have policies where each state chooses an action that maximizes the chance of moving right or down. For example:

- If in a state where moving right leads closer to 15, choose actions that include right.
- Similarly for down.

But considering all possible states and their transitions is complex without knowing the exact hole positions.

Given the low rewards so far, I think it's best to propose a policy that explores different paths. For example, set some states to take action 0 and others to take action 3, varying the choices to see which leads closer to the goal.

Looking at the most recent attempts, the last policy had params[0] =2; but the reward was low. So maybe trying a different approach for state 0.

I think I'll propose a policy where:

- States in the top row (0-3) try to move right or down.
- Middle rows try to move towards the goal, avoiding left moves that might lead into holes.

But without knowing which states are holes, it's hard. Alternatively, perhaps setting all states except those near the goal to take action 1 or 2, which have a mix of directions.

Alternatively, I could create a policy where each state takes action 0 and 3 with some variation. For example:

- Even-numbered states take action 0
- Odd-numbered states take action 3

But this is just a random approach without considering the environment's specifics.

Wait, perhaps another angle: since the optimal reward should be around 1.0, meaning that sometimes the agent reaches the goal but not always. Therefore, the policy should have a high probability of eventually reaching state 15 without falling into holes.

Given that, I might focus on setting policies for states near the goal to move right or down, and other states to explore different directions.

But since this is an exploration phase (since rewards are low), perhaps trying a completely new set of parameters that haven't been tried before.

Looking at the top 5 best params, they have certain patterns. For example, many take action 1 for state 0, but maybe trying something else.

So I'll propose a new set where:

- State 0: action 3 (to try moving right)
- State 1: action 2
- State 2: action 1
- Etc., varying the actions to explore different paths.

Alternatively, perhaps setting some states to take specific actions that haven't been tried before in previous policies. For example, if most policies have state 0 taking action 1 or 3, maybe try action 2 for state 0 and see how it goes.

But since I don't know the exact hole positions, it's a bit of a gamble. However, to maximize information gain, I need to propose something new that could potentially reveal more about which actions lead towards the goal or into holes.

After considering all this, I'll create a new set of params where each state takes an action different from the previous top policies. For example, if the previous best had params[0] as 1, now set it to 2. Similarly for other states, choosing different actions to explore new trajectories.

So here's a tentative policy:

- State 0: 2
- State 1: 0
- State 2: 3
- State 3: 1
- And so on, varying each state's action to something not commonly used before.

But without knowing the exact hole positions, this is challenging. Alternatively, perhaps setting all states except those near the goal to take a specific action that encourages exploration towards the right and down.

Given all these thoughts, I'll propose a policy where most states take actions that move towards the goal when possible, while varying some to avoid previously tried combinations.
