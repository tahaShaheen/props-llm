You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me start by understanding the problem better.

The environment is a 4x4 grid where each state corresponds to a specific cell. The agent can move in four directions: left, down, right, up. However, because the lake is slippery, taking an action doesn't guarantee moving in that direction; instead, there's a 1/3 chance of moving in three possible directions.

The goal is state 15 (bottom-right corner), which gives a reward of +1. All other states give 0, and some are holes that end the episode if stepped on.

The policy is an array of 16 numbers, each between 0-3, indicating the action for each state. The challenge is to find the optimal policy that maximizes the average reward over 20 episodes.

Looking at the provided data:

- The top-performing policies have rewards around 0.45, which is significantly below the target of 1.0. This suggests we need a better strategy.
- Trajectories show agents getting stuck in loops or falling into holes, indicating that current policies might not avoid dangers effectively.

As an optimizer, I should focus on tweaking the best-performing policies to see if minor changes can lead to higher rewards. Since the previous top policy has f(params) = 0.45, maybe adjusting some actions could help reach the goal more reliably.

Let me think about state transitions. For example, being in state 8 (top row is 0-3, so state 8 is third row first column). What's the best action from there? Maybe moving right or down to approach the goal without hitting a hole.

Looking at the previous policies, some states might be taking actions that lead towards holes. For instance, if a policy suggests moving left when in a state where that could fall into a hole, it's bad. So I should ensure each action from a state avoids known holes.

Also, considering the slippery nature, choosing actions that increase the chance of reaching the goal despite the randomness is key. Maybe prioritizing actions that generally move towards the right or down more often.

I might need to adjust certain states' actions. For example, in state 14 (which is row 3, third column), taking action 2 (up) could help reach state 15. Or maybe another action depending on the surrounding.

Another approach is to simulate a few steps with different policies. If I change the action for a particular state, would it lead the agent towards the goal or away from a hole?

Given that previous attempts are yielding lower rewards, perhaps the policies aren't effectively navigating towards the goal. Maybe some states are causing loops, so adjusting their actions could break those cycles.

I should also consider which states are more critical. For example, being in state 14 (row 3, column 2), moving up would take it to state 15 if successful. So action 0 (which has a 1/3 chance of down, left, or up) might be good because from state 14, moving up with some probability could reach the goal.

Alternatively, in state 14, taking action 2 (right) might also help, but I need to see which has a higher chance of success considering the slippery nature.

In summary, I'll adjust certain states' actions to either move towards the goal more directly or avoid holes. Focusing on states closer to the goal and ensuring their actions have a good chance of reaching state 15 despite the slipperiness.
