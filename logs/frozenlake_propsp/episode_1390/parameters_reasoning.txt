You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me break down what's given and figure out a good strategy.

First, the environment is a 4x4 grid where each state is numbered from 0 to 15. The goal is state 15, which gives +1 reward. All other states give 0, except when you fall into a hole, which ends the episode with no reward.

The policy is an array of 16 actions (each from 0-3) that maps each state to an action. The tricky part is the slippery nature: taking an action leads to three possible moves with equal probability. So, for example, choosing action 0 could result in moving down, left, or up.

Looking at the top 6 best-performing params, their average reward is around 0.45. That's significantly below the target of 1.0, so it suggests we're not yet optimal. The recent three policies had rewards 0.00, 0.30, and 0.00, which are quite low.

Given that I'm at iteration 1390 out of 5000, I should be in the exploration phase since the rewards aren't close to optimal yet. My goal is to maximize information gain by proposing a new set of params that haven't been tried before and can help identify better policies.

I notice that previous attempts have certain patterns. For instance, many of them might be choosing actions that lead towards state 15 but not efficiently or getting stuck in loops or holes.

To explore more effectively, I should design a policy that encourages moving towards the goal while avoiding known holes. Maybe focusing on right and down movements since the goal is at the bottom-right corner (state 15). But considering the slippery nature, sometimes moving left or up might be necessary to avoid holes.

I need to choose each params[i] from [0,1,2,3], making sure that for states closer to the goal, the actions are more directed towards right and down. Also, ensuring that in positions where falling into a hole is likely, the policy avoids those by choosing safer actions.

Let me think about specific states:

- State 0 (top-left corner): It's best to move right or down. Maybe action 1 (which includes right) would be better.
- State 3: If we're on top row, third column, moving down is good towards state 7.
- Middle states like 6,7 might need careful handling to avoid falling into holes.

Perhaps I should set the policy for each state to prefer actions that have a higher chance of moving closer to the goal without taking unnecessary risks. For example, action 2 includes right and up; maybe better in some positions than others.

Wait, let me list possible actions:

Action 0: down, left, up
Action 1: right, down, left
Action 2: up, right, down
Action 3: left, up, right

So, to move towards the goal (state 15), which is at the bottom-right, we need to prioritize right and down actions.

Looking at states:

- States in row 0 (0-3): Need to go down or right.
- States in row 3 (12-15): Maybe stay right or down as needed.

So for state 0: action 1 (right) is good. State 1: action 3 might give more right options, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, action 1 again could help move towards the right.

I think a possible strategy is to set each state's action to prefer moving right or down, depending on their position. For example:

- States in row 0 (0-3): action 1 (right) for 0, maybe 3 for others.
- States in row 1: action 2 (which allows up, but that might not help), perhaps better to choose action 1 or 3.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think differently. Maybe the optimal policy should be such that most states have actions that push towards right and down, avoiding left and up unless necessary.

But considering the slippery nature, sometimes moving in one direction could lead you elsewhere. So perhaps setting each state to choose actions that maximize the chance of moving towards the goal, even if it's probabilistic.

Alternatively, maybe a deterministic policy isn't possible due to the stochasticity, so we need to find the best distribution.

Wait, but since the environment is slippery and the agent has no control over where it goes exactly when taking an action, perhaps the optimal policy should be one that maximizes the probability of eventually reaching state 15 without falling into holes.

In that case, certain states might have specific actions that avoid known holes. For example, if a hole is in state 6, then from state 5, choosing an action that doesn't lead to 6 would be better.

But I don't know the exact locations of the holes. However, based on previous trajectories, maybe some positions are more risky.

Looking at the recent policies and their trajectories:

One trajectory was (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (1,1), which suggests that from state 4 (which is row 1, column 0), taking action 3 might lead to moving left or up or right. If action 3 leads to state 5 or back, but if there's a hole in state 5, then perhaps avoiding it.

Wait, I'm not sure about the exact positions of the holes, but maybe some patterns can be inferred from the trajectories.

Given that the rewards are still low, perhaps the current policies aren't effectively navigating towards the goal without falling into holes. So, to explore more, I should propose a policy where states have varied actions, possibly including a mix of right and down, with some left or up in strategic positions to avoid holes.

Let me try constructing such a policy:

- For state 0: action 1 (right)
- State 1: action 3 (right is an option)
- State 2: action 2 (up might not help, but right and down could)
- State 3: action 0 or 1
Wait, perhaps it's better to set each state's action based on the direction towards the goal.

Alternatively, maybe setting all states in the first three rows to move right when possible, and down otherwise. But I'm not sure how that translates into action choices.

Another approach is to consider that since moving up or left could lead away from the goal, perhaps minimize those actions unless necessary for avoiding holes.

Wait, but without knowing where the holes are, it's hard to set specific actions. So maybe instead, pick a policy that varies more across states, exploring different paths.

I think I need to come up with a new params array, making sure each state has an action from 0-3, not repeating any previous attempts.

Looking at the recent params:

The most recent ones were all trying various combinations. For example, one had params[0]=2, which is action 2 (up, right, down). Maybe that's a good start for some states.

Alternatively, perhaps set state 0 to action 1 (right), state 4 to action 0 (down), etc., but I need to be systematic.

Let me list each state and decide an action:

State 0: top-left. Action 1 (right) is good.
State 1: top-middle. Action 3 could allow right, which helps towards the goal.
State 2: top-right. Maybe action 0 or 1? If moving down is better, but in state 2, moving right would be out of bounds, so maybe down to state 6.
Wait, no, the grid is 4x4, so from state 3 (top row last), moving right would stay in state 3? Or perhaps it's a toroidal grid? No, probably wraps or falls.

Actually, in FrozenLake, I think movement beyond grid boundaries stays in place. So moving right from state 3 might keep you in state 3 or move to another cell if allowed.

Wait, no— FrozenLake usually doesn't wrap around. Moving right from state 3 (top row last) would stay in state 3. Similarly for other edges.

So, considering that, perhaps:

- For states on the top row: moving down is better towards the goal.
- For states on the leftmost column: moving right is better.

Therefore, setting action 1 for state 0 (right), action 0 for state 4 (down), etc.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe a more balanced approach is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps all states should have action 2 or 3 to encourage movement towards the goal, as these actions include right and down.

Wait, let's think about each action:

Action 0: [down, left, up]
Action 1: [right, down, left]
Action 2: [up, right, down]
Action 3: [left, up, right]

So, to move towards the goal (south-east), actions that include right and down are preferable.

Thus:

- For states in row 0, moving down is better.
- For states in column 0, moving right is better.

Therefore, for state 0 (row 0, col 0): action 1 includes right and down. Maybe action 1 or 3?

Wait, action 1 allows right, which would keep it in the same state if at top row, but maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, action 0 from state 0: down to state 4, left (stays?), up (stays?). Hmm, not ideal. Maybe better to choose action 1, which includes moving down or right.

But without knowing the grid dynamics exactly, it's challenging. So perhaps a safer approach is to set each state to an action that maximizes the chance of moving towards the goal.

Alternatively, let me pick a policy where most states have actions that include right and down, except when in positions where left or up might be necessary to avoid holes.

Since I don't know the hole locations, maybe it's better to have a mix. For example:

- States 0,4,8,12: set action 0 (down)
- States 1,5,9,13: set action 3 (right and up)
- States 2,6,10,14: set action 2 (right and down)
- States 3,7,11,15: set action 1 (right)

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps a more uniform distribution where each state has a varied action.

Wait, another approach is to make the policy such that from each state, the agent has at least one action towards the goal. For example:

- From states in row <3, prefer down actions.
- From states in column <3, prefer right actions.

So for each state i (0-15):

If i is in row 0: action 1 or 0 (right or down)
If i is in column 0: action 0 or 1 (down or right)

But without knowing the exact grid layout, it's a bit tricky. Alternatively, perhaps set all states to action 2, which allows up, right, down.

Wait, but that might not be optimal.

Alternatively, perhaps set each state to choose an action that has a higher chance of moving towards the goal. For example:

- States in row 0: action 1 (right or down)
- States in row 1: action 2 (up, right, down) – not sure
- Maybe it's better to have a mix.

I think I need to propose a new set of params that haven't been tried before. Looking at the previous top params, many had similar structures. So perhaps changing some key states could help.

Let me try setting:

- State 0: action 1 (right)
- States in row 0 (0,1,2,3): action 1 or 3 to encourage right movement
- States in column 0 (0,4,8,12): action 0 (down)
- For other states, choose actions that include both right and down.

Alternatively, perhaps a greedy approach where each state's action is chosen based on the direction towards the goal.

But without knowing all this for sure, I'll have to make an educated guess. Let me try setting:

params = [
    1,  # 0: right
    3,  # 1: right or up or left?
    2,  # 2: up, right, down
    0,  # 3: down, left, up
    0,  #4: down
    1,  #5: right, down, left
    2,  #6: up, right, down
    3,  #7: left, up, right
    3,  #8: left, up, right
    0,  #9: down, left, up
    1,  #10: right, down, left
    2,  #11: up, right, down
    3,  #12: left, up, right
    0,  #13: down, left, up
    1,  #14: right, down, left
    3   #15: left, up, right (but goal is here)
]

Wait, but state 15 should be the end. Maybe setting it to any action isn't necessary since it's the terminal state.

But in our case, once you reach 15, you get +1 and the episode ends. So perhaps for state 15, any action doesn't matter because the agent stops.

Hmm, but in the given problem, params[15] is part of the policy. However, in reality, reaching 15 ends the episode, so maybe it's better to set it to an action that ensures termination upon reaching. But since the environment likely ignores actions when in terminal states, perhaps it doesn't matter.

Alternatively, perhaps setting state 15's action to 0 or something else doesn't affect anything because the episode is over.

But given that I need to propose a valid params array, including state 15, I'll include an action for it. Let's say action 3.

So compiling all this, my proposed params would be:

params[0]:1, params[1]:3, params[2]:2, params[3]:0, params[4]:0, params[5]:1, params[6]:2, params[7]:3, params[8]:3, params[9]:0, params[10]:1, params[11]:2, params[12]:3, params[13]:0, params[14]:1, params[15]:3

I think this covers a good spread of actions towards the goal while exploring different paths to avoid holes.
