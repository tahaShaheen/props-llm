You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment using a given set of parameters. Let me try to break down how I should approach this.

First, I remember that in reinforcement learning, the goal is to find a policy that maximizes the expected cumulative reward. The policy is represented by a vector where each element corresponds to an action (0-3) and the state number. Each parameter in the vector is set to either 0, 1, 2, or 3.

The provided example has parameters like [2,0,3,2,1,...], which means for states 0-3, actions taken are 2, 0, 3, etc. My task is to adjust these values so that the policy leads the agent through all the white tiles (the map) without falling into the hole at state 15.

I should start by thinking about how each parameter affects the possible moves. Each action has certain probabilities when the environment is slippery. For example, taking action 0 from any state will lead to moving down, left, or up with equal chance. Similarly, other actions also have their own probabilities based on their choice.

Since the policy should explore all states without falling into the hole, I need to ensure that for each state (except the goal), the agent can move around and reach the goal through various paths. This means avoiding hard-coded paths where a single action leads directly to a hole or the goal.

I think about using Q-learning or SARSA as algorithms, but since we're given parameters that represent the policy, it's more about updating these actions based on the observed rewards. However, without specific details on how the agent interacts with the environment (like experience replay and discount factor), I might assume a basic policy evaluation approach.

I should consider what each parameter choice implies for the transitions. For example, action 0 is often taken when the agent wants to go down, so setting params[2] to higher values would encourage moving down more. But since all actions have their own probabilities, I need to balance this with other actions that might be necessary in different parts of the map.

Looking at the top-performing examples provided:

- One has a mixture of 0 and 1, suggesting it's exploring different directions.
- Another uses 3, which is right or down, so maybe exploration is encouraged here.
- Some states choose 2 (up) more often, perhaps avoiding immediate moves that could lead to the hole.

I need to ensure that for each state, all possible paths are explored and that the policy can find a way out. Maybe starting with higher values in parameters corresponding to safer actions will help avoid holes.

Since I don't have the actual interaction process beyond knowing the reward structure, I'll assume the goal is at 15 (state 15), and other states yield +1 except for the hole state which yields 0.

I should also consider that moving through a hole means the episode terminates, so the agent must avoid it. Therefore, in any state leading to the hole via an action, the policy needs to not choose that action unless it's absolutely necessary.

Given all this, I think setting parameters around 2 would encourage moving up and down, avoiding immediate hard moves towards the hole. This way, the agent can explore different paths and avoid being stuck on a single hole.

So, perhaps initializing params as [1,1,2,2,3,...] or similar where each parameter is set to 2 for most actions except those leading to holes.
