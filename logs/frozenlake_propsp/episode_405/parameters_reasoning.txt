You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, let's try to figure out the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. So, from what I understand, it's a 4x4 grid where each cell is a state numbered from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). The goal is to reach state 15, which gives a reward of +1, while all other states give 0. There are holes that end the episode if stepped on.

The environment is slippery, meaning each action has three possible outcomes with equal probability. For example, moving left might result in down, left, or up. So, it's not straightforward because actions don't lead directly to intended positions; instead, they have a 1/3 chance of going three different ways.

Given that the agent needs to avoid holes and reach the goal, I need to design a policy that maximizes the chances of reaching state 15 without falling into any holes. The policy is represented by an array of 16 elements, each corresponding to a state (0-15) and indicating which action to take.

Looking at the provided data:

- The top-performing policies have rewards around 0.30, which is still below the target of 1.0.
- Trajectories show that some policies are getting stuck or falling into loops without reaching the goal.

Since we're at iteration 405 out of 5000 and haven't reached the optimal reward yet, it's likely in the exploration phase. The goal is to maximize information gain by testing new policies that might lead us closer to the optimal solution.

I need to propose a policy that's distinct from previously seen ones to gather more data. Let's think about key states:

- State 15: Obviously, we want to stay here if reached.
- States near the goal (like 12, 13, 14) should have actions leading towards 15.
- Avoiding holes is crucial, so policies in states adjacent to holes should take cautious actions.

Perhaps setting up a policy that generally moves right and down when possible could help reach the goal. Also, considering the slippery nature, each action has three possibilities, so we need to account for all potential movements.

Let me draft a possible params array:

- For states 0 (top-left), moving right or down might be good starting points.
- States in the top row should move right towards state 3 and then proceed down.
- Middle states should navigate towards the goal while avoiding edges where holes are likely.

I need to ensure that each action choice doesn't lead into a hole. For example, if a state is adjacent to a hole, actions should avoid moving towards it unless certain.

After considering these factors, I'll propose a params array where most states choose right or down actions, but adjust based on proximity to the goal and potential holes.
