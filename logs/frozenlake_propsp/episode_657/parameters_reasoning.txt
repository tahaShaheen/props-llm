You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 657 out of 5000. OUTPUT ONLY THIS SINGLE LINE:

Do NOT output anything else. No explanation, no reasoning, nothing.



LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to help optimize the policy for the FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with a reward of +1 while avoiding holes that end the episode. The agent moves in four directions but due to slipperiness, each action leads to three possible next states with equal probability.

First, I need to understand the layout. The grid is 4x4, so states 0-3 are the top row, 4-7 the second, 8-11 the third, and 12-15 the bottom row. Holes aren't explicitly mentioned in the problem beyond being places that end the episode if stepped on.

Looking at the previous params and their rewards, all recent ones have f(params) around 0.3 or lower. Since we're far from the target reward of 1.0, I should act as an Explorer to maximize information gain by choosing a new set of params distinct from what's been tried before.

In the top-performing params, some states seem to be taking specific actions. For example, state 0 often takes action 1 or 2. Maybe there's a pattern in how these policies navigate towards state 15. However, without knowing the exact hole locations, it's challenging, but I can assume that certain states are risky.

I should focus on creating a policy where each state directs towards safe paths leading to state 15. Since moving right and down might be more direct towards the goal, perhaps setting params for each state to prefer actions that generally move toward the southeast direction (right or down) could help.

But considering the slipperiness, I need to ensure that even if the action is chosen, the possible next states don't lead into a hole. Since we can't know where holes are without prior information, the policy should aim for paths that statistically have higher chances of avoiding them.

Looking at previous attempts, some policies led trajectories towards state 15 in a few steps but got lower rewards due to perhaps taking longer or falling into traps. I should look for a balance between exploration and exploitation, even if we're acting as an explorer now.

I might consider setting actions that increase the chances of moving right or down from each state, with some variation to avoid getting stuck in loops. For example, in state 0 (top-left), choosing action 1 (right, down, left) could lead towards the right but also has a chance to move down, which might be safer.

I'll need to set each params[i] to one of [0,1,2,3], ensuring that from each state, there's a path that can reach state 15 without high risk. Maybe using a greedy approach where each action is chosen based on the direction towards the goal, considering possible slips.

After considering these factors, I'll propose a new set of params that differs significantly from previous ones to explore uncharted territory and gather more data on which paths are safe and effective.
