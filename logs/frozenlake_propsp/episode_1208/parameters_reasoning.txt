You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

Do NOT output anything else. No explanation, no reasoning, nothing.



LLM:
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment based on the information provided.

First, I need to understand the environment setup. It's a 4x4 grid where each state is numbered from 0 to 15. The goal is state 15, which gives +1 reward, while other states give 0. There are holes that end the episode if stepped on, but their positions aren't explicitly given. So I have to infer possible hole locations based on previous trajectories.

Looking at the provided top 5 best performing params and their trajectories, it seems like many policies are getting stuck or not reaching the goal quickly enough. The highest reward so far is 0.45, which is significantly below 1.0, suggesting that the optimal policy hasn't been found yet.

The recent parameters tried include various actions in each state, but none have achieved a high reward consistently. For example, one recent attempt (params starting with 3,2,3...) resulted in a trajectory that looped around without reaching the goal, yielding 0 reward. Another had a similar issue.

Given that the rewards are still low, I should focus on exploration rather than exploitation since we're not close to the optimal reward yet. So, I need to propose a new set of params that's different from previous ones and might explore paths that haven't been tried before.

Looking at state 0 (top-left corner), most policies choose action 1 or 2. Maybe trying action 3 could lead to a different path. Similarly, for other states, varying the actions might help avoid holes or find new routes to the goal.

I'll create a new set where each state chooses a different action than what's commonly seen. For example, in state 0, choosing action 2 (right) instead of 1 or 3 might be beneficial. I'll check for consistency across all states and ensure that the actions don't lead into obvious holes based on previous trajectories.

After considering these factors, here's a new set of params:
</think>

params[0]: 2, params[1]: 1, params[2]: 0, params[3]: 2, params[4]: 1, params[5]: 2, params[6]: 0, params[7]: 1, params[8]: 2, params[9]: 0, params[10]: 1, params[11]: 0, params[12]: 1, params[13]: 2, params[14]: 0, params[15]: 1
