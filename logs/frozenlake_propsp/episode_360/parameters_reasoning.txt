You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me try to understand what's going on here.

First, the environment is a 4x4 grid with states numbered from 0 to 15. The goal is state 15, which gives a reward of +1, and all other states give 0. But there are holes that end the episode if stepped on.

The policy is an array of 16 numbers, each indicating the action (0-3) for each state. Since the environment is slippery, when an action is taken, the agent moves in one of three directions with equal probability. So, from any given state, taking a specific action doesn't guarantee moving to a particular next state—it's probabilistic.

The user provided some previous attempts and their rewards. From what I can see, the best reward so far is 0.25, which isn't very high. The goal is to reach around 1.0, meaning we need policies that almost always lead to the goal without falling into holes.

Looking at the trajectories, it seems like some policies are getting stuck or not reaching the goal efficiently. For example, one trajectory went (0,1) -> (4,2) -> (8,2), which might not be leading towards 15 effectively. Another had a long loop and ended up in a hole.

To improve this, I need to propose a new set of params that either explore new paths or optimize existing ones. Since the current rewards are below 0.3, we're likely in an exploratory phase. So, I should suggest a policy that tries different actions in states where previous policies might have been stuck or falling into holes.

I'll consider changing some key states' actions to see if that helps reach the goal more effectively. For example, state 15 (the goal) probably doesn't need any action since it's terminal, but from the given params, it's set to 2. Maybe leaving it as is or trying a different action could help.

Looking at the recent policies, many have certain patterns, like setting state 0 to 1 or 3. I should vary these to see new outcomes. Perhaps changing state 0's action from 1 to something else might lead to a better path.

I'll also think about how each action affects movement. For instance, in slippery states, choosing actions that have a higher chance of moving towards the goal despite the randomness. Maybe prioritizing right and down actions more could help navigate towards state 15.

Finally, I need to ensure that the new params are different from all previous ones to maximize information gain. So, I'll shuffle some key states' actions while keeping others consistent with what might be working.
