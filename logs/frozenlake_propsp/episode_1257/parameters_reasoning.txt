You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get to state 15 with the highest reward possible. Since it's a 4x4 grid, there are 16 states in total. Each state has an action that the policy dictates.

From the problem description, I know that each action taken by the agent doesn't always result in moving in the intended direction because of the slippery nature of the environment. Instead, when the agent takes an action, it randomly selects from three possible directions with equal probability. For example, if the agent chooses to move right (action 1), there's a 33% chance each for right, down, or left.

The challenge is to design a policy that avoids falling into holes while trying to reach the goal state 15. The optimal reward should be around 1.0, meaning the agent reaches the goal consistently without falling into any holes.

Looking at the previous attempts and their trajectories, I can see that some policies are getting stuck in loops or not effectively navigating towards the goal. For instance, one trajectory went from (0,1) to (1,3), then back to (0,1), and so on, which indicates a loop without making progress.

I need to analyze each state's possible transitions due to the slippery nature and determine which actions would lead the agent closer to the goal while avoiding holes. For example, in state 0 (top-left corner), moving right or down might be better because that can take it towards the goal.

But wait, since the environment is slippery, choosing an action doesn't guarantee movement in that direction. So I need to select actions that have a higher probability of leading towards the goal despite the randomness.

I should map out each state's possible transitions based on each action and determine which action maximizes the chances of reaching the goal without hitting any holes. For states near the goal, setting the action directly towards it might be beneficial even though there's a chance to drift elsewhere. But for other states, perhaps a different approach is needed.

Looking at the previous top-performing policies, many have similar structures where they choose actions that cycle through certain directions. However, their rewards are still below 1.0, indicating room for improvement.

To avoid falling into holes, I need to ensure that from each state, the chosen action doesn't lead into a hole with any probability. So if taking an action could result in moving into a hole, the policy should choose a different action.

Given the current data, the best policies are getting around 0.45 average reward, which is significantly below the target of 1.0. This suggests that the agent isn't reaching the goal often enough and might be stuck in loops or falling into holes too frequently.

I think I need to adjust the policy for states near the top-left corner (states 0-3) and perhaps other areas where the agent is more likely to get stuck. Maybe setting actions that encourage moving towards the right or down, which are generally towards the goal, but being cautious of the slippery effect.

Also, considering the most recent policies, some have lower rewards due to getting stuck in certain states, so I should avoid those configurations and try different actions for problematic states.

After evaluating all this, I'll propose a new set of params where each state's action is chosen to maximize the chance of moving towards the goal without risking falling into holes. This might involve setting specific directions that have a higher probability of leading towards state 15 while avoiding any risky moves.
