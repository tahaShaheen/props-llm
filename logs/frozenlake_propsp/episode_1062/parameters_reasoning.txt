You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me start by understanding the problem. It's a 4x4 grid where each state is represented by numbers from 0 to 15. The goal is to reach state 15, which gives +1 reward, but there are holes that end the episode if stepped on.

The policy is an array of 16 actions (each being 0-3) for each state. Since the environment is slippery, each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability. So, moving left, right, up, or down from a given state isn't guaranteed—it's more probabilistic.

Looking at the interaction steps, I need to propose new params values based on the feedback given. The goal is to reach around 1.0 reward, which would mean reliably reaching the goal without falling into holes.

From the provided data, the top-performing params had f(params) around 0.35-0.45, which is far below 1.0. So, as an "Explorer," I should try different configurations to gather more information about what works and avoids holes.

I need to consider the trajectories given. For example, one trajectory went (0,1) (4,1), leading to a reward of 0.45. Another had a longer path but lower reward. So, perhaps some states are better not moving in certain directions due to hole risks.

To explore, I should change as many parameters as possible from previous attempts, especially for the states that have led to low rewards or holes. Maybe adjusting actions for states near the holes could help avoid them and find a path to the goal more efficiently.

I'll consider setting some states to move towards the right or down, depending on their position, to guide the agent towards state 15. For instance, in state 0 (top-left), moving right might be better, but given the slipperiness, it's probabilistic. Similarly, for state 7, perhaps moving down is better.

I should also check if any states are leading into holes when certain actions are taken. Maybe some actions from specific states have a high risk of falling into holes, so changing those actions could reduce failure rates.

Let me think about each state:

- State 0: Top-left. Possible to move right, down, or up (but up is out of bounds). But since it's slippery, action 0 might lead to down, left, or up. Maybe choosing action 1 here could help move right more often.
  
- State 1: Top-middle. Moving right (action 1) might take towards the goal.

Wait, but I need to ensure that each params[i] is a single action (0-3). Each choice determines which three directions are possible with equal probability.

So for state 0, if I set action 0, then from there, it can go down, left, or up. But since the agent starts at 0, moving left would keep it in the same state? Or does it wrap around? No, probably stays in 0. So that's a hole perhaps.

Alternatively, setting action 1 for state 0 might make it choose right, down, or left with equal probability. Moving right from 0 takes it to 1, which is better than staying.

Looking at the previous best params, many had action 1 for state 0. But maybe varying that could help explore further.

Another approach is to set a policy that moves towards the goal as much as possible while avoiding known holes. Since I don't know where the holes are exactly, but based on trajectories, some states might have higher risks.

Given that in the most recent params, setting certain actions led to low rewards or even 0, perhaps changing those could help.

I think a good strategy is to propose a new set of parameters that deviates significantly from previous attempts, especially for states that haven't performed well. For example, if state 14 (third row, third column) was previously set to action 2, maybe setting it to action 3 or another could change the outcome.

Wait, but without knowing the hole positions, I have to infer based on trajectories. If some paths led to holes quickly, perhaps those states' actions need to be adjusted to avoid moving into the direction of the holes.

Alternatively, maybe a more systematic approach would help. For instance, setting all even-numbered states to move right and odd-numbered states to move down or something like that. But I'm not sure how that would work with the slippery nature.

Another idea: Maybe the optimal policy is one that always moves towards the goal with as much certainty as possible, given the slipperiness. Since each action gives three options, perhaps choosing actions that maximize the chance of moving closer to 15.

For example:

- From state 0 (top-left), moving right or down would help approach the goal.
- From states in the top row, moving down is essential to reach lower rows.
- From states on the bottom row, maybe staying put isn't helpful; instead, move towards the end of the row.

But given that each action leads to three possible moves, I need to choose actions that give a higher probability of moving towards 15 without stepping into holes.

I think it's time to propose a new set of params. Let me try changing some key states:

- Set state 0 to action 3 (which allows right, up, or left). Wait, no—action 3 for state 0 would allow right, up, or left. But moving up from 0 is invalid, so it might stay in 0, which could be a hole.

Alternatively, set state 0 to action 1, which allows right, down, or left. So from 0, there's a chance to go right (to 1), down (to 4), or left (stay at 0). If 0 is a safe state, then moving right has higher potential.

Similarly, for other states:

- State 1: Maybe action 3 to allow up, right, or left. But I'm not sure.
- State 7 (top-right): Moving down would take it to 11, but maybe action 2 allows up, right, or down. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to set actions that generally move towards the goal:

For states in the top row (0-3), prefer moving down.
For states in columns 0 and 1, prefer moving right.
But I'm not certain how the slippery nature affects this.

Alternatively, for each state, choose an action that would ideally get closer to 15. For example:

- From state i, if moving right leads towards higher numbers (except for last column), then prefer actions that have a high chance of moving right or down.

But since each action gives three possible moves, maybe choosing the action that includes the desired direction as one of its options.

For instance:

- State 0: Choose action 1 (right, down, left). So from 0, there's a chance to go right to 1.
- State 1: Choose action 3 (up, right, left). From 1, moving right would take it to 2, but I'm not sure if that's better.

Wait, maybe I should structure this more methodically. Let me try to create a params array where each state is set to an action that includes moving towards the goal in at least one of its possible directions.

For example:

- State 0: action 1 (right, down, left) → right leads to 1.
- State 1: action 3 (up, right, left) → right leads to 2.
- State 2: action 3 (up, right, left) → right would be invalid, so maybe down.
Wait, state 2 is in the top row, third column. Moving right from 2 isn't possible; it's already at the end.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe a greedy approach where each action leads towards increasing the state number as much as possible would be better.

Alternatively, since the optimal reward is around 1.0, which suggests that the agent can reach the goal reliably once it finds the right path, I should focus on setting actions that guide towards 15 without getting stuck in loops or falling into holes.

Given that previous attempts had low rewards, perhaps adjusting certain states' actions to avoid risky moves would help. For example, if moving left from a state often leads to a hole, changing the action to not include left could prevent falls.

But without knowing which specific states are holes, it's challenging. However, based on trajectories provided, some paths quickly lead to termination, indicating that certain actions from those states may be risky.

In conclusion, I'll propose a new set of params where key states (like 0, 1, 7, etc.) have different actions than previous attempts, aiming to move towards the goal while avoiding potential holes. This should help gather more information about which paths are safe and effective.
