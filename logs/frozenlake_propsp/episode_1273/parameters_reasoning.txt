You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to optimize the policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get the agent to reach state 15 with as high a reward as possible, which should ideally be around 1.0.

First, let's understand the setup. It's a 4x4 grid where each cell is represented by a number from 0 to 15. The slippery nature of the environment means that when the agent takes an action, it doesn't always go in the intended direction—it has a 33% chance to move left, right, up, or down depending on which actions are available for each main action.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 numbers, where each number corresponds to the action taken from that state. The possible actions are 0, 1, 2, 3, each leading to different movement probabilities as described.

Looking at the history provided, it seems like the current best performing policies aren't getting very high rewards (the top f(params) is 0.45). This suggests that we're not yet near the optimal solution. So, I should focus on exploration rather than exploitation since the rewards are still far from 1.0.

In the recent trials, a lot of policies have resulted in trajectories where the agent either gets stuck or falls into holes without reaching state 15. For example, some trajectories end quickly because they fall into a hole, like (0,3) leading to a hole. Others loop around without making progress towards the goal.

To improve this, I need to propose a new set of parameters that haven't been tried before and can potentially lead the agent closer to state 15 while avoiding holes. Since previous policies might have led the agent into problematic states, I should consider actions that increase the likelihood of moving towards state 15 without stepping on holes.

One approach is to analyze the grid layout and determine safe paths from each state to the goal. For instance, starting from state 0 (top-left), taking action 3 (which has a higher chance to move right or up) might be beneficial. Similarly, states near the bottom-right should have actions that direct towards state 15.

Another consideration is ensuring that from any given state, the agent's policy doesn't lead it into known holes. For example, if certain actions from a state often result in falling into a hole, those actions should be avoided or minimized in probability.

Looking at the trajectories provided, I notice that some policies cause the agent to move left or down when they shouldn't, possibly leading them into holes or away from the goal. So, adjusting these states' actions to encourage movement towards the right and down (towards state 15) might be more effective.

I should also think about how each action affects the next possible states. For example, from state 0 (top-left), moving right is crucial because moving up or left would either stay in place or go into a hole. So, setting params[0] to an action that has a higher probability of moving right might be beneficial.

Similarly, for other starting states like state 1, taking actions that push the agent towards the right or down could help avoid holes and guide it closer to the goal.

Given all this, I need to construct a new set of params where each state's action is chosen to either move towards the goal or stay safe. For example:

- From states in the top row (0-3), encourage moving right or down.
- From states in the leftmost column (0,4,8,12), encourage moving right or down.
- Near the bottom-right corner, ensure actions lead directly to state 15.

I should also check if any of these changes have been tried before to avoid repetition. Since I can't remember previous attempts, I'll focus on making sure each param is a new combination that hasn't been seen yet in the provided history.

Finally, after considering all this, I'll propose a new set of params where each state's action is chosen to guide the agent towards the goal while minimizing the risk of falling into holes.
