You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right corner) and maximize the reward of +1, while avoiding the holes which end the episode immediately.

First, I need to understand how the slippery actions work. Each action taken by the agent has a 33% chance of moving in one of three directions. For example, choosing action 0 could lead to down, left, or up with equal probability. This makes the environment stochastic, so the same action might result in different moves.

Looking at the provided top 5 best-performing params, I notice that most of them have a reward around 0.35-0.45. The highest is 0.45, which suggests that the current policies aren't optimal yet because the global optimal should be around 1.0. So, there's room for improvement.

I also see the trajectories. For example, one trajectory goes from (0,1) to (4,2) and then to (8,2). That seems like moving down twice. But since the environment is slippery, maybe the agent isn't taking the most direct path. I need to find a way for the policy to navigate more effectively towards state 15.

The recent params show some variation, but none have reached the optimal reward yet. The most recent param had a reward of 0.25, which isn't great. So, I should try exploring different policies that might take better advantage of the grid's layout.

I think focusing on states near the goal (like state 14 and 15) is crucial. Maybe setting params[14] and params[15] to actions that have a higher chance of moving right or down, depending on their position. For example, if in state 14 (which is just above 15), choosing an action that tends to move down would help reach the goal.

Looking at the current best params, they often set params[7] to 2, which might be moving up from row 3 to row 2 or something. But perhaps adjusting this could lead to a more direct path.

I should also consider how each state transitions. For instance, if in state 0 (top-left), choosing an action that tends to move right or down would make sense. From the top row, moving right is towards the goal.

Since the environment is slippery, the policy needs to be robust against stochasticity. Maybe setting multiple paths to the goal by ensuring that from each state, there's a chance to move towards 15 without falling into holes.

I think I'll try modifying some of the parameters in states near the top-left and mid-section to encourage more rightward and downward movements. Also, making sure that once the agent is on row 3 (the bottom), it moves right as much as possible.

So, I'll adjust params for state 4 to move down (action 0 or 1) to get closer to the goal. Maybe setting params[8] (which is row 3, column 0) to action 2, which has a mix of up, right, and down, but since it's on the bottom row, moving right would be best.

I need to ensure that all changes are valid, meaning they choose from [0,1,2,3], and haven't been tried before. So I'll look for a configuration where key states have actions that push towards 15 without leading into holes.
