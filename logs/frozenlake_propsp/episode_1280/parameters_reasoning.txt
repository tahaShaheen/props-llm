You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. I'm trying to find the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment described here. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward by reaching state 15 without falling into any holes.

First, understanding the environment is crucial. It's a 4x4 grid with slippery movements, meaning each action leads to one of three possible directions randomly. The agent can move left, down, right, or up, but each action has a probability of 1/3 for three different directions. Holes are present, and stepping on them ends the episode.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 actions (params[0] to params[15]), each being 0-3 corresponding to left, down, right, up. The challenge is to find a policy that avoids holes and efficiently reaches the goal state (15).

Looking at the provided data, the best performing policies have an average reward around 0.45. My task is to propose a new set of params that either explores new areas if rewards are low or optimizes existing near-optimal solutions.

Since I'm at iteration 1280, and considering that the maximum is 5000, I need to decide whether to explore or exploit based on current reward levels. The rewards so far are below 1.0, which suggests we're in the exploration phase. Therefore, I should propose a new policy that hasn't been tried before, aiming to gather more information about unknown states and their outcomes.

Examining previous policies, many of them have params[0] set to 1 or 2. Let's try something different for state 0 (top-left corner). Maybe action 3 (up) could lead the agent somewhere new, but since it's already on the top row, moving up might not change the state. Alternatively, action 0 (left) would stay in place due to grid boundaries.

Alternatively, let me consider how each state transitions given the slippery nature. For example, if I set a certain action for state i, what are the possible next states? It's important to avoid actions that could lead into holes based on previous trajectories.

Looking at the top 5 params, they mostly have similar structures with some variations in later states. To maximize information gain, perhaps changing the initial states' actions would help discover new paths or identify new holes.

Let me try setting params[0] to 3 (up), but since it's already on the top row, moving up might not change anything. Alternatively, maybe setting a different action for state 1 (top-middle) could lead to better exploration.

Wait, perhaps I should look at which states are leading to holes in previous trajectories. For example, the trajectory with params[0]=2 had an early fall into a hole, so certain actions might be risky.

Alternatively, focusing on state 4 (second row, first column), if I set it to action 3 (up), but since it's already on the second row, moving up takes it back to state 0. Maybe that's not efficient.

I think I need a more systematic approach. Since all policies so far have low rewards, it's better to try new configurations in key states to see if they can lead to higher rewards.

Let me consider setting params[4] (state 4) to action 3 (up), which would send the agent back to state 0. That might not be helpful as it could loop. Instead, perhaps action 1 or 2 for state 4 could move towards the goal more effectively.

Wait, in state 4, possible actions are down, left, or up with equal probability. So if I set params[4] to 1 (right), then from state 4, it would have a chance to go right to state 5, which is part of the second row. That might be better.

Similarly, for state 0, setting action 2 (right) could help move towards the goal instead of moving down or left, which might lead into holes or loop back.

Let me try constructing such a policy:

- For states near the top-left, encourage rightward movement.
- For states in the second row, encourage downward or rightward to progress towards state 15.
- Ensure that actions don't lead into known holes based on previous trajectories.

But without knowing the exact hole locations, it's challenging. However, from the given trajectories, I can infer which states might be problematic. For example, if in state 4, moving left could be dangerous as seen in some trajectories where agents fell into holes.

So, perhaps setting params[4] to action 1 (right) would be safer and more goal-oriented.

Similarly, for state 5, set to move right or down to progress towards the goal.

I think I'll try a policy that generally encourages moving towards the goal by prioritizing right and down actions where possible, while avoiding left moves in certain states to prevent falling into holes.

Let me draft some specific changes:

- params[0]: action 2 (right)
- params[1]: action 3 (up) or 1 (right)
- params[4]: action 1 (right)
- params[5]: action 1 (right)
- And so on for other states, ensuring a path towards state 15.

But I need to make sure that each state's action doesn't lead into a hole. Since the environment is slippery and the exact holes aren't specified, it's tricky. However, by promoting right and down movements, especially from the top-left area, we can test if this leads to more successful goal-reaching.

Alternatively, perhaps setting params[0] to 1 (right) and see how that affects the trajectory. From state 0, moving right would take it to state 1 with some probability, but due to slipperiness, there's a chance to move down or up instead.

Wait, given the slippery nature, the agent's movement is probabilistic. So even if we set an action, the actual next state depends on the three possible directions.

Therefore, for each state, choosing an action that maximizes the probability of moving towards the goal while minimizing the risk of falling into holes is key.

Given that, perhaps setting actions that generally push the agent down and to the right would be beneficial. For example:

- Top row (0-3): encourage moving down or right.
- Middle rows: move down or right where possible.

But I also need to consider boundaries to avoid going out of the grid, which would likely end in a hole or stay in place.

This is getting complex. Maybe looking at the most recent policies can help. The last few had different actions but low rewards. Perhaps mixing actions could lead to better exploration.

I think I'll try setting some key states to action 3 (up) to see if that helps avoid certain holes, especially in the middle rows where moving up might take them back to previous rows without falling into traps.

Alternatively, focusing on state 12 and 13: since these are near the bottom row, actions should aim to move right towards state 15. So setting params[12] to action 0 (down) or 2 (right). Similarly for state 13.

I think I'll go with a policy that sets certain states to different actions to test new trajectories without repeating previous ones.
