You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get the agent from the start (state 0) to state 15 with the highest possible reward of +1. But there are holes that can end the episode if stepped on, so avoiding them is crucial.

Looking at the provided trajectories and policies, I see that most policies aren't performing well yet, as the rewards are around 0.2 to 0.25. That's way below the target of 1.0, which suggests that we're not getting close to the goal often enough. Maybe the current policies are either leading into holes or not effectively navigating towards state 15.

I notice that in some recent trials, actions led the agent to states like (0,3) repeatedly, which might be a hole, or stuck moving up and down without progress. So perhaps the policies aren't guiding the agent efficiently towards the goal.

To improve this, I should consider creating a policy that pushes the agent more towards state 15, possibly by encouraging right and down movements from certain states. But because of the slippery nature, each action can result in moving left, right, up, or down with equal probability for each direction except one which is avoided.

Wait, no—the problem says when an action is taken, it chooses among three directions with equal probability. So each action has a 1/3 chance to go in two other directions and a 1/3 chance to move as intended? Or wait, actually, the description says that taking action 0 results in moving down, left, or up with equal probability. Similarly for other actions.

So if I set a particular action for each state, it's not just about choosing one direction but influencing the probabilities towards the desired path. For example, to move right more often from a certain state, I need to pick an action that includes right as one of the possible moves.

Looking at the current policies, some are setting all actions to 0 or 1 or 2, which might not be effectively guiding the agent towards the goal. Perhaps varying the actions based on the position would help.

For instance, in state 0 (top-left corner), moving right is necessary to move towards the goal. So action 1 could be chosen because it allows movement right with probability 1/3, but also down and left. Alternatively, maybe another action might have a better chance of avoiding holes.

I should think about how each state can lead closer to the goal without falling into a hole. Maybe mapping out which states are safe and which aren't would help. From the trajectories provided, stepping on (0,3) or other edges might be leading to holes.

So perhaps in state 0, choosing action 1 (which allows right, down, left with equal chance) could help move towards either right or down, both of which are safer paths. Similarly, for states near the goal, ensuring that actions push towards moving right or down as needed.

I also need to ensure that from each state, the chosen action doesn't have a high probability of leading into a hole. For example, if a state is adjacent to a hole, choosing an action that avoids moving left (if that leads into a hole) might be better.

Given all this, maybe I should propose a policy where states closer to the goal have actions that push towards right or down, while avoiding movements that could lead into holes. This might involve setting specific actions for each state based on their position relative to the goal and the locations of the holes.

After considering these factors, I'll outline the params array with actions chosen to guide the agent towards the goal while minimizing the risk of falling into holes.
