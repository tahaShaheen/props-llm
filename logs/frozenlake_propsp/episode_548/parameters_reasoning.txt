You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me first understand the problem.

The environment is a 4x4 grid where each state is represented by numbers from 0 to 15. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) and get a reward of +1. Other states give 0, except for holes which end the episode with 0 reward.

The policy is an array of 16 actions (each can be 0-3), determining what action to take in each state. The challenge is to find the best set of these actions that maximizes the average episodic reward over 20 episodes.

From the user's message, I see that they've provided some examples of previous params and their rewards. The top-performing ones have an average around 0.30, which is below the target of 1.0. This suggests we're not yet at the optimal solution.

Looking at the trajectories, it seems like many policies are either getting stuck in loops or falling into holes. For example, some trajectories show repeated states, indicating cycles that prevent reaching the goal.

As an RL policy optimizer with no memory, I need to choose params that explore new possibilities without repeating past attempts. Since the rewards are still below 1.0, I should act as an Explorer and propose a new set of params distinct from previous ones.

I'll think about the structure of the grid and how actions might lead towards state 15 while avoiding holes. The slippery nature means each action has a 33% chance to go in any of three directions, so the policy needs to account for that uncertainty.

To maximize information gain, I want to test policies that have a good balance between exploration and exploitation. Maybe setting actions that generally move towards the right or down, since those are the directions toward state 15, while avoiding states known to be holes based on previous trajectories.

Looking at some of the previous params, many seem to cycle or not make progress effectively. I should pick a param set where each state is directed in a way that's likely to reach the goal without leading into common pitfalls.

Perhaps setting most states to move right or down, depending on their position, could help. For example, states near the top might prefer moving down, and those on the left might prefer moving right. This would create a general path towards the goal.

I should also ensure that each action in the params is unique from previous attempts, so I don't repeat any of the same policies provided in the examples. That way, I can gather new information about different paths and potential holes.

After considering all this, I'll propose a new set of params where most states are directed towards right or down movements, ensuring diversity from past trials to maximize exploration.
