You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the next set of parameters for the FrozenLake environment to optimize the policy and get closer to the global optimal reward of around 1.0. Let's start by understanding the problem.

The environment is a 4x4 grid with states numbered from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). The goal is state 15, which gives +1 reward. Other states give 0. The agent can move in four directions, but due to the slippery nature, each action leads to three possible next states with equal probability.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 actions (each from [0,1,2,3]). My task is to propose a new set of params that haven't been tried before and could potentially improve the reward. The recent trajectories show that most policies are yielding low rewards around 0.2-0.3, so I'm in the exploration phase.

Looking at the top-performing policies, they tend to have certain patterns. For example, some move towards the right or down more often to reach state 15. But since the environment is slippery, it's crucial that each action has a good chance of moving closer to the goal without falling into holes.

I should consider which states are near the goal and ensure their actions guide towards state 15. Also, I need to avoid actions that might lead into holes. From previous trajectories, some policies get stuck or fall into traps because they chose certain actions in vulnerable states.

Maybe I can adjust a few key parameters where the agent is close to the goal. For example, in state 14 (which is one step left of 15), the action should be right (action 2 or 3) to reach 15. Similarly, in state 10 (top row, third column), moving down or right would help.

I also notice that some policies cycle without making progress. To prevent this, actions should generally push towards the goal without creating loops. Perhaps setting more states to move right or down when possible.

Let me think of a configuration where each state's action is chosen to maximize the chance of reaching 15. For instance:

- States near the top-right (like 3, 7, 11) should move right or down.
- Middle states might benefit from moving towards the goal in one direction, maybe right or down based on their position.

I'll create a new params array where each state's action is set to move closer to 15. Let me sketch this out:

params[0]: down (action 0), but considering it's top-left and slippery, maybe right?
Wait, in state 0, if the agent takes action 0 (down), it can go to state 4 or others. Maybe setting action 1 for state 0 would move towards the right.

But I'm not sure; perhaps a better approach is to have each state choose an action that primarily moves it towards increasing row and column indices.

Alternatively, using a greedy approach where each state's action leads directly to the goal if possible, but considering the slippery nature. For example:

- State 14: action 2 (right) or 3 (up?), wait no—state 14 is in row 3, column 0. Moving right from 14 would go to 15.

Wait, state numbering might be tricky. Let me map the grid correctly.

The states are arranged as rows:

Row 0: 0,1,2,3

Row 1:4,5,6,7

Row 2:8,9,10,11

Row 3:12,13,14,15

So, state 0 is (row 0, column 0). Action down from 0 would go to 4, action right goes to 1.

But due to the slippery nature, choosing an action might not lead directly but could help in the overall direction.

Perhaps for states that are on the top row, we want them to move down or right. For middle states, moving towards the goal in either direction.

I think I'll create a new params where each state's action is set to 3 (which cycles through right, down, left with equal chance) except for certain key positions. Wait, no—that might not be effective.

Alternatively, for each state, select an action that has a higher probability of moving towards the goal. For example:

- States in row 0: prefer moving down or right.
- States in column 3 (last column): move down if possible.
- Avoid actions that could lead to holes.

But without knowing where the holes are exactly, it's tricky. Maybe it's better to have a conservative approach where each state moves towards the goal with higher probability.

Perhaps setting most states to action 2 or 3. Let me try:

params[0]:1 (action 1 leads to right/down/left)
Wait, that might not be optimal. Alternatively, set params[0] to 2 (right is one of its options). Hmm.

I'm a bit confused, but I need to propose a new set without repeating previous ones. Let me choose a few states to change their actions and see.

For example:

- Set state 14's action to 3 (which could move right, up, or down. Since moving right from 14 leads to 15, that's good.)

Wait, no—if the agent is in state 14, taking action 3 would choose between left, up, right with equal probability. So choosing right has a 1/3 chance to get to 15.

Alternatively, set action 2 for state 14: which includes right, down, or up. That way, moving right is possible.

Similarly, for other states near the goal:

- State 13: if I set action 0 (down), it can go to 17? Wait no—state numbering only goes up to 15. So state 13's down would wrap around or stay?

Wait, in a 4x4 grid, row indices are 0 to 3 and column indices 0 to 3.

From state s=12 (row 3, col 0), moving right goes to 13, which is (3,1). From 13, right is 14, then from 14, right is 15. So maybe setting states along the bottom row (12,13,14) to move right.

But considering the slippery nature, each action leads to three possible moves. For example:

- If in state 14, take action 2 (right, down, up). Moving right would get to 15, which is good.

So perhaps setting state 14's action to 2 or 3.

Alternatively, let me try creating a params where states closer to the goal have actions that push towards it.

I think I need to propose a new set. Let's say:

params[0]:1 (action 1: right/down/left)
params[1]:3
params[2]:2
params[3]:0
... and so on, but ensuring no duplicates from previous attempts.
