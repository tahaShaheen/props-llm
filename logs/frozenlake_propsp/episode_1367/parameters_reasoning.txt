You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward by reaching state 15 (the bottom-right corner). The environment is slippery, meaning each action leads to one of three possible directions with equal probability.

First, I need to understand the setup. The grid is 4x4, so there are 16 states numbered from 0 to 15. Each number corresponds to a specific cell: top row is 0-3, next is 4-7, then 8-11, and bottom is 12-15.

The agent can move in four directions, but due to slipperiness, each action (0-3) leads to three possible moves with equal chance. For example, action 0 (left?) leads to down, left, or up with 1/3 probability each. Wait, I need to clarify the mapping of actions to directions.

Wait, according to the description:
- Action 0: [down, left, up]
- Action 1: [right, down, left]
- Action 2: [up, right, down]
- Action 3: [left, up, right]

So each action corresponds to three possible moves. For example, taking action 0 from state 0 (top-left) could lead to moving down to 4, left which is impossible (stays or wraps?), or up which is also impossible. Hmm, but in grid terms, moving up from row 0 would probably stay on the same cell or maybe wrap around? Or perhaps the agent can't move beyond the grid's boundaries.

Wait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe when trying to move left from state 0, it stays in place, which could be considered as a hole or just not moving. But the problem states that holes end the game if stepped on, so I need to know where these holes are.

But wait, the user hasn't specified which states are holes yet. So perhaps in previous interactions, they were discovered through trajectories.

Looking at the provided data, there's a history of policies and their rewards. The top 7 best have f(params) around 0.45, and the recent ones have lower rewards or even zero. My job is to suggest the next params configuration based on this information.

Since I'm supposed to act as an RL optimizer, but with no memory between interactions, each suggestion must be unique and not repeat previous params. The goal is to maximize information gain, so if the current best reward is below 1.0, I should explore; if close to 1.0, I should optimize.

The user mentioned that the global optimal reward should be around 1.0, which suggests that it's possible for some policies to achieve this. However, none of the provided top params have reached that yet.

Looking at the most recent 5 params, they all have low rewards (around 0.05 or less). This indicates that the current exploration hasn't found a good policy yet. So I should switch to an explorer strategy—suggesting new and distinct parameter configurations to gather more information about which areas of the state space are safe and lead towards the goal.

I need to consider which states are holes and which are not, but since I don't have explicit knowledge, I'll infer from the trajectories. For example, if a trajectory ends quickly without reaching 15, it might mean that certain actions led into a hole or got stuck in a loop.

To avoid stepping into holes, the policy should guide the agent towards safe paths leading to state 15. Maybe focusing on moving right and down more often would help, considering the goal is at the bottom-right.

But since each action leads to three possible moves, the policy needs to choose actions that maximize the chance of reaching the goal without falling into a hole.

One approach is to set all states to prefer actions that generally move towards the goal. For example, in the top-left (state 0), choosing an action that tends to move down or right. But given the slipperiness, I need to choose actions whose possible moves have higher probability of leading closer to state 15.

Alternatively, perhaps using a greedy approach where each state's policy directs towards the next step that is more likely to reach the goal, considering the probabilities.

But without knowing which states are holes, it's tricky. Maybe focusing on states near the goal first and ensuring their policies lead directly to 15 or avoid dangerous moves.

Looking at the most recent params, many have low rewards, so I need to try different configurations that haven't been tried before. For example, perhaps changing more states to action 2 or 3, which include right and up/down movements, could help in navigating towards the goal.

I should generate a new set of parameters where each state is assigned an action from 0-3, ensuring no duplicates with previous policies. I'll need to pick actions that are different but have a logical path towards the goal.

Maybe starting by setting states closer to the goal (like 12,13,14,15) to move right or down if possible, and other states to move towards those directions.

But since it's slippery, I'll have to choose actions that when followed probabilistically, increase the chance of reaching the goal without falling into holes. For example, state 0 could be set to action 1 (which has a right move), hoping that from there, the agent can drift towards the right or down.

I think it's best to create a new policy where each state chooses an action that generally moves in a direction toward the goal, considering the possible moves. For example:

- States in the top row: prefer actions that move down.
- Middle rows: prefer moving right and down.
- Rightmost column: try moving down or right.

But I need to map this into specific action choices for each state, ensuring they are unique from previous policies.

After considering all this, I'll draft a new set of params where each state is assigned an action that should help navigate towards the goal without repeating any previous configuration. For example, changing some states from their previous actions to others in a way that explores new paths.
