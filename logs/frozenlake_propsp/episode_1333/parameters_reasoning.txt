You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to help find the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. So, let me break down what's given.

First, the environment is a 4x4 grid where the agent moves around with some slippery actions. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) for a reward of +1. Holes are present which end the episode if stepped on. The policy is a function that maps each state (0-15) to an action (0-3), and I need to find the params array that maximizes the episodic reward.

Looking at the history provided, there are several top-performing policies with rewards around 0.45. However, the global optimal should be around 1.0, so these aren't great yet. The recent attempts show lower rewards, suggesting we might need to explore more.

The key points from the problem:

- **Stateless Strategy**: I can't remember previous attempts, so each suggestion must be based solely on the information given.
- **Maximize Information Gain**: Each proposal should aim to provide new data that helps narrow down the optimal policy.
- **Explore vs Exploit**: Since current rewards are below 1.0, we're in "Explorer" mode, meaning I should suggest configurations different from previous ones to gather more info.

Looking at the trajectories, some states lead to quick successes or failures. For example, state 8 is a hole because stepping on it ends the episode. So, policies that avoid sending the agent to state 8 are better. Also, reaching state 15 yields +1.

In the recent params provided, many have high rewards around 0.45 but still below optimal. The latest few attempts have lower rewards (like 0.2 and 0.0), which means they might be hitting holes or getting stuck.

To maximize information gain, I should suggest a policy that explores new paths. Maybe change some actions to move towards the goal more directly while avoiding known holes.

Let me think about each state's optimal action:

- State 15 is the goal, so it's irrelevant.
- The surrounding states (like 14, 10, etc.) should have actions leading to 15 without hitting a hole.

Looking at state transitions and considering the slippery nature, I might set certain actions for each state that increase the chance of reaching 15 while avoiding holes. For example, moving right from state 7 or down from state 11 could be risky due to holes, so maybe choosing safer paths.

Since I'm in "Explorer" mode, I'll propose a new params configuration that differs significantly from previous ones, perhaps trying different action sequences towards the goal and away from holes.

After considering all this, here's the proposed params array:
</think>

params[0]: 1, params[1]: 2, params[2]: 1, params[3]: 0, params[4]: 2, params[5]: 3, params[6]: 3, params[7]: 2, params[8]: 0, params[9]: 3, params[10]: 2, params[11]: 1, params[12]: 0, params[13]: 2, params[14]: 3, params[15]: 3
