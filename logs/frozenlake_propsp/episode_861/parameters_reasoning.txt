You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. It's a 4x4 grid where the agent can move in four directions, but because it's slippery, each action leads to three possible next states with equal probability. The goal is to reach state 15 (bottom-right corner) for a reward of +1, while avoiding holes which end the episode.

Looking at the problem statement, I need to propose a policy that maximizes the average episodic reward over 20 episodes. The policy is defined by an array of 16 actions, each corresponding to states 0 through 15. Each value in this array can be 0,1,2, or3.

The user provided some previous attempts and their rewards. From these, I see that the highest reward so far is around 0.45, which is significantly below the target of 1.0. This suggests we're still in an exploratory phase since the rewards aren't close to optimal yet.

Since the user mentioned a stateless strategy where each iteration can't remember previous attempts, I need to focus on maximizing information gain. If the rewards are far from 1.0, I should be acting as an "explorer," trying out different configurations rather than tweaking existing ones.

Looking at the top 5 best-performing params, they all have similar structures but slightly varying actions. For example, in state 0, some choose action 1 or 2. The trajectories show that starting with certain actions leads to either falling into holes or not reaching the goal efficiently.

One key observation is that states near the bottom-right (like 12,13,14,15) are crucial for reaching the goal. If the policy in these states doesn't lead towards 15, it won't get the reward. Also, avoiding holes requires careful action selection in certain states.

I notice that state 0 often starts by moving right or down. Maybe trying a different initial move could help. Alternatively, perhaps adjusting the actions for states near the edges to push more towards the goal might improve performance.

Since all previous params seem similar, I should try a completely new configuration that hasn't been tried before. For example, making state 0 always go right (action 1) or down (action 0), and see if other states follow a path towards 15 without hitting holes.

I also need to ensure that the policy doesn't get stuck in loops. States like 1 might have actions that cause revisiting the same spots, leading to lower rewards. So adjusting their actions to move more directly towards the goal could help.

In summary, I'll propose a new set of params where each state directs towards the right or down as much as possible without immediately stepping into a hole. This should test if moving closer to the goal is feasible.
