You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy parameters for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to maximize the reward by reaching state 15 without falling into any holes. From what's given, the optimal reward should be around 1.0, which means the agent should successfully reach the goal in most cases.

Looking at the top 5 performing params, they all have f(params) around 0.35 to 0.45. That suggests that while these policies are better than random (which would likely give lower rewards), there's still room for improvement. The recent policies have even worse rewards, like 0.05 and below, which indicates that maybe the current strategies aren't effective enough.

Since I'm supposed to act as a stateless optimizer, I need to maximize information gain each time. Given that the rewards are below 1, I should focus on exploring new configurations rather than tweaking existing ones. But wait, the note says if rewards are far from 1, I should be an explorer. However, 0.45 is not too far, but maybe it's still worth pushing for better.

Looking at the trajectories, many of them end quickly either by reaching the goal or falling into a hole. For example, some trajectories loop around without making progress, which might mean that the policies are getting stuck in certain states. To fix this, I should consider changing actions in key positions to help the agent move towards the goal more effectively.

Let me think about state 0 (top-left corner). The current params for state 0 are mostly action 1 or 2. Let's see: action 0 from state 0 leads to [down, left, up]. Down would take it to state 4, left keeps it in state 0, and up is invalid because it's at the top. So, if I choose action 1 for state 0, which gives right, down, or left. Right takes it to state 1, down to 4, left stays in 0.

Wait, but since the environment is slippery, each action has a probability of moving in three directions. So choosing an action that generally moves towards the goal might be better. For example, from state 0, moving right (action 1) gives a chance to go towards the goal.

Looking at other states: maybe I should ensure that near the bottom-right, the agent is more likely to move right or down, but considering the slippery nature, it's tricky. Perhaps adjusting actions in states closer to the goal to prioritize moving towards state 15.

But since I'm supposed to output a new set of params each time and not remember previous attempts, I need to make sure that this new set is distinct from what's already been tried. Let me check the recent params: they've used various actions but haven't reached high rewards yet.

I think changing some key states might help. For example, in state 14 (which is just above state 15), choosing an action that would lead to moving right or down could be beneficial. Similarly, ensuring that states near the goal push towards it more directly.

Wait, but since the environment is slippery, each action has a chance of going three ways. So maybe setting actions in such a way that on average, they move towards the goal. For example, from state 12 (which is the bottom-left), moving right or up might help, but given the slipperiness, it's not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps focusing on avoiding holes is more critical. If I can create a policy where the agent avoids known holes, that would increase the chances of reaching the goal.

Looking at the trajectories provided, some end quickly because they fall into holes. So maybe adjusting the actions in states adjacent to holes to avoid them.

But without knowing exactly where the holes are (since it's not specified), I have to infer based on the trajectories. For example, state 6 might be a hole since one trajectory ends at (6,0). Similarly, other states like 5, 14 could be near holes.

So, to avoid falling into these, perhaps changing actions in those states to move away from dangerous areas or towards safer paths.

Given all that, I'll try to create a new set of params where key states are adjusted. Let's say for state 0, choose action 1 (right), which could help move towards the goal. For state 4 (top-left of second row), maybe action 0 (down) to go further down. Similarly, in state 8, perhaps action 3 (left, up, right) but need to see.

Wait, no: the actions have different effects based on their number. Let me double-check:

- Action 0 from any state leads to [down, left, up]
- Action 1 leads to [right, down, left]
- Action 2 leads to [up, right, down]
- Action 3 leads to [left, up, right]

So for each state, choosing the action that gives the best chance of moving towards the goal without falling into holes.

Let me think about each state:

State 0 (0,0): To move right is better. So action 1: from here, possible moves are right (state 1), down (4), or left (stay). Since it's slippery, this gives a chance to go towards the goal.

State 1 (0,1): Maybe action 3, which allows moving left, up, or right. But since we're on the top row, up is invalid, so possible moves are left to state 0, down to 5, or right to 2. Action 3 could help explore more.

Wait, but this might lead the agent to loop between states. Alternatively, maybe action 1 again for consistency.

But I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to vary some actions to break loops.

Given that previous policies have similar structures and haven't achieved high rewards, perhaps introducing more variation in certain key states could help.

Alternatively, since all top params seem to use a combination of actions 1 and 3, maybe trying a different approach by using other actions in specific states could lead to better exploration.

But considering the time constraints, I'll proceed with creating a new set where some critical states have their actions changed. For example:

- State 0: action 2
- State 1: action 3
- State 2: action 1
- ... and so on for other states, making sure each choice is different from previous attempts in at least one state.

This way, the new policy explores a different path and could potentially reach the goal more efficiently or avoid holes.
