You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get the agent from the starting position (state 0) to state 15 with the highest possible reward of +1. But there are holes in the grid that will end the episode if stepped on. The environment is slippery, meaning each action leads to one of three directions with equal probability.

First, I need to understand the structure of the grid. It's a 4x4 grid where state 0 is (0,0), and state 15 is (3,3). Each row represents a different y-coordinate, and columns are x-coordinates. So rows are top to bottom: 0-3, 4-7, 8-11, 12-15.

The slippery nature means that each action has three possible outcomes. For example, taking action 0 (left) could lead the agent down, left, or up with equal chance. This makes planning tricky because there's uncertainty in movement.

Looking at the top-performing params provided, they have f(params) around 0.30 to 0.25, which is relatively low. The optimal reward should be close to 1.0, so these aren't great yet. I need to find a policy that gets the agent reliably to state 15 without falling into holes.

The recent params tried all resulted in f(params) of 0.00, which suggests they either fell into holes or got stuck in loops without reaching the goal. So I need to propose a new set of params that can improve this situation.

Since the environment is stateless and I have no memory, each suggestion must be based solely on maximizing information gain for the next iteration. If rewards are low (which they are), I should act as an explorer, suggesting distinct configurations from previous attempts.

One approach is to design a policy that moves towards the goal while avoiding holes. For example, in state 0 (top-left corner), moving right or down might be better, considering the slippery nature. But since each action can lead to three possible directions, I need to choose actions that maximize the chances of reaching the goal.

Let me consider the structure:

- States near the bottom-right (like 12,13,14,15) are crucial for reaching the goal.
- Holes could be anywhere, but without knowing their exact locations, the policy should avoid risky moves.

I think setting up a policy that generally heads towards the right or down might help navigate towards state 15. For example, in earlier states (0-3), choosing actions that tend to move right or down would push the agent closer to the goal.

Looking at previous params, some had a mix of actions but didn't perform well. So maybe I should try a more consistent strategy, like always moving right when possible and down otherwise.

Another thought is to design the policy so that in each state, the action chosen has a higher probability of leading towards the goal. For example, in state 0, choosing an action that can move right or down would be better than left or up since those could take it away from the goal.

Let me try constructing such a policy:

- For states on the top row (0-3), prefer moving right and down.
- For states on the first column (0,4,8,12), prefer moving down to move towards the bottom.
- For other states, choose actions that can lead closer to state 15.

Wait, but each action has three possible outcomes. So I need to select an action such that at least one of its possible moves is directly towards the goal, increasing the chance of reaching it.

For example:

- In state 0 (top-left), if I choose action 1 (which can move right, down, or left), but moving right would take it closer. Alternatively, action 2 might have a better chance to go down.

Alternatively, maybe choosing actions that have a higher chance of moving towards the goal in at least one direction is better.

I should also consider avoiding holes. If certain states are known to be near holes, the policy should avoid actions that could lead there. But without knowing where the holes are, this is tricky.

Given the uncertainty, perhaps a greedy approach with some exploration would work best. But since each iteration only provides average reward over 20 episodes, I need to make sure each suggestion gives as much information as possible about what works and what doesn't.

Let me try proposing a policy where most states choose actions that have a higher chance of moving towards the goal. For example:

- States in the top-left (0) might choose action 1 or 2.
- Moving right or down could be better for progressing towards state 15.

But I need to ensure each params[i] is an integer between 0 and 3, mapping to a specific action.

Perhaps setting up a policy where:

- In the top row (states 0-3), prefer moving right (action 1) or down (action 0 or others).
- In the first column (states 0,4,8,12), prefer moving down.
- In other states, choose actions that can move towards state 15.

Wait, but each action has three possible directions. So I need to pick an action for each state such that at least one of its outcomes moves closer to the goal.

For example:

- State 0: choosing action 2 (which could move up, right, or down). Moving right is better.
- State 1: action 3 (right, up, left) – moving right again.
- And so on, trying to push towards state 15.

Alternatively, maybe a deterministic policy that moves towards the goal in each step, considering the grid's structure.

But I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to propose a new set of params that haven't been tried before and could potentially reach the goal more effectively.

Looking at previous attempts, most had low rewards, so perhaps suggesting a policy where the agent tends to move right or down when possible would help.

I'll construct such a policy:

- For states on the top row (0-3), choose actions that tend to move right.
- For states on the first column (0,4,8,12), choose actions that tend to move down.
- Elsewhere, choose actions that can lead towards state 15.

Translating this into params:

- State 0: action 1 (right, down, left) – prefers right.
- State 1: action 3 (right, up, left) – prefers right.
- Similarly for other top states.
- For first column, choose action that can move down.

Wait, but each action has different possible moves. For example:

Action 0 from state i could lead to [down, left, up].
Action 1: [right, down, left].
Action 2: [up, right, down].
Action 3: [left, up, right].

So, for state 0 (top-left), choosing action 1 would allow moving right or down. That seems good.

For state 4 (which is (0,1) in the grid? Wait no—state 4 is the second row, first column (row=1, col=0). So from state 4, to get to the bottom-right, moving down might be better.

Wait, perhaps I should map each state's position:

State 0: (0,0)
State 1: (0,1)
...
State 3: (0,3)
State 4: (1,0)
...
State 7: (1,3)
State 8: (2,0)
...
State 15: (3,3)

So from state 0, moving right (to state 1) or down (state 4) are good.

Similarly, in state 1, moving right to state 2 is better.

In state 4, moving down to state 8 would help move towards the goal.

But with the slippery nature, each action has three possible outcomes. So for example, if I choose action 1 (right, down, left) from state 0, there's a chance it moves right or down, both good directions.

Let me try setting up params where in each state, the action chosen is one that includes moving towards the goal in at least two of its possible outcomes.

Alternatively, perhaps choosing actions that have a higher probability of moving in the desired direction.

But since I can't remember previous attempts except for what's given, I need to make sure this new set hasn't been tried before and could provide useful information.

Looking back, the top 3 best had f(params) around 0.25-0.30. The recent params have f=0. So maybe suggesting a more aggressive policy towards moving right or down would help.

I'll propose the following:

params[0]:1 (action 1: right, down, left)
params[1]:3 (action 3: right, up, left)
params[2]:2 (action 2: up, right, down) but from state 2, which is (0,2), moving right would be better.
Wait, perhaps action 1 is better for state 2 as well.

Alternatively, maybe setting all top row to action 1 and first column to action 0.

But I need to make sure each params[i] is unique in some way from previous attempts.

Given that the recent attempts have f(params) of 0, which suggests they didn't reach the goal or fell into holes, perhaps a more conservative approach is needed. Maybe ensuring that in states near the bottom-right, the actions lead directly to state 15.

Alternatively, focusing on avoiding holes by choosing safe moves.

But without knowing where the holes are, it's hard to design around them. So perhaps a general strategy of moving towards the goal is still best.

Let me outline the proposed params:

For states in row 0 (states 0-3), choose actions that move right or down.
For states in column 0 (states 0,4,8,12), choose action 0 or 1 to move down or right.
Elsewhere, choose actions that can lead towards state 15.

But translating this into specific params values:

params[0]:1
params[1]:3
params[2]:1
params[3]:3
params[4]:0 (action 0: down, left, up) but from state 4, moving down is better.
Wait, action 0 from state 4 would move to [down (state 8), left (state 3), up (state 0)].

So choosing action 0 for state 4 could help move towards state 8, which is closer to the goal.

Similarly, in state 8 (row 2, col 0), moving down with action 0 would lead to state 12.

In state 12 (row 3, col 0), choosing an action that can move right or up/down.

But from state 12, moving right leads to state 13, which is closer to the goal. So perhaps choose action 3 for state 12: [left, up, right] – so there's a chance to move right.

Similarly, in state 13 (row 3, col 1), choosing an action that can move right or down? But since it's already at the bottom row, moving right is better.

Wait, but each action has three possible moves. For example:

In state 12: action 0 would lead to [down (stuck?), left (state 8), up (state 4)].
But wait, from state 12, down would stay in the same row? Or is it that moving down from state 12 would wrap around or is invalid? No, the grid is 4x4, so moving down from state 12 (row 3) would be impossible—probably stays in place or is considered a hole. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps action 0 from state 12 leads to staying in place or another direction.

This is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to propose a policy where each state chooses an action that has at least one move towards the goal and hasn't been tried before.

Given the time constraints and the need to output the params, I'll construct a new set of params where:

- For states in the top row (0-3), choose action 1 or 2.
- For states in the first column (0,4,8,12), choose action 0 or 1.
- Elsewhere, choose actions that can move towards state 15.

Let me try assigning:

params[0]:1
params[1]:3
params[2]:1
params[3]:3
params[4]:0
params[5]:1
params[6]:1
params[7]:2
params[8]:3
params[9]:1
params[10]:2
params[11]:0
params[12]:1
params[13]:2
params[14]:3
params[15]:3

This is a mix of actions, trying to move towards the goal while considering possible moves. I think this setup hasn't been tried before and could potentially yield better rewards.
