You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to find the global optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment using a policy gradient method. The user provided some parameters and wants me to determine the best action probabilities for each state.

First, I remember that in reinforcement learning, policy gradients are used when we don't have access to the reward function but can observe the transition probabilities and rewards. Here, the environment is slippery, meaning each action leads to a random next state with equal probability, except maybe for some holes. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right), which gives +1 reward.

The policy is represented as an array of 16 values, where each value corresponds to the probability of choosing one of the four actions from that state. Each action is numbered from 0 to 3, representing different directions: down, left, up, and right.

Looking at the example provided, params[0] was set to 2, meaning action 2 (which is 'up') has a higher probability there. But this seems like just one instance. To find the global optimum, I need to explore various parameter combinations that could yield better rewards over time through exploration and possibly using gradient ascent.

I think about the possible values for each action: [0,1,2,3], each corresponding to different actions. Since all params are in this set, I can try a variety of combinations to see which gives the highest expected reward.

Maybe I should start by trying some symmetrical policies where certain states have similar probabilities. For example, if state 0 has action 2 with high probability, perhaps others also follow similar patterns due to symmetry.

Alternatively, since the environment is slippery, each action from a state leads to three possible next states, each with equal probability. This makes it harder because the choice of actions can affect the exploration rate and the chance of stepping on holes.

I recall that for policy gradients, you might use methods like natural gradient ascent or reparameterization tricks. However, I'm not sure if that's necessary here since the parameters are discrete values from 0 to 3. Maybe a simpler approach is sufficient.

Perhaps I should try all combinations where the probabilities sum up correctly (each state has exactly one action selected). But with each state having four possible actions, it's too many to check manually.

Another idea is to consider that the optimal policy might have higher probabilities on certain states that are more rewarding. For instance, in some grid-based environments, the starting positions might be better explored by choosing actions that allow for more exploration and not getting stuck.

I should also think about how the reward function affects the policy. Since state 15 gives +1, I want to maximize the chances of reaching it as quickly as possible. So, policies that lead towards this state with high probability might perform well.

Maybe starting by experimenting with some actions more often than others in symmetric states would help. For example, setting certain actions higher in their respective symmetric groups could balance exploration and reward maximization.

I think I'll start by trying a few different parameter configurations, focusing on what seems logical based on the environment's structure. Perhaps setting action 2 (up) as high as possible where applicable to encourage movement back up after falling into holes might be beneficial.
