You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get a reward of 1 by reaching state 15 without falling into any holes. The environment is slippery, which means each action taken has a probability of moving in three possible directions.

First, I need to understand the structure of the environment. It's a 4x4 grid with states numbered from 0 to 15. State 15 is the goal, and other states are just transitions until you either reach the goal or fall into a hole. The agent can move left, right, up, or down, but each action has three possible outcomes due to the slipperiness.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 numbers, where each number corresponds to the action taken in that state (0-3). My task is to propose different policies to maximize the reward. The optimal reward should be around 1.0, meaning the agent successfully reaches the goal most of the time.

Looking at the previous interactions and top-performing params, I see that many of them have an average reward around 0.35-0.45. This suggests that while they're getting some success in reaching the goal, there's room for improvement to get closer to 1.0.

I notice that the most recent policies tried aren't performing well—some even got a reward of 0.00. That indicates those policies might be leading the agent into holes or stuck in loops without reaching the goal. So, I need to think about what's causing this and how to adjust.

One key aspect is ensuring that each state's action doesn't lead the agent into a hole with any probability. For example, if from a certain state, taking an action has a chance of moving into a hole, we should avoid that action. So, I need to identify which states are holes and ensure the policy avoids actions leading there.

From the trajectories provided, some ended because the agent fell into a hole or reached the goal. For example, one trajectory went (0,3) (1,3) ... which might be moving right from state 0 to 3, then again taking an action that led further towards a possible hole.

To improve, I should focus on designing a policy where each state's action leads towards the goal without any risk of falling into holes. This means mapping out safe paths and ensuring that for each state, the chosen action maximizes progress towards the goal while avoiding risky moves.

I also need to consider the slipperiness—each action has three possible outcomes, so the policy must account for these probabilities. For instance, choosing an action that mostly leads towards the goal with a high probability would be better.

Looking at the top-performing policies, they seem to have some structure where states in the upper rows move down and right, while avoiding left or up moves unless necessary. But since the environment is slippery, sometimes moving right might lead the agent into a hole if not careful.

I should try to find a balance between exploration and exploitation. Since the goal is around 1.0 reward, which suggests near-perfect success, I need policies that reliably reach the goal without failure.

One approach could be to structure the policy so that from each state, the action chosen has the highest probability of moving towards the goal or staying on a safe path. For example, in the top-left corner (state 0), choosing an action that mostly moves down towards state 4, which is the next row's start.

Another consideration is to ensure that once the agent gets closer to the goal, it doesn't take risky actions that could lead it back or into a hole. Maybe setting up the policy so that from states near the bottom-right (like 12, 13, 14, 15), actions are directed towards 15 without any chance of moving left or up.

I also need to make sure that each proposed params array is unique and hasn't been tried before. From the history provided, I can see several patterns in previous policies, so I should avoid repeating those unless they're part of a strategy to optimize around the best-performing ones.

Given that the current top reward is 0.45, which is below 1.0, it's essential to explore more thoroughly and perhaps try different paths or adjust actions in critical states to see if we can push the reward higher.

In summary, I need to propose a new params array where each state's action is chosen to maximize the chance of reaching the goal while avoiding any possibility of falling into holes. This might involve mapping out safe trajectories from each state and selecting actions that keep the agent on these paths with high probability.
