You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with as high a reward as possible. From what I understand, the environment is slippery, meaning that each action taken by the agent results in moving in one of three directions with equal probability. That adds some uncertainty to the movement.

Looking at the problem, I need to propose a policy (params) where each state from 0 to 15 maps to an action (0-3). The challenge is to avoid holes and maximize the chance of reaching the goal. The best reward so far is around 0.45, which isn't great. Ideally, we want it to reach close to 1.0.

In the recent attempts, most policies have resulted in trajectories that either get stuck or don't progress towards the goal effectively. For example, some policies loop in the same states without making progress, like (0,3) repeated multiple times leading to a hole or not moving forward.

I think I need to adjust the policy to encourage more movement towards the right and down directions since state 15 is at the bottom-right corner. But because of the slipperiness, the agent's intended action might lead it in any of three possible directions. So, perhaps choosing actions that have a higher probability of moving towards the goal even with the uncertainty.

Let me consider each state:

- For states near the top or left, moving right or down would be better to head towards the goal.
- Avoiding holes is crucial, so I need to know where the holes are. From the trajectories provided, some states seem to lead to holes when certain actions are taken. For instance, taking action 3 from state 0 might not be ideal if it leads to a hole.

Looking at previous params, many of them have params[0] set to 1 or 2. Action 1 from state 0 could mean moving right, down, or left with equal chance. Similarly, action 2 might involve more upward movement which isn't helpful for going towards the goal.

I should consider making the policy such that each state directs towards the right and down as much as possible, considering the slipperiness. Maybe setting actions that have a higher tendency to move in the desired direction while avoiding holes.

But since I don't know where the holes are exactly, I need to make educated guesses based on the trajectories provided. For example, if taking action 3 from state 0 leads to (1,0), which might be safe or not. From the trajectories, some agents end up in loops, so perhaps certain actions lead them into traps.

I think a possible approach is to set each state's action to one that maximizes the chance of moving towards the goal while considering all possible next states and avoiding holes.

But without knowing the exact hole positions, it's tricky. Maybe I can look at the best performing params from previous iterations. The top performer had f(params) 0.45, which is better than others but still not great. Perhaps tweaking that policy slightly could help.

Looking at the trajectory of the top-performing params: (0,1) leads to state 4, then action 2 leads to state 8, and so on. Maybe adjusting some actions in states near the edges to avoid getting stuck or falling into holes.

I'll try to propose a new set of params where each state is directed towards right and down as much as possible, considering the slip probabilities. For example:

- States in the top row should move down (action 0) or right (action 1).
- Middle states should prefer moving down or right.
- Avoid actions that could lead to known holes.

But since I can't remember previous attempts, I have to make each suggestion unique and not repeat any params from before. Maybe I'll adjust some of the actions in key states to see if it improves the trajectory towards the goal without hitting holes.
