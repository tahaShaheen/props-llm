You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, let's try to figure out the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. So, from what I understand, it's a 4x4 grid where each cell is a state, numbered from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). The goal is to reach state 15, and there are some holes that end the episode if stepped on.

The agent can move in four directions, but because of the slippery nature, taking an action leads to three possible next states with equal probability. Each action has its own set of possible moves. For example, action 0 (left) could lead to down, left, or up, each with a 1/3 chance.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 elements, where each element corresponds to the action taken in that state. The challenge is to find the best set of actions across all states to maximize the average reward, which should ideally be around 1.0 if we reach the goal successfully every time.

Looking at the provided information, I see several previous policies and their corresponding rewards. The highest reward so far is 0.45, which isn't very close to the target of 1.0. This suggests that the current strategies are not consistently reaching the goal without falling into holes. So, as an explorer, I should focus on trying new configurations rather than tweaking existing ones.

I notice that in some policies, certain states (like state 0) have actions that might lead towards the goal but with a lot of uncertainty due to the slippery nature. For example, action 1 from state 0 seems common, which could move down, right, or left. But this might not be the most efficient path.

I should consider how each action in each state contributes to avoiding holes and progressing toward the goal. Maybe some states need to prioritize certain directions more than others. For instance, being near the bottom-right corner (state 15) is already the goal, so actions there should stay on that state or have no effect since it's terminal.

I also see that in previous policies, state 15 often has action 3, which allows movement left, up, or right. But once you're at 15, moving right would go out of bounds, and the environment might reset or something—probably not desired. So maybe state 15 should have an action that keeps it there or doesn't move.

Another point is that certain states are more critical than others. For example, being in the middle (state 7) might require careful action selection to avoid falling into nearby holes and to move towards the goal efficiently.

I think I'll need to adjust the actions for some key states:

1. **State 0**: Maybe action 2 (up) isn't useful since it's already at the top, so perhaps action 1 or 3 to head right or down.
2. **States along the bottom row (12-15)**: Need to make sure they either stay put or move towards 15 without stepping into holes.
3. **States near the edges**: Actions should avoid moving into hole states.

Given that previous policies have had limited success, I'll try a new configuration where each state's action is chosen to either directly approach the goal or minimize the risk of falling into holes by avoiding known dangerous moves.

I'll propose a new set of params where each state selects an action that balances moving towards the goal and reducing slipperiness risks. For example:

- States in row 3 (bottom) might choose actions that move right or down to approach 15.
- Middle states should avoid left movements if there are holes on the left.

I'll ensure that all params values are unique from previous attempts to gather new information about their effectiveness.
