You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15, which gives a reward of +1, while avoiding the holes that end the episode with zero reward.

First, I need to understand the environment properly. It's a 4x4 grid, so states are numbered from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). The movement is tricky because the environment is slippery—each action leads to one of three possible directions with equal probability. So when an agent chooses an action, it doesn't go exactly where it wants; instead, there's a 33% chance each for three possible moves.

Looking at the previous attempts and trajectories provided, most policies aren't performing very well, as their rewards are around 0.25-0.45. The best so far is 0.45, but we need to reach closer to 1.0, which would mean almost always succeeding.

I remember that in the original FrozenLake problem without slipping, the optimal policy would be deterministic, moving right and down towards the goal. But here, because of the slippery nature, it's more complex. The agent needs a strategy that accounts for the probabilistic movements.

From the top 5 best performing params, I notice a pattern where certain states have specific actions. For example, state 0 often chooses action 1 or 2, which might be attempts to move right or up. But since the environment is slippery, these choices lead to variable paths.

Looking at the trajectories, some policies get stuck in loops or fall into holes because they don't adequately avoid them. So, the key is to design a policy that not only navigates towards the goal but also avoids the holes as much as possible.

Since we're stateless and can't remember previous attempts, each suggestion should aim to maximize information gain. If the rewards are low, I should explore new configurations; if they're high, tweak around the best ones.

Given that most recent policies have lower rewards (0.05, 0.00), it suggests we might need to switch strategies or try different actions in critical states where holes are present.

I think a good approach would be to make sure that when the agent is near the goal, it has a high chance of reaching it without slipping into a hole. Also, in states adjacent to holes, choosing actions that minimize the risk of falling into them is crucial.

Looking at state 15 (the goal), we want it to stay there or have actions that keep it from moving away. But since state 15 is terminal, maybe once reached, it doesn't matter. However, for states leading to 15, like 14 and 10, the policy should encourage moves towards 15.

In the previous best params, state 12 (which is in row 3, column 1) has action 1, which might be moving right or other directions. But perhaps changing that to a more direct approach would help.

Another thing to consider is symmetry and how each action's probabilities affect movement. For example, choosing actions that have a higher chance of moving towards the goal direction despite the slipperiness.

I think I'll propose a policy where states closer to the goal are encouraged to move right or down, depending on their position, while avoiding directions leading to holes. Also, in areas with known holes, the policy should take actions that minimize the risk of falling into them based on previous trajectories.

After considering all this, I'll adjust some key states' actions to try and navigate more directly towards the goal while avoiding risky moves.
