You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. It's a 4x4 grid where the agent can move in four directions, but due to slipperiness, each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability. The goal is state 15 (the bottom right corner), which gives +1 reward, and all other states give 0 except for the holes which end the episode.

The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers, each corresponding to a state from 0 to 15, indicating the action to take. The challenge is to propose these parameters step by step, aiming for the highest possible reward, ideally around 1.0.

Looking at the history provided, there have been several attempts with varying rewards. The best so far is 0.45, but it's still below 1.0, which suggests that we're not consistently reaching the goal without falling into holes.

I notice that in the recent trials, some policies are getting stuck or leading to falls. For example, the most recent params led to a reward of 0.00 and trajectories that looped around without progress. So, I need to figure out which states might be problematic or which actions could lead towards the goal more effectively.

Since the environment is slippery, the agent's intended action doesn't always result in the expected movement. Therefore, the policy must account for this uncertainty. Each action choice should have a high probability of moving closer to the goal without stepping into holes.

I should consider the structure of the grid and plan paths that are less likely to fall into holes. For instance, states near the edges or corners might be more risky. So, actions from these states should aim towards safer, hole-free areas.

Looking at state 0 (top-left corner), action choices could influence early progress. Action 1 (which can move right, down, or left) might help in exploring without immediate risk. Similarly, for other starting positions, choosing actions that generally lead towards the goal while avoiding holes seems crucial.

I think I need to adjust the policy so that more states direct towards state 15. Perhaps setting certain states to always move right or down when possible could increase the chances of reaching the goal despite the slipperiness.

Also, considering the slip probabilities, each action has a 33% chance of moving in any of three directions. So, the policy must be robust enough that even if some moves are incorrect, overall progress towards the goal is maintained.

Maybe I should look at the states leading up to state 15 and ensure they have actions that would eventually bring the agent closer. For example, state 14 (which is one step left of 15) should take an action that can lead right or down, but since it's already near the goal, perhaps moving right is optimal.

I also need to avoid any actions that could lead into holes. So, for states adjacent to holes, their actions should be chosen carefully to minimize the risk.

Given all this, I'll propose a new set of parameters where each state directs towards the goal in a way that avoids known holes and takes advantage of the grid's structure.
