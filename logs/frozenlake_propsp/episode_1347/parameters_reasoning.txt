You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. It's a 4x4 grid where each state is represented by numbers from 0 to 15. The goal is to reach state 15, but there are holes that end the episode if stepped on. The agent can move in four directions, but because of the slippery nature, taking an action leads to one of three possible moves with equal probability.

First, I need to understand how the policy works. Each state has a parameter (params[i]) that selects which action to take. The actions are 0-3, each corresponding to different movement probabilities. Since the environment is stochastic, the agent's path can vary even with the same policy.

Looking at the top-performing params provided earlier, they all have an average reward of around 0.45. That's below the target of 1.0, so I'm in the exploration phase since rewards aren't close to optimal yet. My goal is to suggest a new set of params that hasn't been tried before and could potentially explore more efficiently.

The recent trials had low rewards (like 0.00), which suggests that previous policies might be getting stuck or falling into holes frequently. So I need a policy that avoids these pitfalls by making safer choices in states where there are holes.

I'll start by identifying the hole positions, but since they aren't explicitly given, I have to infer based on trajectories. For example, if a trajectory ends quickly in a hole, that state is probably a hole. From the recent trajectories, some ended when stepping into state 8 or 13. So states like 4,5,6,7 might be safer since they're earlier in the grid.

I'll consider setting actions for each state to move towards the goal (state 15) while minimizing the risk of falling into holes. For example, in state 0 (top-left), moving right or down makes sense because moving up isn't possible. But considering the slippery nature, I need to choose an action that has a higher chance of moving towards the goal without risking falling.

Let me try to create a policy where each state's action is chosen to move as close to the goal as possible while avoiding likely holes. For states in the top row (0-3), moving right or down would help progress towards the goal. Similarly, for other rows, choosing actions that move closer to the bottom-right.

I'll go through each state and assign an action:

- State 0: Moving right (action 1) allows movement to state 1, which is safer.
- States 1-3: Maybe moving down or right depending on position.
- For states in the second row (4-7), actions should move towards higher-numbered states but avoid falling into possible holes.

I'll try a policy where most states choose action 0, which has movement options down, left, and up. But I need to make sure it doesn't lead into holes. Alternatively, action 1 might be better for some states as it allows right, down, or left moves.

Wait, but looking at the previous top params, they used a mix of actions 0-3. Maybe I should vary the actions to explore different paths and see which leads to success.

I think setting up a policy where each state has a balanced approach towards moving towards the goal while avoiding risky moves could help. For example, in state 14 (second-to-last row), choosing action 2 or 3 might lead closer to 15 without falling into holes.

Considering all this, I'll propose a new set of params that is different from the previous ones. Let's assign each state an action that moves towards the goal with some variance to avoid holes and explore different paths.
