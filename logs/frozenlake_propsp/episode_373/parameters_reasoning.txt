You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to find the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment using an iterative policy gradient method. The goal is to reach state 15 (the right bottom grid) which gives a reward of +1, and all other states give 0. There's also some holes in the map that can trap the agent if stepped on.

The policy is represented by an array where each element corresponds to a state (from 0 to 15). The value of each parameter in the 'params' array determines which action to take when in that state. Each parameter is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, and choosing these values will affect how the agent explores the environment.

I remember that the goal is to maximize the expected reward over time. Since it's a reinforcement learning problem with an unknown optimal policy, I'll need to use an algorithm like Q-learning or policy gradient methods. The user mentioned using policy gradients, so maybe I'm thinking of using the policy gradient method where we update the policy based on sampled trajectories.

First, I should consider how the policy affects the exploration versus exploitation. If I set all parameters to 0, that might lead the agent to move down (action 2) every time from state 0, which is a deterministic approach. But this could be suboptimal because it might get stuck in loops or miss certain paths.

On the other hand, using parameters with higher values like 3 (which means taking action 1, 3, or 4 directions equally) might encourage more exploration by avoiding immediate rewards. However, if I set too many parameters to this, the agent could start favoring random actions, which might lead it into holes.

Looking at the top performing params in the example given, they seem to balance exploration and exploitation by sometimes taking deterministic actions (like 0 or 1) while other times exploring nearby states. For instance, some have action 2 (up), others have action 3 (left, up, down). This suggests that a good policy would mix deterministic and stochastic transitions, allowing the agent to explore neighboring states without getting too stuck.

I should also think about how the reward function affects this. Since holes can trap the agent if stepped on, I need a way for the algorithm to learn whether stepping into a hole is beneficial or not. The episodic reward f(params) gives us that, and with enough iterations, we aim to maximize this value.

Considering all these factors, it seems like a good starting point would be to test a range of parameter values, perhaps including both deterministic (0-1) and fully stochastic (2-3) transitions, as well as combinations in between. Starting with parameters around 1 or 2 might provide a good balance.

I'll propose testing the following values: for states 0 and 15, keeping action 2 (up) to avoid stepping into holes. For other states, perhaps using some combination of actions. Testing both deterministic and stochastic policies could help see which one performs better.
