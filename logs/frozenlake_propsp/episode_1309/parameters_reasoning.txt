You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The agent is on a 4x4 grid, and it's slippery, meaning actions don't always lead directly to the intended state—instead, each action causes the agent to move in one of three directions with equal probability.

The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) for a reward of +1, but there are holes that end the episode if stepped on. The policy is represented by an array of 16 actions, where each index corresponds to a state and holds a value from 0-3 indicating the action to take.

Looking at the top 7 best-performing params provided earlier, they all have average rewards around 0.45. That's significantly below the target of 1.0, which suggests that we're not yet optimal. The trajectories show loops and repeated states, indicating possible issues with getting stuck or falling into holes.

The most recent policies have even lower rewards (like 0.20 and 0.00), so it seems like the agent is either hitting holes more often or not reaching the goal efficiently. My task now is to propose a new set of params that might improve this situation.

I need to consider how each state's action choice affects the likelihood of reaching the goal without falling into holes. Since the environment is slippery, actions have multiple possible outcomes. So for each state, I should choose an action that maximizes the chance of moving towards the goal while minimizing the risk of hitting a hole.

Looking at the current best policies, many are choosing action 1 or 3 for states like 0 and 1. Action 1 (right/down/left) might be causing the agent to move left into holes. Maybe switching to action 2 (up/right/down) could help? Or perhaps using different actions for each state based on their position.

I should also consider that some states are more dangerous than others. For example, being near the edges or certain positions increases the risk of falling into a hole. So the policy needs to navigate carefully around these areas.

Another thought: since the agent's movement is probabilistic, choosing actions that have a higher chance of moving towards the goal might help. For instance, in state 0 (top-left), moving right and down could be safer than other options. But I need to see how each action from each state affects possible next states.

I should create a policy where each state's action is chosen to either directly aim for the goal or move towards safe areas that increase the chances of eventually reaching the goal without hitting a hole.

After considering all these factors, here's a new set of params. I'll choose actions that balance moving towards the goal while avoiding risky moves. For example, in the starting states (0 and 1), choosing right might help move towards state 3 or 4, which are closer to the goal. In other states, selecting actions that have a higher probability of leading towards the bottom-right without hitting holes.

params[0]: 1; params[1]: 2; params[2]: 1; params[3]: 3; params[4]: 2; params[5]: 3; params[6]: 0; params[7]: 2; params[8]: 1; params[9]: 2; params[10]: 3; params[11]: 0; params[12]: 2; params[13]: 3; params[14]: 1; params[15]: 3
