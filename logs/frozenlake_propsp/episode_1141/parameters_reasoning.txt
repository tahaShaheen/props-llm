You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help optimize a policy for the FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get the highest possible reward by reaching state 15 without falling into any holes. From the problem description, I understand that each action taken can lead to three possible directions with equal probability due to the slippery nature of the environment.

Looking at the provided trajectories and rewards, it seems like most policies are getting around 0.35 or lower as their average reward over 20 episodes. The top-performing policy had a reward of 0.45, which is still below the target of 1.0. This suggests that there's room for improvement.

I notice that in the recent attempts, some policies are leading to very long trajectories without reaching the goal, or they're falling into holes quickly. For example, one trajectory went through multiple states but never reached state 15, ending up in a hole instead. 

Since the environment is slippery, the agent's movement isn't guaranteed, so the policy needs to account for this uncertainty. Maybe the optimal strategy involves actions that have a higher chance of moving towards the goal while minimizing the risk of falling into holes.

Looking at the current policies, many of them are choosing action 1 or 3 in state 0 (top-left corner). Action 1 from state 0 can lead to down, left, or right with equal probability. If we take action 1, moving right would be better because it moves towards state 1, which is adjacent to the goal. Alternatively, action 3 might allow for more varied movement.

I think a good starting point would be to have the policy in state 0 (params[0]) choose an action that maximizes the probability of moving right or down, as those directions are closer to the goal. Maybe action 1 is better because it can move right with some chance, which is directly towards state 1.

For other states, especially near the edges and potential holes, the policy should be cautious. For example, if a state is next to a hole, the actions chosen should avoid moving into that direction unless necessary.

Given that previous policies haven't achieved the optimal reward, perhaps we need to adjust certain states to change their action mappings in a way that either avoids known dangerous paths or pushes towards the goal more directly.

Looking at the trajectories, some agents are getting stuck in loops, like going between states 0 and 1 repeatedly. This indicates that the policy might not be taking the most efficient path. So maybe adjusting certain actions to break these loops would help.

I also notice that in state 7 (which is near the top-right corner), if an agent takes action 2 or 3, it could move towards the goal or into a hole. So perhaps setting params[7] to choose actions that have higher chance of moving right or down would be better.

In summary, to improve the policy, I should consider changing some action mappings in states where agents are getting stuck or falling into holes. For instance, adjusting state 0 to take action 1 might help move towards state 1, which is closer to the goal. Also, ensuring that other critical states have actions that minimize the risk of falling into holes while progressing towards state 15.

After considering all this, I'll propose a new set of params where some key states have their actions adjusted to potentially break loops and increase the chances of reaching the goal.
