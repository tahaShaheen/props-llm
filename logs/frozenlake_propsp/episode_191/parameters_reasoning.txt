You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy parameters for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15, which is the bottom right corner, and each step gives a reward of +1 if we land on it. All other states give a reward of 0.

The agent's action choices depend on the current state. Let me recall the rules:

- When in action 0 (down), it picks from [move down, left, up], each with equal probability.
- Action 1 (right) chooses between right, down, left equally.
- Action 2 (up) has up, right, down options.
- Action 3 (left) selects left, up, right.

The challenge is to find the optimal policy that maximizes the expected reward. Since all other states have rewards of 0 except for state 15, which gives +1, we need a strategy that avoids stepping into any holes and efficiently navigates to state 15.

I remember that in such grid-based environments, using an epsilon-greedy policy with small epsilon can explore more areas but might not always take the optimal path. However, since the environment is deterministic (except for the action choices), I need a deterministic approach.

Looking at the provided examples of params, they have various combinations like [2,0,3,2], which could lead to some interesting paths. But without testing, it's hard to know if these are optimal.

I think about possible states that might be problematic. For example, state (1,1) or (2,0), where stepping into a hole can end the game. So the policy should avoid such areas as much as possible.

Also, I need to ensure that when an action leads towards the goal, it's taken with higher probability so that the agent explores efficiently without getting stuck in local optima.

I should probably try different combinations for params[0] and [1], which determine the actions from state 0 and 1. For instance, if both are set to 3 (left), the agent would move left from these states, which might take it away from the goal or into a hole.

If I mix up some values, maybe that could help. For example, sometimes taking a step towards the goal and sometimes avoiding holes when possible.

But without testing each combination, it's hard to be precise. Maybe I should start by trying parameters where certain actions are taken more often. Let me try a few possibilities.

Wait, let me think about state (1,0). If from there, action 0 leads up or left or right. But in the examples provided, some have params[1] set to 3 (left), which could be a problem if that leads into a hole.

Alternatively, using action 1 (right) when possible might not always lead towards the goal but ensure movement is upwards.

I think a good starting point would be to try parameters where certain actions are more likely. For example, params[0] and [1] set to 2 or 3 might encourage moving in different directions.

Looking back at some example params:

One of them has params[0]:2, params[1]:0, params[2]:3, etc., which leads towards the right or up from state 0. Maybe that's a good path.

Another has params[0]:1, which could mean taking more random actions but perhaps also moving left in some cases.

I think to avoid getting stuck in local optima, I should allow for some randomness (epsilon) so the agent doesn't get trapped on holes. But since we're allowed to set all params first, maybe focusing on deterministic exploration is better.

Perhaps a policy that always takes action 3 (left) when possible except near state 15 would be safe but not optimal. Alternatively, balancing between exploring and exploiting.

In any case, without further testing, I'll try some parameters that might balance movement towards the goal while avoiding holes. Maybe setting params[0] to 2 (down), which is a common way to explore nearby states.
