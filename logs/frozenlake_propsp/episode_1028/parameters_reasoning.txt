You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment to maximize the reward. The goal is to get an average episodic reward as close to 1.0 as possible, which means reaching state 15 without falling into any holes.

First, let's understand the environment. It's a 4x4 grid where each cell can be a hole or not. The agent moves in four directions, but because of the slippery nature, taking an action leads to three possible next states with equal probability. So, from any state, moving left, right, up, or down isn't guaranteed; there's a chance it might go another way.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 integers (params), each ranging from 0-3, representing the action taken in each state. The challenge is to set these params such that the agent maximizes its chances of reaching state 15 without falling into any holes.

Looking at the provided examples and trajectories, I notice that some policies are getting stuck or falling into loops, leading to low rewards (like 0.20 or even 0.00). This suggests that current policies might be taking actions that lead back to previous states, causing infinite loops without making progress towards the goal.

Since the average reward is still around 0.35-0.45, which is much lower than the target of 1.0, I should focus on exploring new policies rather than optimizing existing ones. The strategy here is to maximize information gain by trying out different configurations that haven't been tested before.

I need to create a policy where each state's action is chosen in a way that avoids known holes and pushes the agent towards the goal (state 15). Let's consider how each state can be navigated optimally:

- **State 0 (top-left corner)**: Possible actions are move down, right, or left. Moving right might lead towards the goal faster, so maybe action 1 (which has a mix of right and other directions) could be good.
  
- **States along the top row (0-3)**: To reach state 15, moving right is essential. So actions that encourage movement to the right are better.

- **Middle states**: These need careful handling to avoid falling into holes below. Actions should balance between moving towards the goal and avoiding downward moves if there's a hole directly below.

Looking at the current best params, they have a mix of actions, but perhaps some states aren't being handled optimally. For example, state 7 is in the second row last column; moving down from here would lead to state 11, which is one step closer to the goal. So maybe action 2 (which has up, right, down) could be better.

I'll try to adjust some of the actions for states that seem problematic based on their trajectories. For instance, in state 4, if moving down leads to a hole, then perhaps choosing an action that avoids that direction is necessary.

After considering all these factors, I propose the following params, making sure each state's action hasn't been tried before and aligns with the strategy of moving towards the goal while avoiding holes.
