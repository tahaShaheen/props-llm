You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me start by understanding the problem thoroughly.

The environment is a 4x4 grid where the agent can move in four directions: left, down, right, up. Each action taken by the agent doesn't lead directly to the desired movement because of the slippery nature—each action results in one of three possible moves with equal probability. The goal is state 15 (the bottom-right corner), which gives a reward of +1, while all other states give 0. There are also holes that end the episode if stepped on.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 parameters, each indicating the action to take in a specific state (from 0 to 15). The challenge is to choose these actions such that the agent avoids holes and reaches the goal as often as possible.

Looking at the provided information, there are some top-performing policies with average rewards around 0.45, which is lower than the target of 1.0. This suggests that we need to explore further or tweak existing strategies.

The most recent parameters suggest that certain states have specific actions set. For example, in state 0, action 2 was tried but didn't yield a high reward. Maybe trying different actions for state 0 could help. Similarly, looking at the trajectories, some agents are getting stuck or falling into holes because their policies lead them astray.

Since we're at iteration 965 and need to propose the next set of parameters, I should focus on maximizing information gain. Given that rewards aren't close to optimal yet, perhaps exploring different strategies would be beneficial.

I'll consider changing some key states' actions to see how they affect the trajectory. For instance, state 0 could try action 3 (right) instead of others to move towards state 1 or another promising path. Also, states near the goal should have actions that increase the chance of reaching it without falling into holes.

I'll also check if any recent parameters had higher rewards and see what their structure was. Maybe adjusting a few key states' actions based on those could improve performance.

After considering these factors, I think proposing a new set of parameters where certain critical states have different actions might help in exploring new trajectories that avoid holes and get closer to the goal.
