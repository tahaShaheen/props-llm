You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. I'm trying to help optimize the policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get a reward of 1 by reaching state 15 without falling into any holes. The environment is slippery, so each action has three possible outcomes with equal probability.

From the problem description, I know that the agent's policy is represented by an array of 16 parameters, each corresponding to a state (0-15) and indicating which action to take. The actions are 0,1,2,3, each leading to different movement possibilities. The challenge is to find the optimal set of these parameters to maximize the reward.

Looking at the provided data, I see that the best performing policies so far have an average reward around 0.30. That's significantly below the target of 1.0, which suggests that the current policies aren't reaching the goal consistently. There might be holes in certain states that are causing the agent to fall into them frequently.

The trajectories show that some policies get stuck or loop without reaching the goal. For example, one trajectory starts at (0,1) and moves down multiple times but doesn't reach 15. Another gets stuck in a hole early on. This indicates that the current policy might not be effectively navigating towards the goal state while avoiding hazards.

Since the average reward is still low, I should act as an explorer. My goal now is to propose new parameter configurations that haven't been tried before and could potentially lead to better performance.

I need to consider how each action from a state can help reach the goal or avoid holes. For example, states near the bottom right (like 12, 13, 14, 15) should ideally move towards 15. If a state is next to a hole, the policy should choose actions that don't lead into it.

Let me think about specific states. State 15 is the goal, so no action needed there—it's terminal. States adjacent to 15 (like 14, 11) should move towards 15. Holes are present in some states; I need to make sure that from those states, actions don't lead into the holes.

Looking at the current policies, many have similar structures where certain states always choose action 0 or 3, which might not be optimal due to the slippery nature causing unintended movements.

I should try varying the actions for key states. For example, in state 14 (which is to the left of 15), perhaps choosing action 2 (up) could help reach the goal more directly, considering the slippery movement might still push towards it.

Another approach is to have a policy that prioritizes moving right and down since those directions are closer to the goal. So for states in the top-left quadrant, actions that move towards the bottom-right would be beneficial.

I'll also consider introducing some randomness but structured around the main goal direction. For instance, allowing a mix of right and down actions with higher probability could help navigate through the slippery environment more effectively.

Finally, I need to ensure that each parameter is unique from previous ones to maximize information gain in the next iteration.
