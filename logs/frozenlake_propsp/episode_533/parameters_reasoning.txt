You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help optimize a policy for the FrozenLake environment using the given setup. The goal is to find the global optimal policy that maximizes the episodic reward by reaching state 15 (the goal) while avoiding holes.

First, let me understand the problem. The environment is a 4x4 grid where each state can transition probabilistically due to the slippery nature. Each action taken by the agent results in moving to one of three possible directions with equal probability. Holes are present which end the episode if stepped on, and the reward is +1 for reaching the goal.

The policy is defined as an array of 16 elements (params[0] to params[15]), each indicating the action to take in that state. The challenge is to find the optimal set of actions that navigates the agent safely from any starting point to the goal, avoiding all holes.

Looking at the provided data, the top 6 best-performing policies have an average reward around 0.20-0.30, which is significantly below the target of 1.0. This suggests that the current policies are not effectively navigating to the goal or are falling into holes too often.

In the most recent iterations, all four proposed policies resulted in a reward of 0.00. Their trajectories show that many attempts end without reaching the goal or fall into holes quickly. For example, one trajectory starts at state 0 and loops between states without progress, ending up in a hole.

To improve, I need to propose a new set of parameters that can guide the agent more effectively towards the goal while avoiding dangerous states. Since the previous attempts are not performing well, it's crucial to explore different policies that might have better navigation strategies.

I'll consider how each state can transition and choose actions that maximize the chances of moving closer to the goal (state 15) without stepping into holes. For example, in states near the edges or corners, certain actions may be more beneficial than others.

Let me outline possible optimal paths. Starting from state 0 (top-left corner), the agent should aim to move towards the right or down, depending on the hole locations. Similarly, in other starting points, the policy should guide the agent step-by-step closer to the goal while avoiding any known holes.

I'll also consider that since each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability, the policy must account for these probabilities to maximize expected rewards. This means choosing actions that statistically increase the chances of moving towards the goal without falling into traps.

Given the current performance, it's clear that exploration is necessary rather than exploitation. So I'll propose a new set of parameters that significantly differs from previous ones, focusing on creating paths that systematically move towards state 15 while avoiding holes based on known trajectories and the environment's structure.
