You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment to maximize the episodic reward. The goal is to get a reward of 1 by reaching state 15, and avoid the holes which end the episode with 0 reward.

First, I need to understand how the environment works. It's a 4x4 grid, slippery, meaning each action has a 33% chance to go in one of three directions. The policy is an array of 16 actions (each from 0-3), where params[i] tells which action to take when in state i.

Looking at the previous top 6 best policies and their rewards, they all have f(params) around 0.35 or lower. The most recent policies also show similar low rewards, so I'm not getting close to the optimal reward of 1.0 yet. That means I need to explore more rather than exploit what's been tried before.

The key here is to avoid holes and find a path that leads to state 15. So, I should design a policy that navigates towards the goal while minimizing the risk of falling into holes. The slippery nature makes it tricky because even if you choose an action, there's uncertainty in where you'll end up.

I remember from previous policies that certain states are being stuck or not reaching the goal efficiently. For example, some trajectories get stuck in loops or don't make progress towards 15. So, I should look into making sure each state has a direction that generally moves closer to the goal but also avoids risky actions leading to holes.

Maybe I can structure the policy so that states near the top-left move right or down, depending on their position. For instance, in state 0 (top-left corner), moving right or down could be safer. But considering the slippery nature, choosing an action that has a higher probability of moving towards the goal is better.

Looking at previous policies, they often have params[0] set to 1 or 2. Action 1 from state 0 would move left, down, or right with equal chance. That might not be optimal because left would go out of bounds (probably stays in place) which isn't helpful. So maybe action 3? Wait, no—action 3 for state 0 is [left, up, right]. Hmm, but the agent can’t move up from state 0.

Wait, perhaps I should check each state's possible transitions and choose actions that maximize the chance of moving towards the goal without hitting holes. For example:

- State 15 is the goal, so it doesn't matter what action is chosen.
- States near the bottom-right (like 13, 14) should move right or up to reach 15.
- Middle states need to navigate carefully.

I think a possible approach is to have all states in the top row except state 0 try to move right. For the leftmost column, moving down might be better. But I'm not sure because of the slippery nature.

Alternatively, maybe using a greedy approach where each state tries to go as close to the goal as possible. For example:

- From state 7 (top-right), moving down would lead towards the goal.
- From state 3, moving right or down might help reach state 7 or 4 respectively.
- I need to check which actions in each state are less likely to hit holes.

Another thing to consider is that some states have higher risks of falling into holes. For example, certain middle states might lead to a hole if the action taken isn't careful.

Given that all previous policies have low rewards, perhaps the current strategies aren't effective enough at avoiding holes and reaching the goal consistently. So, I should try a different approach where each state's policy is more carefully designed to navigate towards the goal while minimizing risk.

I might need to create a map of the grid and assign actions based on proximity to the goal, ensuring that there's a path that avoids known holes as much as possible.

But without knowing exactly which states are holes, I have to infer based on trajectories. For example, if an action from state i often leads to a dead end or getting stuck, I should avoid that action.

In this case, perhaps changing some of the actions in key states to different directions could help. Maybe set more states to move towards the right and down when possible.

Wait, looking at the previous best policies, many have params[0] as 1, which from state 0 leads to [left, down, right]. Left is bad, so maybe choosing action 2 for state 0 (which gives [up, right, down]) could be better. But up from state 0 is invalid, so it might stay in place.

Alternatively, perhaps setting params[0] as 3 would give [left, up, right], but again, left and up aren't helpful. So maybe action 1 is the best for state 0 because moving down has a chance to go towards state 4 or stay.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to try specific changes in certain states that might have been problematic in previous policies. For example, if many trajectories get stuck at state 4, perhaps changing params[4] from 0 to another action could help move further down.

Alternatively, maybe some of the middle states are leading into holes because their current actions aren't safe. So adjusting those actions to point towards safer directions might help.

Since all previous policies have low rewards, I think it's time to try a completely different configuration that hasn't been tried before. Maybe assign each state an action that is more directly aimed at the goal, considering the grid layout and avoiding holes based on possible transitions.

Perhaps making states in the top row move right or down, states in the bottom row move right, and middle states navigate towards the bottom-right corner.

I think I need to create a new policy where each state's action is carefully chosen to push towards 15 without getting stuck or falling into holes. Let me try setting specific actions for key states:

- State 0: Right (action 1) because moving right could take it closer.
- State 1: Down (action ?) Wait, need to check the possible moves.

Wait, each action corresponds to a set of three directions with equal probability. So I need to map which action leads to which movement options.

For example:

- Action 0 from any state: [down, left, up]
- Action 1: [right, down, left]
- Action 2: [up, right, down]
- Action 3: [left, up, right]

So for each state, choosing an action will give the agent a chance to move in one of three directions.

The goal is to reach state 15. So states should try to move towards it as much as possible.

Let me try creating a policy where:

- States on the top row (0-3) tend to move right or down.
- Middle rows (4-7, 8-11) move towards the bottom-right.
- Bottom row (12-15) moves right until reaching 15.

But I need to be careful with the slippery nature. For example:

- State 0: action 1 gives [right, down, left]. Right leads to state 1, down stays in state 0 (since from top-left, moving down would stay if it's a hole?), but no—state 4 is below 0.

Wait, the grid is 4x4. So state i is row i//4 and column i%4.

So:

- State 0: row 0, col 0
- Action 0 from 0: [down (to 4), left (invalid, maybe stays at 0?), up (invalid, stays)]
Wait no—probably when moving out of bounds, the agent stays. So action 0 from state 0 would move down to 4 with 1/3 chance, and stay in 0 for other moves.

But if it's a hole, then perhaps some states are holes. But I don't know which ones.

Alternatively, maybe assign each state an action that maximizes the chance of moving towards the goal without getting stuck.

For example:

- State 0: move right (action 1) to go to state 1
- State 1: move down or right
Wait, but with action 1 from state 1, it would try [right (to 2), down (to 5), left (to 0)].

Alternatively, maybe assign action 3 for some states because it allows movement in multiple directions that might help reach the goal.

I think I'm overcomplicating. Maybe look for a policy that's more aggressive towards moving right and down, as those are the general directions toward the goal.

Looking at previous policies, params[0] was often set to 1 or 2. Let me try setting it differently.

Wait, perhaps the best approach is to use a known optimal policy for FrozenLake. In standard FrozenLake (non-slippery), the optimal policy uses right and down actions. But in this slippery version, since each action has 3 possible moves, it's more complex.

I think that, given the slipperiness, a good strategy is to have states in the top row move right or down, middle rows move towards the bottom-right, and bottom rows move right until reaching 15.

So let me try setting:

- For states 0 (top-left), choose action that allows moving right or down. Action 1 from state 0 gives [right, down, left]. So 2/3 chance to move towards higher numbers (states 1 and 4). That's better than other actions.

- State 1: action 3, which gives [left, up, right]. But moving left or up might not be helpful. Alternatively, action 1 again, giving [right, down, left], so 2/3 chance to move towards state 2 or 5.

Wait, I'm getting confused about the direction mappings.

Alternatively, perhaps assign each state an action that has a higher chance of moving in the desired direction. For example:

- States in top row (0-3): choose actions that have right as one of the options.
- Middle states: choose actions that move towards bottom or right.
- Bottom states: move right until reaching 15.

But I'm not sure, so maybe I should look for a pattern.

Looking at previous policies, many had params[0] set to 1. Let me try changing some key states' actions to see if it improves the reward.

For example:

- Set state 7 (top-right) to action 3: [left, up, right]. But from state 7, moving down would be better, but action 2 from state 7 gives [up, right, down], so maybe action 2 is better for state 7 as it allows moving down.

Wait, I'm getting tangled in the direction mappings. Maybe a different approach: look at each state and decide which action's possible moves are most likely to lead towards the goal or avoid holes.

Alternatively, given that all previous policies have low rewards, perhaps the best is to try a new configuration where key states are set to move towards the goal more effectively.

Perhaps setting state 0 to action 1 (right), state 1 to action 3 (left/up/right but not sure), and so on. But without knowing which states are holes, it's hard to make precise decisions.

Wait, perhaps I can look at the trajectories provided in the top params. For example, one trajectory was (0,1) (4,2) (8,2). So from state 0 with action 1, moved down to 4. Then action 2 from 4 led to moving up, right, or down.

Wait, but that might have been a hole because the reward was low.

I think without knowing which states are holes, it's challenging, but perhaps I can infer based on trajectories.

In any case, given that all previous policies have low rewards, I should try a new configuration that hasn't been tried before. So maybe change several key states' actions to different values from what has been done so far.
