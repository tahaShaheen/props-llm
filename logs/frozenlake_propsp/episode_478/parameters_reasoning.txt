You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get to state 15, which gives a reward of +1, but there are holes that end the episode if stepped on. The agent's actions are slippery, meaning each action has a 33% chance to go in one of three directions.

Looking at the problem, I need to propose a policy (params array) that maximizes the reward. The user mentioned that the global optimal should be around 1.0, which is perfect because it means reaching the goal consistently.

The environment is 4x4 with states 0-15. From the trajectories provided, it looks like certain policies are leading to either falling into holes or getting stuck in loops. For example, some trajectories show repeated actions that don't progress towards the goal and end up in holes.

I need to ensure that each state's action choice avoids leading into known holes. The current top-performing params have an average reward of around 0.30, which is significantly below 1.0, so we're in the exploration phase since rewards are far from optimal.

Given that, I should propose a policy that explores new paths and avoids previously tried ones. Maybe changing some actions to different directions could help find a better path to state 15 without hitting holes.

Looking at the most recent params, they seem to have a lot of 0s and 3s. Perhaps switching some actions from 0 or 3 to another direction might lead to progress. For example, in state 0 (top-left), if it's currently set to action 1, maybe changing it to action 2 could push the agent towards state 1, which is adjacent.

I should also consider how each action affects the possible next states. Since actions are slippery, the chosen action needs to have a high probability of moving towards the goal in at least one direction. For instance, from state 0, choosing an action that can move right or down might be beneficial since those directions lead closer to the goal.

Another consideration is avoiding getting stuck in loops. Some policies seem to repeat states, leading to low rewards. So, I need to ensure that each state's action choice leads towards unexplored paths or directly towards the goal.

I think a good strategy would be to set actions for each state that have at least one direction leading straight towards the goal and avoids known holes. For example, from state 12 (bottom-left), moving right might lead to state 13, which could then move up to reach state 15.

In summary, I'll propose a new params array where some states switch their actions to explore different paths, aiming to find a trajectory that reaches the goal without hitting any holes. This should help increase the reward towards the optimal 1.0.
