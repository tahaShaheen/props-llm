You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Okay, I need to help find the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment using the given setup. Let's break down what we know and figure out a good approach.

First, the environment is a 4x4 grid where each state has specific actions with probabilities due to slippiness. The goal is to reach state 15, giving a reward of +1, while other states give 0. There are holes that end the episode if stepped on, so avoiding them is crucial.

The policy is represented by an array params[0] to params[15], each taking values from [0,1,2,3]. My task is to propose a new set of parameters in each iteration based on the feedback from previous attempts.

Looking at the provided data, all the top-performing policies have given an average reward around 0.15, which is much lower than the target of 1.0. This suggests that the current strategies are not effective enough, and exploration is still needed to find better paths.

The recent parameters tried mostly result in low rewards (around 0.10 or less), indicating that we might be stuck in suboptimal states or not reaching the goal effectively. It's likely that the agent is either falling into holes too often or getting stuck in loops without progressing towards state 15.

Given that we're at iteration 184, there are still many opportunities to explore different policies. Since the rewards haven't approached close to 1.0, I should focus on exploration rather than exploitation. This means proposing a new set of parameters that haven't been tried before to gather more information about which actions lead closer to the goal and avoid holes.

I'll consider changing some of the parameters in key positions, like states near the goal or those prone to falling into holes, to see if different actions can help navigate better. For example, perhaps certain states should be set to move right or down more often to reach state 15 without hitting any holes.

After evaluating possible changes and considering the grid layout, I'll propose a new params array that adjusts several states' actions. This will involve selecting actions for each state that could potentially lead towards the goal while minimizing the risk of falling into holes based on prior trajectories.
