You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get an episodic reward around 1.0, which means reaching state 15 without falling into any holes.

Looking at the top params provided earlier, most of them have rewards below 0.4, which suggests that we're not very close to the optimal solution yet. Since the rewards are far from 1.0, I should be in "Explorer" mode, meaning I need to try new configurations to gather more information.

The environment is slippery, so each action has a probability of moving in three directions. This makes it tricky because even if we choose an action, there's no guarantee where the agent will end up. Therefore, the policy needs to account for these probabilities and avoid actions that could lead to holes with high probability.

Looking at the trajectories provided, I notice that some policies get stuck or fall into loops, like the one where the trajectory is (0,3) repeated multiple times. This indicates that certain policies aren't making progress towards the goal and are instead getting trapped. To avoid this, we need a policy that encourages movement towards the goal while minimizing the risk of falling into holes.

The recent params provided have low rewards, so it's time to try something different. Maybe changing some actions from their current values could help explore new paths. For example, if state 0 is currently set to action 2 (right), but that leads to a hole sometimes, maybe switching to action 1 or 3 could provide a safer path.

I should consider the positions of the holes and ensure that the policy avoids actions that have a high chance of leading into them. Without knowing exactly where the holes are, I can infer based on the trajectories provided. For instance, if state 0 leads to state 4 (down) with some probability, but sometimes it goes left or up, which might be safer or riskier depending on the hole locations.

Another approach is to structure the policy so that as the agent moves closer to the goal (like moving right and down), they have a higher chance of reaching the end. So, for states near the bottom-right corner, like state 12, 13, 14, and 15, the actions should be directed towards moving right or down.

I'll go through each state and decide which action is most likely to move towards the goal while avoiding holes. For example, in state 0 (top-left), choosing action 1 (right, down, left) might help, but I need to check if that leads into a hole. Alternatively, action 2 (up, right, down) could also be considered.

In states where moving up or left isn't beneficial (like the top row beyond state 0), it's better to push towards the right and down directions. For example, in state 1, choosing action 3 (left, up, right) might not help because moving up is risky if that leads to a hole. So perhaps action 1 or 2 would be better.

I'll also consider states near the bottom-right corner. In state 14, choosing action 0 (down, left, up) might lead towards state 15, but since it's already at the bottom row, moving down isn't possible, so right is necessary. Therefore, in state 14, setting the action to 2 or 3 could help move right.

After analyzing all states and considering the slippery nature of the environment, I'll propose a new set of parameters that differ from the previous ones, focusing on actions that guide the agent towards the goal while avoiding holes as much as possible.
