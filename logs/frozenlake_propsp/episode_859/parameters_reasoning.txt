You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help optimize the policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right corner) while avoiding holes. The agent can move in four directions, but due to the slippery nature, each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability.

First, I need to understand the structure of the grid and the possible paths. The grid is 4x4, so states are numbered from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). Holes can be anywhere except the goal. From the previous trajectories, it seems that some holes are present in certain states because agents often fall into them.

Looking at the provided examples and top-performing policies, I notice that many of them have low rewards around 0.35 to 0.45. The optimal reward should be close to 1.0, so we need a policy that can reliably reach the goal without hitting any holes.

The recent attempts include some that either get stuck in loops or fall into holes early on. For example, one trajectory keeps moving left and ends up in a hole after a few steps. Another trajectory tries moving right but gets stuck near the top row.

I should consider which actions lead towards the goal from each state without stepping on known holes. The agent's next position is probabilistic, so the policy needs to choose actions that maximize the chance of reaching the goal while minimizing the risk of falling into a hole.

For instance, in state 0 (top-left), moving down or right might be safer. However, due to the slippery nature, each action has a 1/3 chance of going three directions. So, choosing an action that allows progress towards the goal despite some randomness is key.

I also need to look at the trajectories provided. The most recent ones show that certain policies are leading to immediate falls into holes or getting stuck in loops. Therefore, I should adjust those states' actions to avoid such outcomes.

Let me analyze each state's optimal action:

- State 0: Should move towards the goal (right or down). Previous attempts have used action 1 and 2 here.
- State 1: Moving right seems risky due to holes; maybe moving down is safer?
- State 2: Moving up or right could help, but need to avoid known holes.
- And so on for each state.

Since I'm supposed to propose a new set of params that are distinct from previous ones and maximize information gain, I'll focus on changing the actions in states where agents frequently fall into holes. For example, if moving right from state 1 often leads to a hole, maybe switching to another action would help.

Also, considering that the agent needs to head towards the goal (state 15), each state's policy should ideally move closer. So, for each state, I need to determine which action, when taken, statistically increases the chance of reaching state 15 without hitting a hole.

Given the current buffer shows that rewards are still low, I'm in "Explorer" mode, so I'll try varying actions to gather more information about which paths lead to success or failure.

I'll start by modifying some critical states. For example:

- State 0: Try action 1 (right) instead of previous ones.
- State 3: Maybe moving down is better than right if there's a hole in the right direction.
- Continue this analysis for each state, ensuring that actions are chosen to move towards the goal while avoiding holes.

After considering these factors, I'll propose a new set of params where key states have their actions adjusted based on the observed trajectories and the need to avoid known hazards.
