You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to optimize the policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) without falling into any holes. From the problem description, it seems that each action taken by the agent has a 33% chance of moving in three possible directions due to the slippery nature of the grid.

Looking at the provided data, the current best performing policies are yielding around 0.45 average reward over 20 episodes. That's below the target of 1.0, so I need to focus on exploring more effectively to find a better policy.

The top 5 params all seem to have similar structures, mostly choosing actions that might be avoiding holes but not efficiently moving towards state 15. For example, some are taking action 2 or 3 repeatedly, which could lead the agent to loop around without making progress.

In the most recent two policies, one got a reward of 0.00 and another 0.20. The trajectories show that in some cases, the agent is not moving towards the goal and might be getting stuck near holes or not progressing effectively.

Given that I'm supposed to act as an explorer since rewards are below 1.0, I need to propose a new set of params that's significantly different from what has been tried before. The idea is to maximize information gain by trying new configurations rather than tweaking existing ones.

I should consider changing the actions for states near the holes and towards the goal to encourage more direct paths. For example, in state 15, it's already the goal, so no action is needed there. But for other states, perhaps adjusting the primary action to push towards the right or down when possible could help.

Looking at the grid, the agent should generally move right and down to reach the goal. So, I might want to set actions that encourage moving towards state 15. For example, in state 0 (top-left), taking action 2 (which allows a chance to go up or right) might be better than other options.

I also need to ensure that the chosen actions don't lead the agent into holes. So, for each state, I should check which directions are safe and set the policy to prefer those actions.

After considering all this, I'll create a new params array where each state is assigned an action that primarily tries to move towards the goal while avoiding risky moves near holes.
