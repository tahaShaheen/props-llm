You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, I'm trying to help find the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment described. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) with a reward of +1, avoiding holes which end the episode.

First, I need to understand the environment setup. It's a 4x4 grid, so states 0-3 are the top row, 4-7 the second, 8-11 the third, and 12-15 the bottom row. The slippery nature means each action has three possible outcomes with equal probability. For example, choosing action 0 (left) might result in moving down, left, or up.

Looking at the policy parameters, each params[i] is an action from 0 to 3 that the agent takes when in state i. My task is to propose these actions optimally to maximize the reward.

The user mentioned that the global optimal reward should be around 1.0, which suggests we need a policy that almost always reaches the goal without falling into holes. However, since the environment is slippery, there's some uncertainty in movement, so planning deterministic policies might not work directly.

I've been given some previous parameters and their corresponding rewards. The top-performing ones have rewards around 0.35-0.45, which indicates there's room for improvement. Since the current best isn't close to 1.0, I'm in the exploration phase, trying different configurations to gather more information.

Looking at the recent parameters, most are either getting stuck or falling into holes, as their rewards are low (like 0.05 and 0.0). This suggests that the policies tried so far might not be effectively navigating towards the goal or avoiding hazards.

I need to think about how each state should behave. For example:

- State 15 is the goal; if reached, it's done.
- States adjacent to holes (like 5, 6, etc.) must avoid actions leading into them.
- The agent should generally move towards the right and down to reach state 15.

But because of the slippery nature, each action has a 33% chance of moving in three directions. So, the policy needs to choose actions that statistically increase the chances of reaching the goal without hitting a hole.

I might consider setting policies that guide the agent towards safer paths. For instance, in state 0 (top-left), choosing an action that tends right or down could help move towards the goal. But I have to make sure that these choices don't lead into holes with high probability.

Looking at the recent trajectories, some agents get stuck in loops, like moving between states without making progress. To avoid this, perhaps adjusting certain states' actions can break these cycles.

I should also consider whether any patterns emerge from the previous parameters. For example, if many policies have params[0] as 1 or 2 (right or up), maybe trying a different action here could help. Alternatively, setting state 4 (top-middle) to move right might push towards the goal.

Another approach is to simulate the movement probabilities for each state's actions and choose the ones that statistically lead closer to the goal while avoiding holes. This would involve calculating expected rewards based on possible transitions.

Given that I'm in exploration mode, I should propose a new set of parameters that are different from previous attempts but still logical. For example, setting certain states to always move right or down might help navigate towards the goal more effectively.

After considering all this, I'll draft a new set of params, ensuring each is chosen from [0,1,2,3], and avoid repeating any configurations seen before.
