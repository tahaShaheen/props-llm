You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help optimize the policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with as high a reward as possible, avoiding the holes. The environment is slippery, which adds some uncertainty because each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability.

First, I need to understand the structure of the problem. It's a 4x4 grid, so states are numbered from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). Each state has a policy parameter that determines the action taken when in that state. The actions are 0: down/left/up, 1: right/down/left, 2: up/right/down, and 3: left/up/right.

The challenge is that each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability, so it's not straightforward. The agent needs a policy that maximizes the chance of reaching state 15 without falling into any holes.

Looking at the provided top 5 best performing params, I notice that some states are choosing actions that might be leading towards the goal but sometimes get stuck or fall into holes. For example, in the first param set, the trajectory goes (0,1) to (4,2) to (8,2). That's moving down and then further down, which seems risky because it might lead to a hole.

In another top param, the trajectory is (0,3), which immediately moves right. But in some cases, that leads to getting stuck or falling into a hole. So I need to think about what actions are safe and lead towards the goal.

The recent params show low rewards, like 0.00, 0.10, etc., which suggests that the current policies aren't performing well enough. The highest reward in top params is 0.45, which is below the target of 1.0. So we need to explore better policies.

I should consider how each state's policy affects the overall trajectory. For example, state 0 (top-left) can choose actions that move towards state 3 or 4 or 1. But because the environment is slippery, it might end up in other states. Similarly, state 15 is the goal; once reached, the episode ends with a reward of +1.

I think I need to look for policies where each state's action increases the likelihood of moving towards the goal without getting stuck. For example, from state 0, choosing an action that has a higher probability of moving right or down might be better because those directions lead closer to the goal.

Wait, but in this slippery environment, even if you choose 'right' (action 1), there's a chance it moves left, down, or right. So we need policies where each state's action choices guide towards the goal despite the possible random movements.

Looking at the recent params, I see some patterns like all states having a specific action that might not be optimal. For instance, in one of the recent params, many states are set to 0, which might not be the best approach because it could lead them down or left, depending on where they are.

I should try to vary the actions more and see if there's a combination that consistently navigates towards state 15 without getting into holes. Maybe from certain states, choosing specific actions can help avoid holes even when the movement is random.

Another approach is to look for policies that allow the agent to explore different paths but prioritize moving towards the goal. For example, in state 7 (which is the top-right of the second row), choosing an action that tends to move right or down might be better because it's closer to the goal.

I should also consider that some states have higher risk of falling into holes, so their policies must choose actions carefully to avoid those. For example, if a state is adjacent to a hole, the policy should avoid actions that could lead towards it even with the slippery nature.

Given all this, I think a good strategy would be to set each state's action to one that has the highest chance of moving towards the goal while avoiding dangerous paths. However, since the movement is probabilistic, we need policies that cover all possible outcomes without leading into holes.

Perhaps experimenting with different combinations where some states have specific actions and others vary could help. For example, in the starting state (0), choosing action 1 (right) might be beneficial because it can move towards state 3 or stay in state 0 or move to state 4. But I need to see how this plays out in different trajectories.

I should also look at the trajectories provided and see where the agent is failing. For example, one trajectory goes (0,1) (4,2) (8,2), which might be getting too far down and not making progress towards the goal. Another trajectory ends quickly by falling into a hole, indicating that some policies are taking unnecessary risks.

Overall, I think the next step is to propose a policy where each state's action is chosen to maximize the chance of moving towards the goal, considering all possible outcomes, while avoiding actions that could lead into holes.
