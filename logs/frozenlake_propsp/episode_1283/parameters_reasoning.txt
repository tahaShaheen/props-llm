You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help optimize the policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right corner) and avoid the holes. From what I understand, each action has a 33% chance of moving in three possible directions due to the slippery nature of the grid.

Looking at the problem, I need to propose a new set of parameters for the policy. The best performing policies so far have an average reward around 0.45, which is significantly below the target of 1.0. This suggests that we're still in the exploration phase because the rewards aren't close enough to optimal.

I remember that the environment has holes, and the agent must learn which states are safe by exploring trajectories. The provided examples show that certain policies lead to getting stuck or falling into holes quickly. For instance, some recent trials ended with the agent stepping on state 4 or others, resulting in low rewards.

To explore further, I need to propose a new policy that's different from what's been tried before. Maybe adjusting actions for key states could help. For example, if certain states are leading to dead-ends, changing their action might allow the agent to take a different path and avoid holes or reach the goal more efficiently.

Looking at the current top policies, they seem to have similar patterns in some states. Perhaps by tweaking specific states' actions, I can create a policy that navigates around the holes better. For instance, changing the action for state 0 from 1 to something else might alter the trajectory and help avoid early failures.

I should also consider the structure of the grid. The agent starts at state 0 (top-left). To reach state 15, it needs a path that doesn't cross any holes. Maybe prioritizing right or down movements could be beneficial, but due to slipperiness, it's not straightforward.

Another approach is to ensure that each state's action maximizes the chance of moving towards the goal while minimizing the risk of falling into holes. For example, in states where moving right might lead to a hole, choosing an alternative action like down or up could prevent failure.

I think I'll propose a policy where key starting states have different actions. Maybe setting params[0] to 2 instead of 1 could make the agent try moving up more, but considering the grid's layout, that might not be useful. Alternatively, changing some middle states' actions to encourage movement towards the goal without stepping on holes.

I need to ensure each proposed parameter is unique and hasn't been tried before. Looking back at previous params, I can see some patterns, so I'll shuffle a few key parameters to gather new information about which paths are safe or lead closer to the goal.
