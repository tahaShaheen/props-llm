You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let's see what I know. The grid is 4x4, and the agent can move in four directions, but because it's slippery, each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability.

The goal is state 15 (bottom right corner), which gives +1 reward. All other states give 0 except for the holes, which end the episode immediately. The policy is an array of 16 actions (each from 0-3) that map each state to an action.

Looking at the history provided, I see several previous params and their rewards. The best so far has a reward of 0.35, which is way below the target of 1.0. So, clearly, we need to improve this.

The key here is to figure out the optimal path from any given state to reach state 15 without falling into any holes. Since the environment is slippery, the agent's chosen action doesn't directly lead to a specific next state but instead has multiple possibilities. Therefore, the policy should be designed in such a way that it maximizes the chance of eventually reaching state 15 while avoiding the holes.

From the trajectories provided, I notice that some policies are leading the agent into loops or not making progress towards the goal. For example, one trajectory went from (0,3) to (1,3) multiple times without moving forward. So, perhaps we need to adjust the policy in certain states to avoid such behaviors.

Looking at state 0 (top-left corner), if the agent takes action 1, it can move right, down, or left. But since being in state 0's neighboring states might be near a hole, I should choose an action that has the highest probability of moving towards the goal without risking falling into a hole.

Similarly, for state 15, which is the goal, perhaps we don't need to do anything because once reached, the episode ends. So, any state leading to 15 needs to have actions that increase the chances of getting there.

I also notice that in some previous policies, certain states (like state 8) might be taking actions that send them back or not towards the goal. Adjusting these could help improve the reward.

Given all this, I think we need to strategically tweak the policy to ensure that from each state, the chosen action has a higher chance of moving closer to state 15 and avoids holes. Since the agent can't remember previous attempts (stateless), each suggestion should aim to explore or exploit based on current information.

Looking at the recent params provided, perhaps we need to change some actions in states that are leading into non-productive paths. For instance, if a certain action in state 4 isn't moving towards the goal efficiently, changing it could help.

So, I'll propose a new set of params where each state's action is carefully chosen based on possible moves that avoid holes and increase the likelihood of reaching the goal. This might involve selecting actions that move the agent right or down more often in certain states, depending on their position.

I should also ensure that this new set of params hasn't been tried before to maximize information gain as per the strategy mentioned. By doing so, we can explore new territories and potentially find a better reward.
