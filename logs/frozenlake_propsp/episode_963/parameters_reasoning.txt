You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, let's try to figure out the best next step for this problem. I'm a bit new to RL and FrozenLake environments, so I'll take it step by step.

First, understanding the environment is crucial. It's a 4x4 grid with state numbers from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). The goal is to reach state 15 for a reward of +1, while all other states give 0. The slippery nature means each action has three possible outcomes, making the environment stochastic.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 actions, each corresponding to a state from 0 to 15. Each element can be 0, 1, 2, or 3, representing different movement directions. However, because of the slipperiness, choosing an action doesn't guarantee moving in that direction; instead, there's a 1/3 chance for each of three possible moves.

Looking at the provided data, the best performing policies have average rewards around 0.45 to 0.35. The goal is to get close to 1.0, so we're not yet optimal.

The recent trajectories show that many attempts are getting stuck or falling into holes, as seen in the trajectories where agents keep moving without reaching the goal. For example, one trajectory shows repeated stays at (0,0) and then jumping to (4,0), which might be due to a hole.

To improve, I need to think about how each state's action choice affects the probability of avoiding holes and reaching the goal. Let's consider some key states:

1. **Start State (0)**: Choosing an action that moves towards the right or down is better because moving left isn't possible from the top-left corner. Maybe action 1 (right, down, left) could help move right more often.

2. **Holes**: The trajectories mention holes at certain states. For example, state 4 might have a hole since an agent stepping there didn't proceed further. Similarly, other states like 5 or 6 might be risky. So, the policy should avoid actions that lead to these holes.

3. **Goal State (15)**: Once reached, the goal gives +1. To maximize this, we need policies that ensure a high probability of reaching state 15 without falling into holes.

Looking at previous params, most have action 3 in some states, which is associated with [left, up, right]. Maybe adjusting these to prioritize certain directions more can help avoid holes and reach the goal faster.

Given that recent rewards are low (0.20 or lower), we should focus on exploration rather than exploitation since the current policies aren't close enough to optimal. So, the next step is to propose a new set of params that explores different paths, avoiding previously tested configurations to gather more information about which states lead to success or failure.

I'll consider changing some actions in key states like 0, 4, 5, etc., to see if they can avoid holes and reach the goal more effectively. For example, setting state 0 to action 1 (which allows moving right) instead of previous choices might help move towards the goal without getting stuck.

After considering these points, I'll propose a new set of params that slightly varies from the current top performers, focusing on states near the edges and ensuring actions that guide towards the goal while avoiding known risky moves.
