You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment where it's slippery and has holes that require exploration beyond just the known states. The policy is represented by an array of parameters, each corresponding to a state in the grid. Each parameter can take values from 0 to 3.

First, I remember that the goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right corner) with the highest reward. Other states give zero reward. However, there are holes that could end the game if stepped on, so exploration is necessary beyond just the known paths.

The policy values params[i] for each state i, and the value of params[0], params[1], etc., determine the action taken from that state. The challenge here is to find parameters that avoid getting stuck in these holes while maximizing rewards through exploring them.

Looking at the provided examples, some configurations result in a reward around 0.25, but others are lower. For instance, some have higher rewards like 1.0. However, all seem below what's expected for global optimality since they're just local maxima.

I should consider that each parameter choice affects future actions. Since each action leads to different probabilities of taking certain directions, I need a balance where certain parameters encourage exploration in the hole areas while still moving towards the goal states with higher rewards.

Maybe I can start by testing some corner cases. For example, if params[0] is 3, that would mean from state 0, all actions have equal probability except for action 0 (down). Wait, no—params[i] directly correspond to the action when in state i. So if params[0] is 3, from state 0, you always take action 3 (right), avoiding the hole.

But if I set params[0] to 1, which means taking action 1 (right), down, or left with equal probability. Since the top row has a hole there, this could force the agent into moving right, avoiding it unless it steps onto it again. Hmm, not sure that's optimal for exploring.

Alternatively, setting params[0] to 2 might mean taking up, which is away from the goal. Maybe if I can avoid stepping on the holes, but sometimes moving towards the hole could be necessary for exploration.

I think a good approach would involve testing different parameter combinations around what we see in the examples. For instance, maybe setting params[0] to 2 and others to 3 or similar might encourage some movement away from holes while still exploring areas near them.

But without trying all possibilities, it's hard to know for sure. Maybe I can set a few parameters high (like 3) to avoid certain states, ensuring the agent explores those areas more thoroughly. Others could be set to lower values to guide towards known paths.

Another thought: since some policies have f(params) around 0.25 and others around 0.1, maybe starting with params that have higher values in areas where holes are possible (like params[6] being 3 or 2 for state 6), but also ensuring the agent can still reach the goal.

I should probably try to set certain parameters high enough to avoid getting stuck on the holes, while others guide toward the goal. Maybe a mix of higher and lower values around what's seen in the examples would help find a better reward.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps instead of tweaking specific parameters, I can consider that each parameter affects future transitions. So, by adjusting params[i], I influence how likely the agent is to explore neighboring states or move into areas with holes.

In the end, since the optimal reward isn't known yet and exploration is needed beyond what's obvious, perhaps a combination where some parameters are set in a way that encourages movement away from holes while others guide towards the goal. Maybe setting params[0] as 3 (avoiding hole), others as 2 or 1 for exploration but still keeping them near the goal.

I think I'll try something like params[0]: 3, params[1]: 2, params[2]: 3, and other states as 2. This might balance exploration in areas with holes while trying to reach the goal.
