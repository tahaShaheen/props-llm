You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get the agent to state 15 with the highest possible reward, avoiding holes along the way. Since the environment is slippery, each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability.

First, I need to understand the grid layout. It's a 4x4 grid where each state represents a specific cell. The top-left corner is state 0, and it goes row-wise down to state 15 at the bottom-right. Some states are holes, which end the episode immediately with no reward.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 numbers (params), each corresponding to a state, indicating the action to take when in that state. The actions are 0, 1, 2, or 3, each leading to three possible moves as described.

Looking at the provided examples and trajectories, I see that some policies have low rewards, suggesting they're not effective. For instance, policies that keep looping in the same area without progressing towards the goal (like staying on state 0) yield very low rewards.

Since we're aiming for a global optimal reward around 1.0, which means reaching the goal consistently, I need to design a policy that navigates effectively while avoiding holes.

The current best policies have an average reward of about 0.30, which is far below the target. This suggests that the agent is still falling into holes or not reaching the goal often enough. To improve this, I should focus on exploring new policies that can navigate more efficiently and avoid previously problematic paths.

One approach is to make sure that from each state, the chosen action has a higher probability of moving towards the goal (state 15) while minimizing the chance of stepping into holes. Since the environment is slippery, each action has three possible outcomes, so it's crucial to choose actions that maximize the likelihood of progressing towards the goal.

For example, in the starting state (0), choosing an action that generally moves right or down would be beneficial. However, considering the slipperiness, I need to select actions that have a higher chance of moving the agent closer to the goal without leading it into holes.

Looking at the previous attempts, some policies lead the agent towards state 4, which is in the second row. From there, choosing an action that moves down or right could be better. Similarly, states near the bottom-right should have actions that aim directly for state 15.

I also notice that some trajectories loop endlessly without making progress, so it's essential to avoid policies that result in such loops. Instead, each step should ideally bring the agent closer to the goal or at least not increase the distance.

Considering all this, I'll propose a new set of parameters where each state is assigned an action that primarily aims towards the goal while also considering possible detours to avoid holes. For example, from state 0, choosing right (action 1) might lead towards states that are closer to the goal without immediately risking falling into a hole.

I'll structure the policy so that states in the top-left have actions pointing towards the right or down, and as we move towards the bottom-right, the actions become more direct towards state 15. This should help increase the chances of reaching the goal while reducing the risk of hitting holes.

After analyzing possible trajectories and considering the slippery nature of the environment, I'll assign specific actions to each state that balance exploration with exploitation, ensuring a higher probability of success in reaching the goal.
