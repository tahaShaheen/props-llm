You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to find the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right corner) with the highest reward possible. Each action taken has a certain probability of choosing another direction. If the agent chooses an action that leads into a hole, it gets stuck there.

First, I need to understand how the policy works. The policy is represented by params[0] to params[15], each indicating which action (0-3) to take from each state. Each action has equal probability when chosen, except for some specific cases where certain actions are more likely.

Looking at the examples provided, I see various combinations of parameters that result in different rewards. The best reward is 1.00, achieved by some parameter settings. However, other parameters can also yield good results but aren't as optimal.

I think about how each action affects the agent's position. For example, taking action 3 (left) might get the agent stuck if it tries to move left from state 2 or 15. But using action 2 (up) gives a higher chance of moving up, which might be better than other actions.

I also notice that certain states have more opportunities to explore. For instance, the top-left corner (0) can move down, left, or up equally likely. If I take action 3 from state 0, the agent goes up but might not be safe. However, using a parameter that allows some randomness here could prevent getting stuck.

I'm considering the possibility of mixing actions to avoid immediate holes. Maybe taking action 2 (up) from certain states gives better exploration without risking being trapped.

Looking at the examples again, params[0] being 3 and others varying seem to offer different degrees of risk in starting positions. It might be that balancing between safer moves helps in exploring more and finding the optimal path.

I also need to think about the discount factor, but it's mentioned as the same for all steps. Since the rewards are non-negative, a high enough discount factor (like 1) is important, but since it's not provided, I assume it's already set optimally.

Finally, considering that some parameters lead to higher rewards while others might be better in terms of exploration, I think the optimal policy would involve varying these actions cautiously from dangerous areas and taking more chances where it's safer.
