You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the goal is to find the globally optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment described. The environment is a 4x4 grid with specific slippery actions and holes that end the episode if stepped on.

First, I need to understand the setup:

- The agent can move in four directions (left, down, right, up), but due to slipperiness, each action leads to three possible next states with equal probability.
- The goal is state 15 (bottom-right corner) which gives +1 reward. All other states give 0 except for holes which end the episode.
- The policy is a function that maps each of the 16 states to one of four actions.

The problem requires proposing a new set of parameters (params[0] to params[15]) at each iteration, with the goal of maximizing the episodic reward averaged over 20 episodes. 

Given that I'm supposed to act as a stateless optimizer, I can't remember previous proposals or results except what's provided in the buffer. My task is to maximize information gain by either exploring new parameter configurations or optimizing around the best ones if we're close to the optimal reward.

Looking at the provided data:

- The top 5 best performing params have an average reward of ~0.35, which is below the target of 1.0. This suggests that our current policies aren't achieving the goal consistently.
- The most recent two params performed worse (0.05 and 0.0), indicating possible exploration into less effective strategies or perhaps getting stuck.

Since the rewards are still significantly below 1.0, I should adopt an exploratory approach to find new configurations that might lead to better performance. However, I also need to ensure that the parameters don't cause the agent to fall into holes.

To do this, I'll consider:

1. **Exploring New Policies**: Since previous attempts haven't reached the target, it's crucial to try out different policies to gather more information about which actions lead to success or failure.
2. **Avoiding Holes**: The policy must ensure that from any state, the chosen action doesn't have a high probability of leading into a hole. This might involve selecting actions that move towards safe directions or away from known holes.
3. **Targeting State 15**: The optimal path should navigate towards the goal (state 15) while avoiding traps. Given the slippery nature, it's essential to plan paths that have high probabilities of reaching the goal without falling into holes.

Looking at state 0 (top-left corner), I might choose actions that move right or down, as these are more likely to progress towards the goal. However, due to slipperiness, each action has a 1/3 chance of moving in three directions, so careful selection is needed.

I'll propose a new set of parameters where each state's action is chosen to either move directly towards the goal or stay within safe zones, minimizing the risk of falling into holes. For example:

- State 0: Choose right (action 1) as it can lead towards state 3 or down to state 4.
- State 15: Stay there since it's the goal; no action needed.

I'll need to define each state's optimal action based on proximity to the goal and avoiding holes. This requires mapping out possible safe paths and ensuring that each state's policy leads towards those paths with minimal risk.

After considering all states and their potential transitions, I'll construct a new params array that maximizes the chance of reaching state 15 without falling into any holes. This should involve actions that guide the agent towards the goal while accounting for the slippery nature of movement.
