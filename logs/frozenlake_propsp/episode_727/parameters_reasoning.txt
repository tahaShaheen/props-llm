You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me first understand the problem setup.

The environment is a 4x4 grid, and each state corresponds to a number from 0 to 15. The agent can move in four directions: up, down, left, right. But because it's slippery, when the agent takes an action, it has a 33% chance of going in one of three possible directions. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) for a reward of +1; all other states give 0. There are holes that end the episode if stepped on.

The policy is defined by an array 'params' where each element corresponds to the action taken in that state. My task is to propose different 'params' configurations, aiming to maximize the episodic reward. The maximum number of iterations allowed is 5000, and I need to ensure each proposal is unique to avoid repetition.

Looking at the provided information, the top-performing policies have average rewards around 0.45 or lower. This suggests that the optimal policy (which should reach around 1.0) hasn't been found yet because none of the proposed params are achieving consistent success.

I need to consider how each state's action choice can lead towards the goal without falling into holes. For example, states near the bottom-right should prioritize moving right or down. Also, considering the slippery nature, it's better to have actions that gradually move towards the goal with redundancy, so even if some steps are wrong, the agent can still progress.

Looking at the recent params suggested, they often have certain patterns but aren't consistently leading to the goal. I should explore different strategies for key states, especially those near the edges and in the middle.

One approach is to set up policies that push towards state 15 from all directions. For instance, states on the top row (0-3) might prioritize moving down. Middle states could alternate between right and down depending on their position. Also, ensuring that when the agent is near the goal, it's more likely to move in directions that can reach it.

I should also avoid actions that lead into holes by examining the trajectories provided. For example, if a policy leads to a hole after a few steps, I need to adjust those state-action pairs to prevent such outcomes.

Given that the current best is around 0.45, which is lower than optimal, perhaps more aggressive movement towards the goal with careful consideration of slippery probabilities could help. Maybe certain states should always move in one direction, while others alternate between two to cover more ground.

I need to propose a 'params' array where each state's action is chosen to maximize the chance of reaching 15 without falling into holes. Let me think about each state individually:

- State 0 (top-left corner): Possible actions that can move down or right. Given slipping, maybe choosing actions that cover both directions.
- States near edges: Actions should push towards the goal while avoiding stepping off the grid.

After considering all this, I'll propose a new 'params' configuration that differs from previous ones, focusing on states that haven't been successful yet and ensuring they guide the agent closer to state 15.
