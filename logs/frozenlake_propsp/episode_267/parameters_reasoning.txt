You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The problem is a bit tricky because of the slippery action dynamics and the presence of holes that require exploring through them.

First, let me understand the environment better. The state space is 4x4 grids, numbered from 0 to 15. Each state can lead to four possible actions: left (L), down (D), right (R), up (U). However, due to the slippery nature of the action, each action has a probability of 0.333... when taken.

The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) with a reward of +1 for each step. All other states give 0 reward. There are holes that can end the game if stepped onto. The agent should explore through these holes by reading history, which means it needs to try different paths and learn from each trajectory.

The policy is represented as an array of 16 values, where each value corresponds to a state (from 0 to 15). These values determine the action to take when in that state. The current parameter values are set to [1.0], but we need to find the best parameters from [0, 1, 2, 3].

The goal is to maximize the episodic reward over iterations, aiming for a high reward without getting stuck in local optima. Exploration should occur through previously explored trajectories.

Since the policy parameters are integers between 0 and 3, we can evaluate all possible combinations of these values as parameters for the states. Each parameter represents an action taken from that state, so there are 4^16 possible policies. That's a lot, but perhaps manageable with some heuristic or optimization method.

To approach this, I need to simulate the agent's behavior using different parameter values and track the episodic reward at each iteration. This will allow me to find which parameters yield the highest reward over time.

I can implement a simulation where for each parameter value in [0,1,2,3], assign each state to an action. Then run the agent through the environment multiple times with these parameters, keeping track of the total reward obtained. After several iterations (like 400), compare the rewards from different parameter sets.

From the provided examples, some parameters yield a reward of around 1.0, while others give lower rewards or worse paths that end the game prematurely. The optimal reward should ideally be as high as possible without getting stuck in holes.

I should also consider the dynamics where each action is taken with equal probability when certain actions lead to movement and other times to stay in place. This means for each state, the next state is determined by moving left, right, up, or down with 1/3 chance each, plus possibly staying in place if none of those directions are possible (like on the top row where 'up' would take it back).

To implement this, I'll set up a function to compute the next state based on the current state and action. For each parameter value, generate the policy by mapping states to actions. Then run the simulation for multiple iterations, calculating the episodic reward each time.

After running several hundred iterations with different parameter sets, select the one that consistently provides the highest reward. This should lead us toward the global optimal policy.

I also need to ensure that we explore all possible paths through holes by revisiting states with different policies over time. Since the goal is to reach state 15, the agent will likely take various paths before converging on an optimal strategy.

Potential challenges include ensuring enough exploration to avoid getting stuck in local optima and efficiently managing computational resources while running multiple simulations for each parameter set. But given that we have limited iterations (400), it's manageable with proper setup.
