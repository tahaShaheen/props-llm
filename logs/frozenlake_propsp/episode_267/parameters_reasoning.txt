You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me break down what's given and figure out how to approach it.

First, the environment is a 4x4 grid with states numbered from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). The goal is state 15, which gives a reward of +1. All other states give 0, except for the holes that end the episode immediately upon stepping on them.

The policy is a function mapping each state (0-15) to an action (0-3), and it's represented as an array called params. The challenge is to determine this array such that the agent maximizes its reward by reaching the goal while avoiding holes.

Given that the environment is slippery, each action taken results in moving in one of three directions with equal probability. So, for example, taking action 0 (left) might result in down, left, or up.

The key here is to find a policy where the agent can navigate from any starting state to the goal (15) while avoiding the holes. Since the environment is slippery, we need a policy that accounts for these probabilities and reduces the chances of falling into holes.

Looking at the top 6 best-performing params provided earlier, I notice that many have f(params) around 0.15-0.25, which is quite low. The goal is to get close to 1.0, so clearly there's room for improvement.

The recent attempts show even lower rewards, some as low as 0.00. This suggests that the current policies are not effectively navigating towards the goal or are falling into holes too often.

Given that I'm supposed to act as a stateless optimizer, my strategy is to maximize information gain by choosing params that explore new configurations if rewards are far from optimal and tweak existing good ones when close. Since the rewards so far are low, I should focus on exploring different policies rather than exploiting current near-optimal ones.

I need to propose a new set of params that haven't been tried before. Let's think about how each state can move towards the goal with minimal risk.

Looking at the grid:

- State 0 (top-left) needs to get to state 15, which is bottom-right. So it should aim to go down or right. But since actions are slippery, moving down or right might not always work, so the policy for state 0 should choose an action that has a higher chance of getting closer.

- Similarly, states in the top row (0-3) can only move down initially because moving up isn't possible without falling into a hole. So their policies should be set to actions that encourage downward or rightward movement towards the goal.

I think setting state 0's action to 2 (which is 'up', but wait, no—action definitions are specific). Let me check:

- Action 0: [down, left, up]
- Action 1: [right, down, left]
- Action 2: [up, right, down]
- Action 3: [left, up, right]

So for state 0 (top-left), to move towards the goal, it's better to try moving down or right. Let's see which action would give a higher probability of those directions.

Action 1 from state 0 gives possible moves right, down, left. Since being in top-left, moving left is not useful as it might go out of bounds or into a hole. So action 1 could be better because right and down are towards the goal.

Wait, but according to the environment description, when taking an action, you have equal probability among the three possible directions for that action. So for state 0:

- Action 0: [down, left, up]. Up would take it out of bounds (since it's top-left), so perhaps in reality, up might not be a valid move and could result in staying or some other behavior. But according to the problem statement, it just goes into those directions with equal probability regardless.

But since the environment is slippery, any action taken can lead to one of three possible moves. So for state 0:

- Taking action 1 (right, down, left) would have a chance to move right or down, which are towards the goal, whereas taking action 0 might move down or left, which could be better.

Wait, but moving down from state 0 leads to state 4, which is in the next row. So for state 0, perhaps choosing action 1 (right) would give a higher chance of moving right towards the goal.

Similarly, for other states near the top-left, we need to choose actions that have the highest probability of moving towards the goal without hitting holes.

But since I don't know where the holes are exactly, but based on the trajectories provided, some attempts fell into holes. So, for example, in one trajectory, (0,1) went to state 4, which is row 2, column 0. If that's a hole, then certain actions should be avoided.

Wait, looking at the trajectories:

- One trajectory was (0,3) leading to (1,3), etc., suggesting that state 0,3 might not be a hole but perhaps state 14 or others are.

But without knowing the exact locations of holes, I have to make assumptions based on the trajectories and how they ended.

Another approach is to create a policy where each state's action encourages movement towards the goal (state 15), considering all possible slippery outcomes.

For instance:

- States in row 0 should try to move down or right.
- States in column 3 (rightmost) can't move further right, so their actions should be to move down.
- Similarly, states near the bottom should focus on moving right if possible.

But since the environment is slippery, each action has a chance to go in three directions. So perhaps choosing actions that have a higher probability of moving towards the goal would be better.

For example:

- For state 0 (top-left), taking action 1 (right, down, left) gives a 2/3 chance to move right or down.
- Taking action 0 (down, left, up) gives 1/3 chance to go down and 1/3 left, which is bad.

So maybe state 0 should choose action 1.

Similarly:

- State 1: in top-middle. Action 1 would let it move right (to state 2), down (state 5), or left (state 0). Moving right towards the goal is better.

But I need to make sure that these movements don't lead into holes.

Alternatively, perhaps a more systematic approach:

Let me try to outline what each state should do to reach 15 without hitting holes.

Assuming the holes are in states other than the goal and start positions, let's try to build a path towards the goal.

One possible optimal policy is to move right when possible, but considering the slippery nature.

Wait, but since movement is probabilistic, the agent needs a policy that gives the highest chance of eventually reaching state 15 without hitting any holes.

But without knowing where the holes are, it's challenging. However, based on trajectories, some paths led to falling into holes or not.

Looking at one trajectory:

- (0,3) (0,3) (0,3)... suggests that taking action 2 from state 0 might lead to staying in place, which is bad if the hole is there.

Alternatively, another approach: try to create a policy where each state moves towards increasing row and column numbers as much as possible.

So for state i:

- If moving right is possible without hitting a hole, choose that.
- Else, move down.

But since it's slippery, we need to account for probabilities.

Wait, perhaps setting up the policy so that from each state, the action chosen has the highest chance of increasing either row or column towards 15.

Alternatively, perhaps using BFS to find shortest paths from each state to the goal, considering possible transitions due to slipping.

But without knowing the exact hole positions, this is tricky. So I have to make an educated guess based on the trajectories and previous attempts.

Looking at one of the best-performing params:

params[0]: 2; params[1]: 3; ... which had f(params) = 0.25.

Trajectory was (0,1), (4,2), (8,2).

So from state 0, action 1 leads to state 4, then action 2 leads to state 8, and so on. So this seems like a path moving down and right.

Another attempt with params[0]: 3; ... had f(params) = 0.00. The trajectory ended at (0,0), suggesting it didn't move properly or fell into a hole.

Given that, perhaps state 0's action should be set to 1 (right) as that seems to have worked in the top-performing case.

Similarly, for other states:

- State 4: located at row 2, column 0. To get closer to the goal, it should move right or down.
Looking at the top-performing params, state 4's action was set to 1 (from earlier data), which would allow moving right (to state 5) or down (state 8). That seems reasonable.

Continuing this way for each state, ensuring that actions are chosen to maximize progress towards the goal while avoiding holes.

Given all that, I'll propose a new set of params where each state is set to an action that best increases its row or column number towards the goal. For example:

- States in top row (0-3) should move down.
- Middle rows: move right if possible, else down.
- Rightmost column: move down until reaching the bottom, then right.

But considering the slippery nature, I'll choose actions that have a higher chance of moving towards the goal.

For state 0: action 1 (right or down)
State 1: action 3 (left, up, right). Wait, action 3's moves are left, up, right. From state 1, moving right is better.

Wait, no, state 1 is at row 0, column 1. Action 3 would allow moving left (state 0), up (invalid), or right (state 2). So from state 1, action 3 gives a higher chance to move right towards the goal.

Similarly for other states:

Let me try to assign actions based on that logic.

But since I can't know the hole positions, I have to make an assumption. Perhaps setting each state to choose the action that has the highest probability of moving towards the goal.

Alternatively, considering that in the top-performing params, state 0 was set to 2 and had a reward of 0.25. So maybe that's a good starting point, but I need to vary it to explore more.

Wait, another thought: since all previous policies have low rewards, perhaps my current approach isn't working. Maybe the holes are making certain paths unsafe, so the policy needs to be more cautious.

Alternatively, perhaps using a value iteration approach to find the optimal Q-values, then derive the policy from that. But without knowing hole positions, it's difficult.

Given all this, I'll propose a new set of params where each state is assigned an action that has the highest chance of moving towards the goal, avoiding actions that could lead into holes based on previous trajectories.

For example:

- State 0: action 1 (right or down)
- State 1: action 3 (right)
- States in row 0 and column <3: action 1 or 3 to move right
- Middle rows: action 2 or 3 to move right or down
- Rightmost states: action 0 or 1 to move down

But I need to assign specific actions. Let's try:

params[0] = 1 (right)
params[1] = 3 (right)
params[2] = 1 (down)
params[3] = 3 (right)
...
Wait, but without knowing the hole positions, it's hard to ensure safety.

Alternatively, looking at the top-performing params where state 0 was set to 2 and had a reward of 0.25, maybe I should vary that.

Perhaps setting state 0 to action 1 instead, and see if that trajectory is better.

But given that the previous attempts with various actions have low rewards, perhaps a different approach is needed.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps using a policy where each state moves down as much as possible. For example:

- States in row <3: action 0 (down)
- Except for the rightmost column, which can't move further right and should move down.

But considering that action 0 from state 0 leads to moving left or up as well, which are bad. So maybe action 1 is better for state 0.

Alternatively, perhaps using a more randomized approach in the initial states to explore different paths.

Given all this confusion, I think the best way is to propose a new set of params where each state is assigned an action that encourages movement towards the goal without repeating previous attempts. For example:

params[0] = 1
params[1] = 3
params[2] = 1
...
But I need to assign all 16 states.

Alternatively, perhaps setting all states in row 0 and column <3 to action 1 (right or down), and others accordingly.

Wait, but without a clear map of the holes, it's hard. So maybe choosing a policy that's different from previous ones, like varying some states' actions to see if that leads to better rewards.

Given that all previous attempts have low rewards, I think exploring a new configuration is necessary. Let's try setting state 0 to action 3, which allows moving right as one of the options.

But in the top-performing params, state 0 was set to 2 and had f(params) =0.25, so maybe trying a different approach for other states.

Alternatively, perhaps using a more conservative approach where each state moves down unless it's on the rightmost column, in which case move down or right.

But without knowing hole positions, this is speculative.

After considering all these factors, I think the best approach is to propose a new set of params that haven't been tried before, focusing on moving towards the goal while minimizing risk.
