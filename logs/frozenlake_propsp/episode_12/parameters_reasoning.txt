You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy parameters for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right corner) while avoiding holes. The environment is slippery, meaning each action has a 33% chance of going in one of three directions.

From what's provided, all the previous policies have resulted in very low rewards, around 0.00 to 0.05. That suggests that the current policies aren't performing well at reaching the goal or avoiding holes consistently. So, I need to think about how to structure a policy that can navigate effectively despite the slipperiness.

I remember that in such grid environments, it's often useful for states near the goal to have actions that directly approach the target. For example, state 15 is already the goal, so no action is needed there. State 14 (to the left of 15) should probably move right, and state 11 (above 15) should move down.

Looking at previous policies, I notice that they might not be taking the most direct paths or are getting stuck in loops. So, perhaps a policy that guides the agent towards the goal by moving right and down more directly would help.

I think each state's action should be chosen to maximize the chance of moving closer to the goal. For example:

- In state 0 (top-left), moving right or down could be good starting points.
- States in the top row (0-3) should generally move right towards higher-numbered states, which are closer to the bottom-right.
- Similarly, states in earlier columns should prioritize moving right and then down.

Also, considering the slipperiness, each action choice should account for possible drifts. So, if a state is near the goal, it's better to have actions that directly aim towards the goal, as any deviation might not matter much due to the high reward of reaching 15.

I should also check if there are any known holes in the environment. From the trajectories provided, some agents fall into loops or get stuck moving left/right without making progress. So, the policy needs to avoid such situations by ensuring each state's action leads towards the goal without getting trapped.

Putting this together, I'll outline a tentative policy where:

- States near the bottom-right (like 12, 13, 14, 15) have actions pointing directly towards 15.
- Middle states prioritize moving right or down based on their position.
- Top row states focus on moving right to approach lower columns and rows.

I need to make sure that each state's action doesn't lead the agent into a hole. Since I don't know where the holes are, I'll assume they're in certain positions (like state 5 or 7) based on previous trajectories, so I should avoid actions that might send the agent towards those states.

Now, constructing the params array step by step:

- For each state i (0 to 15), decide the action that best moves towards the goal without risking falling into a hole.
- If a state is already in the bottom-right area, choose right or down if possible.
- For other states, prefer actions that move closer to the goal.

After considering all these factors, I'll propose a specific set of actions for each state, ensuring they align with moving towards the goal and avoiding risky moves that could lead into holes.
