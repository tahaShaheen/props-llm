You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help optimize a policy for the FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get the agent from the start (state 0) to state 15 without falling into any holes along the way. The environment is slippery, meaning each action has a 33% chance of moving in one of three directions.

From the problem description, I know that the policy is an array of 16 elements, where each element corresponds to the action taken when in a specific state. My task is to propose these values step by step, aiming for the highest possible reward, which should be around 1.0 if we've found the optimal policy.

Looking at the provided data, the top-performing policies are giving rewards around 0.45 and below. That suggests that none of them have yet reached the goal consistently or avoided all holes effectively. My job is to explore different parameter configurations to maximize the reward.

In the most recent iterations, two policies were tried:

1. The first had a very low reward (0.00) but led to a trajectory where the agent stayed in state 0 and then moved to state 4. This might mean it fell into a hole or got stuck.
2. The second policy gave a reward of 0.35, which is better than the first but still far from optimal.

Since the rewards are significantly below 1.0, according to the problem's strategy, I should act as an "Explorer." This means I need to propose a new set of parameters that haven't been tried before to gather more information and potentially discover a path to the goal or avoid holes better.

I recall from the initial setup that certain states have holes, but their exact positions aren't specified. Therefore, the policy needs to be designed such that it avoids moving into those states. The optimal strategy likely involves a combination of actions that maximize the chances of reaching state 15 while minimizing risks of falling into holes.

In the previous best policies, many had params[0] set to 1 or 2. I might try changing this to see if another action could be more effective from the start. For example, setting params[0] to 3 might encourage moving right more often, which is a direction towards state 3 (right) and then potentially down towards state 7, but given the slipperiness, it's risky.

I also notice that in some top policies, params[6], which corresponds to state 6 (position 2,2), were set to 1 or 2. Maybe adjusting this could help the agent navigate around holes once it gets closer to the goal.

Considering all these factors, I'll propose a new set of parameters where each state's action is chosen based on maximizing the likelihood of moving towards the goal while avoiding risky paths. This might involve more right and down movements from certain states but also incorporating left and up to correct course if needed.

Finally, ensuring that each parameter is unique compared to previous ones will help maximize information gain for future iterations.
