You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, let's try to figure out how to propose the next set of parameters for the FrozenLake environment. The goal is to find a policy that maximizes the reward by reaching state 15 without falling into any holes.

First, I need to understand the current situation. From the provided information, the best-performing policies are giving an average reward around 0.30, which is still below the target of 1.0. This suggests that we're not yet optimal and need to explore more.

Looking at the top 6 best params, I notice a pattern where some states have actions that might be leading towards state 15 but are getting stuck or falling into holes. For example, in one trajectory, the agent goes (0,1) -> (4,2) -> (8,2). This path seems to move down and right but doesn't reach the goal. Maybe adjusting certain states' actions could help avoid loops or dead-ends.

In the most recent 5 params, all have a reward of 0.05 or less, which indicates that these policies aren't effective. Perhaps they're getting stuck in cycles or falling into holes early on. For instance, one trajectory repeatedly stays in state 0, moving down but not making progress towards 15.

I should consider modifying the policy to encourage movement towards the goal more directly. Since the environment is slippery, the agent's actions have a probability of moving in different directions. Therefore, choosing actions that generally point towards the right or downward might increase the chances of reaching state 15.

Looking at each state, I can think about what action would best guide the agent towards the goal while avoiding holes. For example:
- In state 0 (top-left), moving right (action 1) could help move towards state 3.
- In state 1 (top-middle), moving down or right might be better to avoid getting stuck on the left side.
- In state 4 (middle-left), moving right or down would help progress towards the goal.

I should ensure that each state's action choice doesn't lead into a hole. From the trajectories, it seems that certain states are more prone to falling into holes when taking specific actions. For example, if in state 0, choosing action 3 (left) is bad because it might loop or fall into a hole.

Therefore, I'll propose a new set of parameters where each state's action is chosen to either move towards the goal or avoid holes effectively. I'll make sure that this configuration hasn't been tried before and is distinct from previous attempts to maximize information gain.
