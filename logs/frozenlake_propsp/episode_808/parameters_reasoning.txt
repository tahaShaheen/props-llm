You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out the best policy parameters for the FrozenLake environment to maximize the episodic reward. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right corner) without falling into any holes. Since the environment is slippery, each action taken by the agent results in a random movement with three possible directions each having equal probability.

First, I need to understand how the policy works. The policy is an array of 16 numbers where each index corresponds to a state (0-15) and each value represents the action to take when in that state. The actions are mapped as follows: 0 for down-left-up, 1 for right-down-left, 2 for up-right-down, and 3 for left-up-right.

From the provided trajectories and rewards, it seems that most policies are not performing very well, with rewards around 0.45 being the highest so far. The optimal reward is expected to be around 1.0, which suggests that there's room for improvement in the policy design.

I should consider how each state's action choice affects the agent's path towards the goal. For example, states near the edges might have limited movement options due to boundary constraints. Holes are present, so the policy must avoid actions that could lead the agent into these holes even probabilistically.

Looking at the recent policies, many of them seem to loop or take paths that don't efficiently move toward the goal. To maximize reward, the agent should be encouraged to move towards state 15 as quickly as possible while avoiding known holes.

I'll think about each state and what action would best lead towards the goal without falling into a hole:

- **States on the top row (0-3):** Moving right is a good strategy since it progresses towards the goal. However, due to slipperiness, there's a chance of moving in other directions, so the policy should still be cautious.

- **States on the leftmost column (0,4,8,12):** Moving down or right could be beneficial depending on proximity to the goal.

- **States near the goal:** They should prioritize actions that have a higher probability of reaching state 15. For example, in state 14, moving right leads directly to 15, so choosing an action that increases this chance is crucial.

I also notice that some trajectories involve getting stuck or looping, which suggests that certain policies are not encouraging progress towards the goal. Therefore, adjusting actions in these states could help break loops and push the agent toward state 15.

Given that the current best reward is around 0.45, it's clear that the policy isn't consistently reaching the goal. To improve, I should adjust some of the policies to encourage more direct paths towards state 15 while avoiding risky actions near holes.

One strategy could be to have states closer to the goal choose actions that maximize the chance of moving right or down, depending on their position. For example, in state 12 (bottom left), choosing an action that has a higher probability of moving right would help progress towards the goal.

I also need to ensure that actions are chosen such that even with the slippery nature, there's a non-zero probability of reaching the desired next states without falling into holes.

Considering all this, I'll propose a new policy where key states have actions that prioritize moving towards the goal while minimizing the risk of falling into holes. For instance:

- In state 0 (top-left corner), choosing action 1 (right) increases the chance to move right.
- In state 14 (second from bottom, third column), choosing action 3 (which has a higher chance of moving right) increases the probability of reaching state 15.

By carefully selecting actions that guide the agent towards the goal and avoid risky paths, I aim to create a policy that can achieve the optimal reward of around 1.0.
