You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. It's a 4x4 grid, and the agent can move in four directions, but because it's slippery, each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability. The goal is state 15, which gives a reward of +1, and all other states give 0 except for the holes that end the episode.

First, I need to understand how the policy works. The policy is an array of 16 numbers, each representing the action taken from that state (0-15). The actions are 0,1,2,3 corresponding to different movement options, but because of the slipperiness, each action has a 1/3 chance of moving in one of three directions.

Looking at the top 5 best performing params, they all have an average reward around 0.35-0.45. The goal is to get as close to 1.0 as possible, so these are not optimal yet. The trajectories show that some policies loop endlessly or fall into holes quickly, which suggests that the current policies aren't efficient at navigating towards state 15 without hitting holes.

I notice that in the most recent params, the reward is 0.05 and 0.15, which are lower. So maybe we need to try different strategies to get a higher reward.

Since I'm supposed to act as an optimizer now because the rewards aren't close to 1.0 yet, I should tweak parameters slightly but explore new configurations to maximize information gain.

Looking at state 0 (top-left corner), if it's set to action 3 (which moves left, up, or right with equal probability). But since state 0 is already on the edge, moving left might take it out of bounds, but in this environment, perhaps it wraps around? Or maybe it stays. Wait, no, FrozenLake typically doesn't wrap; moving left from 0 would stay at 0 or move to another state. Actually, I think in standard FrozenLake, moving beyond the grid is treated as not moving. But here, the movement options are adjusted because of the slippery nature.

Wait, each action for a given state leads to three possible moves. For example, action 0 from state i will cause the agent to move down, left, or up with equal chance. So for state 0 (top-left), action 0 would have it try to move down, which is state 4? Or wait, no: in a 4x4 grid, moving down from 0 (which is row 0, column 0) would take it to row 1, same column. So state 4.

But the problem mentions that when the agent takes an action, it picks three directions with equal probability. For example, action 0 leads to [down, left, up], each with 1/3 chance.

So for state 0 (top-left), taking action 0 would have a 1/3 chance to move down to state 4, 1/3 to stay in place (left from column 0?), and 1/3 to move up, which might take it out of bounds but probably stays at the same state or perhaps is invalid. Hmm, maybe all movements that go beyond the grid boundaries just don't change the state.

Wait, no, according to standard FrozenLake behavior, moving in a direction that's impossible (like left from column 0) would stay in place. So for state 0:

- Action 0: down (to 4), left (stay at 0), up (stay at 0). So 1/3 chance each.

Similarly, other actions for state 0:

Action 1: right, down, left. Right from 0 would go to state 1; down to 4; left stays. So 1/3 each.

Action 2: up, right, down. Up is invalid, so stay at 0; right to 1; down to 4.

Action 3: left, up, right. Left stays; up stays; right goes to 1.

So for state 0, the best action would be one that maximizes the chance of moving towards the goal without falling into a hole.

Looking at the current policies, most have state 0 set to action 1 or 2. Maybe trying a different action could help.

I think we should try setting state 0 to action 3. Let's see:

Action 3 from state 0: left (stay), up (stay), right (to 1). So each with 1/3 chance. That gives a 1/3 chance to move right towards the goal and 2/3 to stay.

Alternatively, if we set action 1 for state 0: action 1 has right, down, left. So 1/3 to go right to 1, 1/3 down to 4, 1/3 left stays. That's also a good option as it can move right or down.

But since the current policies are not performing well, perhaps we need to explore more aggressive moves towards the goal.

Another approach is to make sure that from each state, the action chosen leads towards the goal with high probability and avoids holes.

I should look at which states are holes. From the problem statement, it's mentioned that some states are holes but not specified which ones. So I need to infer based on trajectories.

Looking at the trajectories provided:

For example, one trajectory is (0,2) → (4,2) → (8,2) → (4,2)... It loops between 0,4,8, etc., which suggests that state 8 might be a hole or leads to a loop. Or perhaps it's not a hole but just inefficient.

Another trajectory is (0,1) → (4,3), which ends the episode. So maybe state 4 is a hole when moving in certain directions? Or perhaps state 3 is a hole because taking action 2 from 0 leads to state 3?

Wait, no: looking at the first params, they have params[0] =1, which means action 1 for state 0. So from state 0, action 1 can go right (state 1), down (4), or left (0). The trajectory shows moving to state 4 and then back.

Hmm, perhaps states like 5,6,7 are holes? Or maybe certain positions in the grid are holes.

Since we don't know which states are holes, the agent has to learn through exploration. So the policy needs to choose actions that have the least risk of falling into unknown holes while trying to reach state 15.

Given that, it's better to have a policy that from each state, tries to move towards the goal as much as possible without getting stuck in loops or falling into holes.

Perhaps a greedy approach where from each state, the action is chosen to maximize the chance of moving right or down (towards the goal) would be best. But because of the slipperiness, it's probabilistic.

Alternatively, since the environment is slippery and stochastic, maybe a more conservative policy that reduces risk by avoiding certain directions could help.

Looking at the most recent params, some have low rewards, which might indicate they are falling into holes frequently. So perhaps adjusting the actions in states near potential holes would be beneficial.

For example, if state 5 is a hole, then from state 4 (second row, first column), choosing an action that doesn't lead to state 5 could help. But without knowing the exact hole positions, it's tricky.

Given all this, I think the best approach now is to slightly modify the current best policies but also introduce some new variations in states where previous attempts have been less successful.

Looking at the top params, they mostly have action 1 for state 0 and other states with a mix. Maybe changing state 0's action from 1 to something else could help break out of loops or avoid holes.

So I'll propose a new set of params where I change some key states' actions. For example:

- Set state 0 to action 3, which has a higher chance to move right.
- Adjust other states in the top row and left column to encourage moving towards the goal without risking falling into holes.

I also need to ensure that all params are unique from previous ones as per the rules. So I'll check against the top 5 and most recent 3 to avoid duplicates.

After considering, here's a proposed new set of params:

- Change state 0 to action 3
- Adjust other states in the first row and column to push towards right or down
- Ensure that from states near potential holes, actions are taken to avoid them

This should help increase the reward by either reaching the goal more often or avoiding holes.
