You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. It's a 4x4 grid with slippery movements and some holes. The goal is to reach state 15, which gives +1 reward, but stepping on any hole ends the episode.

First, I need to understand how the environment works. Each action has three possible outcomes because of the slipperiness. For example, choosing action 0 can lead to moving down, left, or up with equal probability. The same applies to other actions depending on the direction they're associated with.

The policy is a fixed array where each state (from 0 to 15) maps to an action (0-3). The challenge is to set these params such that the agent maximizes its reward, which should ideally be around 1.0, meaning it reaches the goal most of the time.

Looking at the top performing params provided earlier, I notice that some configurations are getting rewards around 0.45. That's decent but not optimal yet. The trajectories show that sometimes the agent falls into holes or takes too long to reach the goal. So, the policy might be leading the agent near holes more often than necessary.

I also need to consider the state transitions and possible holes. From the problem statement, it seems like certain states are holes, but their exact positions aren't specified. The agent must learn which states are safe by observing previous trajectories that ended due to falling into holes.

Given that I can't remember previous attempts (stateless strategy), each suggestion should aim to maximize information gain. Since current rewards are below 1.0, I'm in the explorer phase and need to try new configurations distinct from what's been tried before.

I'll look for params that encourage moving towards the goal while avoiding the holes. For example, states near the bottom right (like state 14 or 13) should probably have actions that push directly towards 15. Also, in slippery conditions, it might be safer to nudge the agent towards multiple directions to avoid getting stuck.

Looking at the recent params, many are suggesting certain action sequences but not consistently leading to the goal. Maybe adjusting some key states' actions could help. For instance, state 0 (top-left) should probably move right or down, depending on the surrounding holes.

I think a good approach is to set each state's action to encourage moving towards the goal while considering possible slip directions. Since actions have three outcomes, choosing an action that covers paths leading away from holes would be beneficial.

For example, in state 14 (which is one step above the goal), taking action 3 might help because it can move right, up, or left. If the agent moves right, it reaches the goal; moving up or left keeps it safe.

I need to ensure that all params are distinct from previous ones and cover a variety of strategies to gather more information about which paths lead to success or failure.
