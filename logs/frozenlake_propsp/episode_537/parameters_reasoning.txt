You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me start by understanding the problem thoroughly.

The environment is a 4x4 grid with states numbered from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). The goal is state 15, which gives +1 reward. All other states give 0, except if you fall into a hole, then the episode ends. The slippery nature means each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability.

The policy is an array of 16 actions (each from 0-3), where params[i] tells what action to take when in state i. My task is to propose such an array that maximizes the reward.

Looking at the previous attempts, the highest reward so far is around 0.30, which is low compared to the target of 1.0. That suggests there's room for improvement.

I notice that many policies have params[15] set to either 2 or 3. Since state 15 is the goal, it's logical to stay there once reached. So, setting params[15] to an action that doesn't move makes sense. But according to the environment description, taking any action from state 15 (the goal) might cause movement due to slippery nature, but since it's the terminal state, maybe no movement is possible. Wait, actually, in standard FrozenLake, reaching the goal ends the episode, so perhaps once you're at 15, you don't move anymore. So setting params[15] to any action is irrelevant because the episode would end upon arrival.

But looking at the trajectories provided, some agents took actions even when they were on state 15. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe in this setup, taking an action from state 15 could still lead to other states or just stay there. I'll need to verify.

Next, let me think about how to structure the policy for each state:

- For state 0 (top-left), it can move down (to state 4) or right (state 1) or up (but that's out of bounds? Wait no, in this setup, actions are taken with three possible directions except for edges. So from state 0, moving up would take you to a hole, perhaps?

Wait, I'm not sure which states are holes. The problem didn't specify them, but it said the agent needs to avoid stepping on them based on previous trajectories. From the provided examples, some states lead to falls.

Looking at the top-performing params, they had certain actions that led to avoiding holes and moving towards the goal. For example, one trajectory went (0,1) → (4,2) → (8,2). So from state 0, action 1 (which has a possible move right or down or left), but action 1's possible moves are right, down, left with equal probability.

Wait, the environment is slippery: taking an action leads to one of three directions. For example, action 0 would lead to moving down, left, up each with 1/3 chance.

I need to figure out which actions from each state will maximize the chances of reaching 15 without falling into holes.

Let me consider the optimal path: starting at 0, move right or down. But due to slipperiness, any action could lead in three directions. So the policy needs to choose an action that statistically increases the chance of moving towards the goal and avoiding holes.

For state 0:

Possible actions are 0 (down, left, up), 1 (right, down, left), etc. If I pick action 2 or 3 for state 0, what happens? Let me see: Action 2 from state 0 leads to moving right, up, or down each with 1/3 chance.

Wait, according to the problem:

- When action is 0, possible moves are down, left, up.
- Action 1: right, down, left.
- Action 2: up, right, down.
- Action 3: left, up, right.

So for state 0 (top-left corner), moving up would take it out of the grid? Or is it a hole? Because in the standard FrozenLake, some states are holes. The problem says that the agent must avoid stepping on holes by using previous trajectories.

Looking at the trajectories provided:

- One trajectory started with (0,1) leading to state 4, then 8.
- Another was (0,3), which went to state 0 again.
- Some others went into loops or fell into holes.

From this, perhaps certain states are more dangerous. For example, state 7 might be a hole because in one trajectory, the agent took action 2 from state 4, leading to state 8, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's look at the first example:

params[0]:2; ... leads to trajectory (0,1) → (4,2). So state 4 is accessible via down from 0. Action 2 in state 4 (which is action=2: up, right, down). From state 4, moving down would go to state 8 (third row), right to state 5, up back to state 0.

Similarly, in the second example, params[0]:1 leads to action 1 from 0, which could go right, down, or left. Left would take it out of bounds? Or is that a hole?

I think I need to figure out which states are holes. The problem didn't specify them, but we can infer from the trajectories.

Looking at the provided examples:

- A trajectory went (0,3) → (0,3) repeatedly and then fell into a hole.
- Another trajectory went (0,1) → (4,2) → etc., leading to reward 0.30.

I suspect that certain states are holes, such as state 7, perhaps, but I'm not entirely sure without more info.

Given the uncertainty, maybe it's better to design a policy that moves towards the goal while avoiding edges where possible.

A common approach in FrozenLake is to move right and down towards the goal. But due to slipperiness, the agent can't be certain of the next state.

Let me try to construct a policy:

- For states closer to the goal (like 12,13,14,15), choose actions that increase the chance of moving right or down.
- For other states, choose actions that have a higher probability of moving towards the goal.

But considering the slipperiness, perhaps choosing action 2 or 3 for most states would allow movement in multiple directions, increasing the chances of reaching the goal.

Looking at previous best params:

In one example, params[0]:2; which corresponds to action 2. From state 0, this could move up, right, down. But since moving right is towards the goal (state 1), and moving down goes to state 4, perhaps that's a good choice.

Similarly, for state 15, set params[15] to any action that doesn't lead away, but in standard FrozenLake, reaching 15 ends the episode, so perhaps it's irrelevant. But according to some trajectories, agents took actions from 15, so I need to handle it.

Wait, maybe state 15 is a terminal state where taking any action keeps you there or doesn't matter because the episode ends upon arrival. So setting params[15] to anything might not affect the outcome once reached.

But in some cases, agents took actions from 15 and continued moving, so perhaps it's better to set params[15] to an action that doesn't move them away. For example, if you're at 15, taking action 0 (down) could take you to 15 again or other states. But since 15 is the goal, maybe it's best to stay there by choosing an action that loops.

Alternatively, perhaps once you reach 15, any action leads back to 15, but I'm not certain.

Given all this, let me try to propose a new set of params.

I'll start by setting params[15] to 0. Then, for each state, choose actions that have the highest chance of moving towards the goal.

Looking at previous successful trajectories:

- The first example went (0,1) → (4,2) → (8,2). That suggests that from 0, action 1 leads to state 4, which is down. Then, from state 4, action 2 (which can go up, right, down) led to state 8.

So perhaps for state 4, choosing action 2 is good because moving down would take it closer to the goal.

Similarly, in state 8, choosing action 3 might lead to state 12 or other states.

Wait, let me map out possible moves:

- State 0 (0,0):
  - Action 0: down to 4, left to ...? Left from 0 would be invalid, perhaps a hole. So maybe action 0 is risky.
  - Action 1: right to 1, down to 4, left to ... (invalid). So action 1 might have a chance to move right or down.

But in the previous example, choosing action 2 for state 0 led to moving to state 1 (right), which then went to state 4 via action 2.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe it's better to choose actions that balance between moving towards the goal and avoiding edges where holes are likely.

Given that, let me try a policy where:

- For states in the top row (0-3), prefer right or down.
- For states in the leftmost column (0,4,8,12), prefer right or up/down appropriately.

But considering the slippery nature, choosing actions with more varied movement might be better to increase exploration and avoid holes.

Alternatively, perhaps a greedy approach where each state chooses an action that statistically moves it closer to the goal.

Given the time constraints, I'll propose a new set of params based on previous successes but tweak some values to explore further.
