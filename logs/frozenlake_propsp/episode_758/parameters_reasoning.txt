You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with the highest possible reward, and I know that some states are holes which end the episode if stepped on.

First, I need to understand how the slippery actions work. Each action taken by the agent results in a 3-way split of direction choices, each with equal probability. So, for example, choosing action 0 (left) could result in moving down, left, or up. This makes the environment stochastic and adds uncertainty.

Looking at the provided trajectories and their rewards, I notice that most policies are giving low rewards, around 0.45 on average. The best performing one is 0.45, which is far below the target of 1.0. So, as an explorer, I should try configurations that haven't been seen before to gather new information.

I need to identify states that might be holes. From the trajectories provided, some paths lead to falling into holes or getting stuck in loops. For instance, one trajectory keeps moving left from state 0 and doesn't progress towards the goal. That suggests that certain actions in specific states are leading to failure.

I should focus on key states like 0 (top-left), 7 (top-right), 12 (bottom-left), and 15 (goal). Also, states near these might be holes or offer better paths.

Let me consider possible actions for each state. For example, in state 0 (start), taking action 1 could lead to moving right, down, or left with equal chance. If I choose action 3, it would allow movement up, right, or left. But since the top row can't go beyond, maybe choosing an action that encourages moving towards the goal.

I should also look at states near the edges and corners, as they have fewer possible moves. For instance, state 15 is the goal, so any action there might not matter, but it's terminal. State 14 (bottom-right) needs to move right or up, but since it's already in row 3, moving down isn't possible.

Perhaps I should set policies that minimize the chance of falling into holes by avoiding certain directions. For example, if a state adjacent to a hole has an action that could lead there, choosing another action might prevent failure.

Let me consider some potential params configurations:

1. For states near the goal (like 13), setting actions that push towards right or down.
2. For starting states, actions that encourage exploration towards the center or directly towards the goal.
3. Avoiding actions that could lead to loops, like moving left repeatedly in state 0.

I think a good strategy is to make sure each state's policy action directs towards the goal while considering possible slips. Maybe setting params such that from each state, the agent has a higher chance of moving towards the goal despite the slippery nature.

Looking at previous attempts, some have tried various actions but haven't reached high rewards. So, perhaps changing certain key states' actions could help. For example, in state 0, choosing action 1 might push towards right or down, which are promising directions.

I'll propose a new set of params where each state's action is chosen to maximize the chance of moving towards the goal while avoiding holes. This means setting specific actions that, despite the slipperiness, guide the agent closer to 15.
