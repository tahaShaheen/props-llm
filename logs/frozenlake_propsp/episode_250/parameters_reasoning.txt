You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy parameters for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right corner) while avoiding holes on certain paths. The agent can take actions that are slippery, meaning each action has a 1/3 chance when it's not the desired one. 

I remember that in such environments, exploration is key because if we're following a policy based on just rewards, we might get stuck on the hole if it's not noticed quickly. So I need to ensure that the agent doesn't settle into a local optimal solution by exploring different paths and avoiding previously visited or dangerous areas.

The parameters are an array of 16 values representing actions for each state from 0 to 15. Each value can be 0, 1, 2, or 3. The current policy is [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1], meaning all actions are 1.

I should consider different combinations of these parameters that encourage exploration and prevent getting stuck in the hole. Maybe some higher values for certain actions to allow the agent more opportunities to explore other paths before it's too late to fall into a hole.

Looking at the examples provided, they show various combinations where certain states are assigned specific actions. For example, params[0]:2 means action 2 is taken when in state 0, which might encourage exploration because all possible actions (except maybe some) are tried more often.

I think I should look for a balance between exploitation and exploration. Exploitation would be sticking to the current policy, but since it's all 1s, perhaps there's room to increase some values where more exploration is needed.

Also, avoiding the hole states by making sure that when stepping on them, the agent doesn't fall immediately. That suggests that any action leading into a hole should have lower rewards (0 instead of +1). So maybe I can adjust the parameters so that certain actions are less likely in those hole states.

Since all reward values except 15 are zero, but once you step onto a hole, it's terminal, perhaps focusing on avoiding stepping on the holes by choosing actions that minimize the risk. However, since all steps lead to other states, maybe the policy should prevent getting stuck on dangerous transitions.

I think I'll try assigning higher action numbers (like 2 or 3) where possible for more exploration, and lower ones elsewhere. Maybe something like params[0]:1, params[1]:3, params[2]:2, etc., to encourage exploring other paths before falling into a hole.

Alternatively, maybe setting some parameters to 0 can help avoid getting stuck on certain transitions that lead into the hole without causing too much loss in reward. But I need to ensure that overall, the policy is still improving towards the goal.

After thinking through various combinations and considering the examples given, I believe assigning higher values (like 2 or 3) to some actions would encourage more exploration and thus a better chance of finding the optimal path without getting stuck. So perhaps a parameter array where certain states take action 2 or 3 for more varied exploration.
