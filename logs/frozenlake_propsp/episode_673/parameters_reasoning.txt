You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me start by understanding the problem thoroughly.

The environment is a 4x4 grid where each cell represents a state from 0 to 15. The goal is state 15, which gives a reward of +1, while all other states give 0. However, there are holes that can end the episode if stepped on. The agent's movement is slippery because each action leads to one of three possible directions with equal probability.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 values, where each value corresponds to the action taken in that state. My goal is to find the optimal policy that maximizes the average episodic reward, which should ideally be around 1.0 if it's perfectly avoiding holes and reaching the goal efficiently.

Looking at the provided data, the top-performing policies have rewards ranging from 0.35 down to 0.20, which are significantly below the optimal target of 1.0. This suggests that either the current policies aren't effectively navigating towards the goal or they're not avoiding holes properly.

The recent attempts show several policies with very low rewards (like 0.00), indicating that some states might be leading into holes frequently. For example, in state 0 taking action 3 leads to moving left, down, or right—maybe that's causing issues near the edges. Similarly, other states seem to get stuck in loops or move away from the goal.

To improve, I need a policy that directs towards the goal while avoiding risky moves that could lead into holes. Let me consider key states:

- State 15: Always action 0 (but since it's the goal, maybe not needed).
- States near the bottom-right corner should aim to move right or down.
- For states in the middle, actions should generally push towards state 15.

But considering the slippery nature, each action has a 33% chance of going three different ways. So, the policy needs to choose actions that have at least one safe path towards the goal without high risk of falling into holes.

Looking at the best policies, they often take action 1 or 3 in state 0, which might help in exploring more directions. However, since the rewards are still low, perhaps a more direct approach is needed.

I think a greedy approach where each state's action leads towards the goal as much as possible would be better. For example, in state 0 (top-left), moving right or down would make sense. But given the slippery nature, I should choose actions that have a higher chance of progressing towards the goal without high risk.

Wait, but since each action has three possible outcomes, maybe selecting an action that covers the most promising direction while having other safe options as alternatives could work. For example, in state 0, choosing action 1 (right, down, or left) might have right leading to state 3 and down to state 4. But if it goes left, it stays in state 0—so maybe that's not ideal.

Alternatively, action 2 from state 0 would allow moving up, right, or down—but up isn't possible since it's the top row. So moving right (state 3) or down (state 4). Maybe choosing action 1 is better because from state 0, moving down leads to state 4, which might be safer.

Wait, looking at the trajectories, some policies get stuck in loops, like going back and forth between states without making progress. So I need a policy that avoids such loops by ensuring each step moves closer to the goal or doesn't backtrack unnecessarily.

For instance, in state 1 (top-middle), choosing action 3 might allow moving right, up, or left. But if it's already on the top row, moving up is impossible, so action 3 would have a chance to move right (state 2) or left (state 0). Maybe that's not the best.

Alternatively, action 1 in state 1 allows moving right, down, or left—right leads to state 2, which is better. So perhaps state 1 should take action 3 or 1.

This seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can look for patterns in the optimal policies. In the top-performing examples, they have a mix of actions that seem to guide towards the goal but might not be efficient enough.

Since the average reward is still low, perhaps exploring more aggressive movements towards the goal while avoiding risky states would help. So, maybe setting certain states to always move right or down when possible, considering their position.

But I also need to ensure that the chosen actions don't lead into holes. The environment's holes are unknown, so the policy should be robust enough to avoid them regardless of their positions.

Given that, perhaps a deterministic approach towards the goal is better. For each state, select the action that maximizes progress towards state 15, considering all possible outcomes. But since the movement is probabilistic, I need to choose actions that have at least one safe path leading towards the goal with high probability.

Wait, but without knowing where the holes are, it's tricky. Maybe using a policy that tries to move towards the right and down as much as possible would be safer, assuming those directions generally lead closer to state 15.

For example:

- State 0 (top-left): action 1 (right or down)
- State 1: action 3 (right or up, but since we're in row 0, moving right is better)
- States in the first column (like states 4,8,12) might benefit from moving right if possible.

Alternatively, perhaps a policy that systematically moves towards increasing row and column indices would work. So, each state's action should have a higher chance of leading to higher-numbered states, which are closer to 15.

But given the slippery nature, I need to choose actions that cover multiple directions but include safe steps towards the goal.

Wait, looking at the recent policies, many of them have low rewards because they might be stuck in loops or falling into holes. So perhaps a more conservative approach is needed where each action has a higher chance of making progress without high risk.

Maybe setting up a policy that, from each state, chooses actions that can move towards the goal while also having alternative safe moves if the primary direction isn't possible.

For example:

- In state 0: choose action 1 (right, down, left). Since right leads to state 3 and down to state 4, which are both steps toward the goal. Left keeps it in state 0, but perhaps that's acceptable as a backup.
- In state 1: choose action 3 (left, up, right). Right leads to state 2, which is progress; left goes back to state 0, which might not be ideal, but maybe better than other options.
- In state 4: choose action 2 (up, right, down). Up would take it back to state 0, which isn't helpful. So perhaps moving right or down is better. Action 2 allows right (state 5) and down (state 8), both of which are steps towards the goal.
- In state 8: choose action 3 (left, up, right). Right leads to state 9, which is progress; left goes back to state 7, which might not be optimal. Maybe choosing an action that has a higher chance of moving right.

This approach seems logical, but I'm concerned about the slippery nature causing unintended movements into holes. Therefore, it's essential to test these policies and see how they perform in terms of reward.

Given the current situation where rewards are still low, perhaps suggesting a policy that tries to move towards the goal more directly would help. Maybe setting states closer to the bottom-right to choose actions that push them towards 15 without backtracking.

For instance:

- States in row 3 (like 12,13,14) should focus on moving right or down if possible.
- States in column 3 (states 3,7,11,15) should move down or right as needed.

But I need to ensure that the actions chosen don't lead into holes. Since I don't know where the holes are, the policy must be robust against any hole placements.

After considering all this, perhaps a reasonable approach is to set each state's action to either right or down when possible, and have alternative safe actions if those directions aren't feasible due to grid boundaries or holes.

Given that, here's an attempt at constructing such a policy:

- For states in row 0 (states 0,1,2,3), prefer moving down.
- For states in column 3 (states 3,7,11,15), prefer moving right or down as appropriate.
- For other states, choose actions that move towards the goal without backtracking.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look for a policy that has been tested and works well, but given the data, the best performing ones are still around 0.35, so perhaps my approach needs refinement.

Another thought: maybe using dynamic programming to find the optimal Q-values or Value function would help, but since I can't plan or remember previous attempts, I have to suggest a policy that maximizes information gain each time.

Given the constraints, I think suggesting a new policy that explores different paths towards the goal while avoiding loops and risky moves is necessary. So perhaps changing some key states' actions to more directly push towards 15.

After careful consideration, here's my proposed params array:

params[0]: 2, params[1]: 3, params[2]: 2, params[3]: 3, params[4]: 1, params[5]: 3, params[6]: 3, params[7]: 2, params[8]: 3, params[9]: 3, params[10]: 2, params[11]: 3, params[12]: 2, params[13]: 3, params[14]: 1, params[15]: 3
