You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to help find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me break down what I understand so far.

First, the environment is a 4x4 grid where each cell represents a state from 0 to 15. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right corner) for a reward of +1, while avoiding holes which end the episode with no reward. The slippery nature means that each action taken by the agent results in moving in one of three directions with equal probability.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 elements (params), where each element corresponds to the action taken when in a specific state. The actions are 0, 1, 2, or 3, each leading to different movement probabilities as described.

Looking at the top-performing params provided, all have relatively low rewards around 0.15-0.20. This suggests that the current policies aren't efficiently reaching the goal most of the time. The trajectories show varied paths, but none consistently reach state 15 quickly or avoid holes effectively.

My goal is to propose a new set of params that either explores new areas (if rewards are low) or optimizes around high-performing areas (if rewards approach 1.0). Since current rewards are below 0.20, I should focus on exploration.

I need to ensure the proposed params haven't been tried before. Looking at previous examples, many have similar patterns. To maximize information gain, I'll choose a policy that encourages moving towards the goal while minimizing hole risks.

Considering the grid layout, states near the bottom and right are closer to the goal (15). So, for states in these regions, actions should aim to move further right or down. For example, state 0 is top-left; moving right (action 1) could help reach other states. Similarly, states like 14 (one before goal) might benefit from specific actions.

I'll also consider how the slippery nature affects movement. Each action has a 1/3 chance of going in each of three directions. So, for each state, choosing an action that has a higher probability of moving towards the goal or away from holes is crucial.

Looking at state 15, it's already the goal, so no action needed there. For other states like 14, which can reach 15 with certain actions, I'll set the corresponding params to encourage movement right or up/down as appropriate.

Let me draft a new set of params:

- For states near the top-left (0-3), actions should generally move towards the right or down.
- For middle states, actions should push towards the bottom-right.
- Avoiding holes requires careful consideration; for example, states that lead to holes might need actions that avoid moving into those directions.

I'll assign each state an action that statistically increases the chance of reaching the goal while reducing falls into holes. Since all previous params have low rewards, I'll try varied strategies to see which works best.

Here's a tentative plan:

- States 0-3: Action 1 (right) or 2 (down)
- States 4-7: Action 2 (down) or 3 (left/up, depending on position)
- Continue this pattern towards the goal, ensuring that each state has an action that statistically moves closer to 15.

I'll construct params accordingly, ensuring they're unique from previous attempts.
