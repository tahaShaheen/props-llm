You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I need to figure out the best policy parameters for the FrozenLake environment using a reinforcement learning approach. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right corner) with the highest possible reward. 

First, I'll recall that the agent can take actions based on certain probabilities. When it's in state i, it chooses an action from a specific set of options. For example, when at state 0, it picks from [down, left, up], each with equal probability. So each action has a value of 1/3.

The current params array starts with all values as 1.0, meaning the agent is equally likely to choose any action in any state. My task is to adjust these parameters to find a policy that maximizes the expected reward.

I think I should start by considering known optimal policies for the FrozenLake problem. From what I remember, there are standard approaches where certain states encourage specific actions. For instance, sometimes moving up or down might be better in different parts of the lake due to avoiding holes and reaching the goal quickly.

Looking at some examples provided:
- params[0]: 2; others vary. This seems like it's encouraging the agent to move left from state 0.
- Another set where moving right is preferred when possible, but sometimes up or down are chosen randomly.
- A more cautious approach with random choices except for certain states.

I should also consider that in states near the hole (like some 6s), the agent needs to avoid stepping on them. So actions that lead into these holes might be discouraged unless necessary.

Considering all this, I think a policy where the agent avoids holes whenever possible could lead to better performance. For example, from state 3, which is near the bottom left with a hole, it's better to move up or right rather than down since moving into the hole would end the game.

So, I'll set params[6] (state 3) to 0 because stepping into this state leads to an immediate reward of -1. Similarly, in other states near holes, I should adjust their actions accordingly.

Putting it all together, I'll define each action's probability based on whether that action leads the agent closer to a hole or not. For instance:
- At states where the hole is present (like 3), choose an action that avoids it.
- In other states, prioritize actions that lead towards the goal without hitting any holes.

After defining these probabilities, I'll simulate the policy starting from the initial state and evaluate its performance to see if it improves over time. From the examples given, a slight shift towards avoiding certain actions seems beneficial, especially near holes.

Finally, I'll propose a policy where states with holes prefer other actions while others choose based on proximity to the goal. This should help in reducing chances of stepping into holes and maximizing the reward.
