You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get an episodic reward of around 1.0, which means successfully reaching state 15 without falling into any holes.

First, I need to understand the problem better. The agent moves in a 4x4 grid where each state corresponds to a number from 0 to 15. There are slippery actions, meaning that when the agent takes an action, it can end up moving in one of three directions with equal probability. The challenge is to find a policy (params array) that maximizes the reward.

Looking at the history provided, I see several attempts with their corresponding rewards and trajectories. Most recent policies have very low rewards (0.00), which suggests they're not effective. The best so far achieved 0.45, which is still below the target of 1.0. This indicates that while some progress has been made, a better strategy is needed.

I notice that in the top-performing params, certain states are being handled in specific ways. For example, state 0 (top-left corner) often takes action 1 or 2. But since the environment is slippery, taking any single action might not guarantee reaching the goal without falling into a hole. I need to ensure that each action chosen doesn't lead to a hole with probability 1.

To improve, perhaps I should focus on states near the goal (like state 15) and see what actions are being taken there. If the policy for these states isn't set correctly, it might be causing the agent to loop or fall into holes. For example, if state 14 is taking an action that could send it back instead of towards 15.

Also, considering the slippery nature, maybe the policy should be more conservative in certain areas and bolder in others. Maybe states near the edges or corners have fewer safe moves, so their actions need to be carefully selected.

I should also look for patterns in the trajectories. If the agent keeps revisiting the same states without making progress towards 15, that suggests a loop or inefficient path. Adjusting the actions in those states might break the loop and allow the agent to move closer to the goal.

Another thing is to ensure that once the agent reaches state 15, it stops, but I think in this setup, the episode ends upon reaching the goal, so that's handled.

Since I'm supposed to maximize information gain each iteration without memory, I should propose a new params array that explores different actions in critical states. Maybe changing some of the less effective actions or trying to set up a path towards 15 that avoids known holes.

Given the current attempts, perhaps states near the bottom-right (like 12, 13, 14) need specific attention. For example, state 14 should have an action that can lead it to 15 with as much probability as possible without falling into a hole. Since moving right from 14 is towards 15, but due to slipperiness, maybe taking the right action would be better.

Wait, actually, looking back at how actions are mapped: each action leads to three possible moves. So for state i, when action a is taken, there's a 33% chance of moving in each of the three directions associated with that action.

So, I need to choose actions such that from each state, the agent has a non-zero probability of reaching the goal without falling into holes.

Perhaps a greedy approach: set policies for states close to the goal to take actions that increase the chance of getting closer. For example, in state 14, taking action that includes moving right (if possible). But I need to check which actions from each state lead where.

Alternatively, maybe using a value iteration approach, but since I can't remember previous steps, it's tricky. Instead, I should propose a params array that tries to move towards the goal in as straight a line as possible, avoiding loops and dangerous areas.

Looking at the current best params (first example), they have certain patterns, but perhaps tweaking some of the less effective states could help. Maybe changing actions for states that are leading into loops or not making progress towards 15.

Another thought: since all policies so far aren't performing well, maybe I need to take a more exploratory approach. Propose a completely new set of params that deviates from previous attempts, focusing on getting the agent closer to the goal without falling into holes.

I'll try to construct a params array where each state is mapped to an action that, when executed, has the highest chance of moving towards 15 or avoiding holes. For example:

- State 0 (top-left): Maybe action 3, which could move right, down, or up. Moving right would take it closer to the goal.
- States near the top row should try to move down or right where possible.
- Middle states need to balance moving towards the bottom-right while avoiding edges that have holes.

I'll draft a new params array with these considerations in mind, ensuring that each action choice doesn't lead into known holes and increases the chance of reaching 15.
