You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment using a global RL approach. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) with the highest possible reward, which should ideally be around 1.0 since that's when you get the +1 reward.

First, let me understand the problem setup. The grid is 4x4, and each state corresponds to a position from 0 to 15. The movement isn't straightforward because the environment is slippery, meaning each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability. So, for example, taking action 0 (left) could result in moving down, left, or up.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 numbers, where each element corresponds to the action taken from that state. The challenge is to choose these actions such that the agent avoids the holes and maximizes the chance of reaching state 15.

Looking at the provided data, the best performing policies have rewards around 0.45, which is far below the target of 1.0. This suggests that we're still in the exploration phase where the environment hasn't been adequately mapped yet. The trajectories show that many policies are either falling into holes or not reaching the goal quickly.

Since the agent is stateless and can't remember previous attempts, each iteration must maximize information gain. Given that the rewards are low, I should focus on exploring new configurations rather than exploiting known good ones.

In the recent trials, most policies have f(params) around 0.05 to 0.45, which indicates a lot of variability and not much consistency in reaching the goal. This suggests that many states might still be leading into holes or not effectively guiding towards the goal.

To improve, I need to propose a new set of params that's distinct from previous ones, especially focusing on the starting positions (like state 0) and key paths towards the goal. For example, state 0 is the top-left corner; if it chooses action 2 (up), but since movement is slippery, we have to see what direction that leads. However, looking at previous policies, maybe choosing different actions could help avoid traps.

I'll try creating a new policy where each state's action is chosen to move towards the goal as much as possible while avoiding holes. For instance:

- From state 0 (top-left), if I choose action 2 (up), but considering movement probabilities, it might actually go up, right, or down. Since up from 0 would stay in the same row? Wait, no—each state is mapped such that moving up from a top row state would probably lead to another position or maybe out of bounds. I need to think about how each action affects possible moves.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to have policies where from each state, the agent tries to move in directions that generally progress towards the goal (right and down). However, given the slippery nature, this is tricky.

Another approach is to look at states near the holes and ensure that their actions don't lead into them. For example, if a hole is at state 5 (which is position (1,1)), then from neighboring states, the agent should avoid actions that might send it there.

But without knowing exactly where the holes are, I have to infer based on previous trajectories. From the examples given, some trajectories end quickly, suggesting that certain actions lead into holes.

Given all this, I think I'll propose a new policy where each state's action is chosen to move towards the right or down as much as possible, with some variability to explore other paths if stuck.

Here's a tentative params array:

params[0]: 2 (up), but considering movement options for action 2: up, right, down. Maybe this helps in moving towards the goal.
Wait, no, from state 0, which is top-left, moving up would stay in the same row? Or perhaps it's better to move right or down.

Alternatively, maybe choosing action 1 (left) for state 0? But that might lead west, which is outside the grid. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the movement is such that from each state, moving in a direction may not stay within bounds. So perhaps we need to make sure actions don't cause going out of the grid, but the environment probably wraps around or treats it as a hole? Not sure.

Given the uncertainty, I think a safe approach is to choose action 2 for state 0 (up), which might have a higher chance of moving right or down. But without exact knowledge, it's hard to say.

I'll proceed by creating a params array where each state tends to move towards the goal as much as possible, with some randomness baked in due to the slippery nature. I'll also ensure that from states near known problematic areas (like those leading to holes), actions are chosen to avoid them based on previous trajectory data.
