You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with a reward of +1, and avoid the holes which end the episode. 

First, I need to understand how the slippery actions work. Each action has three possible outcomes with equal probability. For example, choosing action 0 (left) could result in moving down, left, or up. This makes the environment stochastic, so the agent's next state isn't certain.

Looking at the provided top params and their rewards, it seems like most policies aren't performing very well, averaging around 0.2 to 0.3 reward per episode. The best is 0.30, which still needs improvement since the global optimal should be near 1.0.

I notice that some trajectories are getting stuck or falling into holes. For instance, a policy might send the agent towards a hole without knowing it's there. To avoid this, each state's action should have a path that avoids known holes and gradually moves closer to the goal.

Since I'm supposed to act as an optimizer now (rewards are not close to 1.0 yet), I'll tweak previous high-performing policies slightly. Let's look at one of the top params:

- One policy had params[0] =2, which is action 'right' or maybe another direction, leading to state 4 on the second row.

But wait, in the grid, moving right from state 0 (top-left) would take it to state 1. However, due to slipperiness, it might go elsewhere. So perhaps choosing a direction that generally moves towards the goal is better, but considering all possible outcomes.

I need to ensure each action choice leads away from holes and towards the goal. For example, in state 0 (top-left), moving right or down could be safer. But since the environment is slippery, I should choose actions that have a higher probability of making progress.

Looking at the grid, the optimal path would likely involve moving right or down. So for each state, choosing an action that has the most potential to move towards 15, considering all possible outcomes.

I might set states near the goal (like 13, 14) to choose actions that directly lead to 15. For other states, choosing actions that have a balance of moving right and down.

Also, I should ensure that no action from any state leads into a hole. So if certain states are holes, their neighboring states' actions must avoid those directions.

Given the top policies didn't get high rewards, maybe exploring different combinations could help. Perhaps more aggressive moves towards the goal in certain states.

I'll propose a new set of params where each state chooses an action that has a higher chance of moving right or down, depending on their position. For example:

- States in the top row might prefer moving right.
- Middle rows might choose down or right based on proximity to the edge.

But I have to ensure all possible outcomes don't lead into holes. So if from state 0, choosing action 1 (which can go right, down, left), but since moving right is towards the goal, maybe it's better than others.

Wait, actually, the agent's actions are mapped to specific movement sets:

- Action 0: [down, left, up]
- Action 1: [right, down, left]
- Action 2: [up, right, down]
- Action 3: [left, up, right]

So each action from a state has three possible moves. To get towards the goal (state 15), which is at the bottom-right, I should choose actions that have a higher chance of moving right or down.

For example:

- In state 0 (top-left), choosing Action 1 would allow right movement with 1/3 probability.
But since the environment is slippery, sometimes it might move down or left, which could be bad if those lead into holes.

Alternatively, choosing Action 2 from state 0: [up, right, down]. Moving up isn't possible from row 0, so it would wrap around? Or maybe stay in place. So perhaps moving right is better.

I think I'll structure the policy to have states in the top row choose actions that can move right or down, and middle rows choose down or right as well.

For example:

- States in column 3 (like 3,7,11,15) might just choose actions that keep them there if they're already on the edge.

But I'm not sure. Maybe trying a policy where each state chooses an action that has a higher chance of moving towards the goal, considering all possible outcomes.

Another approach is to have states closer to the bottom-right choose actions that directly aim for 15, while others move towards it.

I'll try creating such a policy and see if it's different from previous ones.
