You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help optimize the policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I know that the environment is a 4x4 grid with the goal at state 15. The agent can move in four directions, but due to the slippery nature, each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability. There are holes on some states which end the episode if stepped into.

The policy is represented by an array of 16 elements, each corresponding to a state (0-15). Each value should be one of [0,1,2,3], indicating the action taken from that state.

Looking at the information provided, I see that the best performing policies so far have average rewards around 0.45. The goal is to get as close to 1.0 as possible, which means reaching the goal consistently without falling into holes.

The recent trajectories show some issues with loops or getting stuck in certain areas, like moving between states 0 and 1 repeatedly, or getting stuck at state 4. This suggests that the current policies might not be avoiding holes effectively or are taking inefficient paths to the goal.

To improve, I should focus on making sure each state directs towards a path that avoids holes and moves closer to the goal. For example, states near the bottom right (like 12, 13, etc.) should aim for state 15.

I need to explore different actions in critical areas. Maybe changing some of the recent policies to try different actions could help break out of loops or avoid holes. Since the agent is stateless and can't remember previous steps, each proposed policy must be self-contained and optimal on its own.

Looking at the most recent parameters provided, I see that they might not be steering towards the goal effectively in some states. So, perhaps tweaking a few key states to choose actions that move more directly towards the right or down could help reach the goal faster without falling into holes.

I'll propose a new set of parameters where each state is mapped to an action that generally moves it closer to the goal (right or down), while avoiding known hole positions. Since the environment is slippery, I need to account for all possible directions each action might take and ensure none lead to holes with high probability.

After considering all this, here's a new set of parameters where each state directs towards states that are safe and closer to the goal:

params[0]: 2, params[1]: 3, params[2]: 1, params[3]: 3, params[4]: 0, params[5]: 1, params[6]: 1, params[7]: 2, params[8]: 3, params[9]: 1, params[10]: 2, params[11]: 0, params[12]: 1, params[13]: 3, params[14]: 2, params[15]: 3
