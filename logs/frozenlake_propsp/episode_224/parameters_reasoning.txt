You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the best policy parameters for the FrozenLake environment based on the information provided. The goal is to reach state 15 with the highest possible reward, which should ideally be around 1.0. 

First, let me understand the setup. The grid is 4x4, so there are 16 states. Each state corresponds to a number from 0 to 15. The slippery environment means that when an agent takes an action, it has a 33% chance of moving in one of three directions. The policy is defined by an array of 16 numbers, each representing the action (0-3) taken at each state.

Looking at the top 8 best-performing params, all have f(params) around 0.20 or lower. That's significantly below the target of 1.0, so I'm likely in the exploration phase. The trajectories provided show that some policies lead to falling into holes or getting stuck in loops without reaching the goal.

I should focus on creating a policy that avoids the holes and has a path towards state 15. Since the environment is slippery, the agent's movement isn't guaranteed, so the policy needs to account for multiple possible paths while minimizing risks of falling into holes.

One approach is to design the policy such that from each state, the chosen action leads towards the goal (state 15) with as few obstacles as possible. For example, in the top-left corner (state 0), moving right or down might be better. However, considering the slippery nature, choosing actions that have a higher probability of eventually reaching the goal without hitting holes.

Looking at the recent params and trajectories, most policies are getting stuck or falling into holes because their actions aren't leading them safely towards the goal. I need to propose a new set of parameters that hasn't been tried yet and can potentially reach state 15 more effectively.

I'll go through each state and decide which action would be safest and most likely to lead towards the goal:

- State 0 (top-left): Maybe move right or down. Let's choose moving right, so action 1.
- States in row 0: Moving right towards higher columns might help reach the end. So for states 1, 2, 3, actions that push towards state 3 and then to 7, etc.
- Middle states should have a mix of actions to navigate around possible holes.

But considering all the slippery movements, perhaps setting each state's action to move in such a way that it has an overall drift towards the goal. For example, from any state not on the bottom row, moving down; from rightmost columns, moving right might help reach the end.

However, without knowing the exact positions of the holes, this is challenging. Since the user didn't specify which states are holes, I need to assume that certain states are unsafe based on previous trajectories where agents fell into them.

Given that in the recent attempts, policies led to falling into holes or getting stuck, perhaps a more conservative approach is needed, ensuring that each action from a state doesn't have any risky possibilities. Alternatively, maybe using a combination of actions that can navigate around potential holes by having multiple paths.

But since I can't remember previous attempts (stateless), I should propose a new set of params that's different from all previously seen ones and has a higher chance of reaching the goal safely.

After considering, perhaps setting each state in the top row to move right or down. Similarly, states in the leftmost column might benefit from moving right or down as well. For middle states, mixing actions but ensuring movement towards the bottom-right.

Wait, looking at the recent params that performed better, some had action 1 for multiple states. Maybe varying the actions more could help. Alternatively, perhaps setting all to action 1 except certain states.

But I need to propose a new set without repeating previous ones. Let me think of a specific configuration:

- For state 0: action 1 (right)
- State 1: action 3 (which moves in three directions with some chance down)
- Continue this way, but ensuring that from each state, there's a path towards the goal.

Alternatively, perhaps setting all states to move right when possible and down otherwise. For example:

States 0-3: right
States 4-7: down
States 8-11: right
States 12-15: stay or something? But state 15 is the goal.

Wait, no, because moving in certain directions can lead to holes, so I need to ensure that from each state, all possible next states are safe.

Alternatively, perhaps using a greedy approach where each action from a state leads towards the goal with maximum probability. Since the environment is slippery, maybe choosing actions that have the highest chance of eventually reaching the goal without falling into holes.

But without knowing hole positions, I'll proceed by proposing a new set of parameters that's different from previous ones and likely to navigate towards the goal.

Perhaps setting most states in the top row to move right or down, middle states to move towards the bottom-right, and bottom states to move right until state 15.

After considering all this, here's a proposed params configuration:

params[0]: 2 (up)
Wait, but moving up from state 0 would loop back. Hmm, maybe not good. Let me think again.

Alternatively, setting state 0 to action 1 (right), which has a chance to move right, left, or down. That might help in avoiding falling into the same hole repeatedly.

I'll proceed by constructing a params array where each state's action is chosen to generally move towards the goal while considering possible slips.
