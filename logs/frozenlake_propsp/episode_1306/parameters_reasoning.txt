You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let's see what we have here.

The environment is a 4x4 grid where each cell can be slippery, meaning actions don't always lead to the intended direction. The goal is state 15 (the bottom right), and there are holes that end the episode if stepped on. The policy is a function mapping each of the 16 states to one of four possible actions.

From the information given, the best performing policies have rewards around 0.45, which is lower than the target of 1.0. This suggests that we're not yet near the optimal solution, so I should focus on exploration rather than exploitation.

Looking at the most recent parameters and their trajectories, it seems like many are getting stuck or falling into loops. For example, some policies keep moving in one direction without making progress towards the goal. Others fall into holes early on. This indicates that the current strategies aren't effectively navigating around the holes or reaching the goal consistently.

I need to propose a new set of parameters that tries different actions in key states to explore more paths. Maybe adjusting certain states' actions could help avoid holes and move closer to the goal. For instance, if state 0 is currently choosing action 1 (right), but that leads to state 3 which might be a hole, perhaps changing it to another action like down or up could help.

I should generate a new parameter set where each state's action is varied enough to explore different paths without repeating previous strategies. This way, we can gather more information about the environment and potentially find better reward paths.

Let me think of each state and possible actions that might lead towards the goal while avoiding holes. For example:

- State 0 (top-left): Maybe moving right or down.
- States in the top row: Moving right to progress towards the goal, but avoiding edges with holes.
- Middle states: Choosing actions that move towards the right or bottom, depending on their position.

I'll create a new params array where each state is set to an action that could potentially lead towards the goal while considering the slippery nature. For example:

params[0] = 1 (right)
params[1] = 2 (up? Or maybe down if it's safer)
Wait, need to think about the possible outcomes of each action.

Alternatively, perhaps setting some states to move in multiple directions to increase chances of reaching the goal without falling into holes. Maybe a combination of right and down actions for different states.

I'll generate a new set where several key positions have varied actions to explore different trajectories.
