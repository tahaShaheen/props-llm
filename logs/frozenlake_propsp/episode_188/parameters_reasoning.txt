You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to find the global optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment using this reinforcement learning setup. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right corner) and get a reward of +1. However, some states are holes that will cause the game to end if stepped on again. The agent has to explore through previously visited trajectories by reading history.

First, I need to understand how the policy parameters work. The policy is an array of 16 values where each value corresponds to a state (from 0 to 15). Each parameter represents an action when in that state. The actions are 0-3, corresponding to left, down, up, right.

The policy needs to be chosen from [0,1,2,3], so the initial proposal is probably somewhere around those values. But without knowing where the best one is, I need a systematic way to explore different policies.

Looking at the examples provided, some parameters result in higher rewards (like 0.25 or 0.20) but others are worse. It seems that the optimal policy lies somewhere between these extremes. Since the problem mentions that we should not just exploit existing strategies but also explore, I need to balance both exploration and exploitation.

I think a good approach is to perform a grid search over all possible combinations of the parameters. There are 4 actions for each of the 16 states, so there are 4^16 = 4,294,967,296 possible policies. That's too many to check manually. So, I need a more efficient method.

Perhaps I can use an exploration strategy like epsilon-greedy or explore through Q-learning with multiple episodes. Or maybe implement a policy gradient method like Actor-Critic. Since the problem mentions using the policy as a function that takes state indices and returns action values, it suggests a direct approach where each parameter value is learned from experience.

Another idea is to use reinforcement learning algorithms like Q-learning or SARSA, which learn the best action for each state based on the maximum expected reward. But since the current policy parameters are fixed (all set to 2), I need to adjust them during training.

I should consider starting with random values and gradually refining them. Maybe implement a few iterations of gradient ascent to see how the reward changes. However, without a clear direction, it might not converge quickly.

Alternatively, using a genetic algorithm could be effective. It allows me to explore different parameter combinations by evolving them over generations. Each generation would involve evaluating policies based on their reward and then selecting better ones for the next iteration.

Wait, but I think in the context of this problem, since the user wants me to propose specific values from [0-3], maybe it's feasible to try a subset of possible parameter combinations through systematic trial and error. Starting with mid-range values and adjusting based on performance.

I also remember that in some cases, using multiple trajectories or starting from different initial states can help find better policies. But since the agent must explore through history, I have to ensure each trajectory is sufficiently long before evaluating its reward.

Perhaps a more concrete approach would be to use simulated annealing, where parameter values are tweaked slightly and the policy is tested to see if it improves the reward. This could prevent getting stuck in local optima by allowing occasional worse policies during exploration.

Another thought: since all parameters start at 2, maybe I can perturb one or two actions around that value and see how the policy responds. For example, changing action 0 from 2 to 1 or 3, etc., and evaluate the reward after each change.

I also need to consider the state transitions in the FrozenLake environment. Each state has specific probabilities for taking actions 0-2 (left, up, right) which might vary based on whether the agent is near the edges or not. This complicates things because some action choices have higher probability when in certain states.

Maybe I should model the expected reward for each parameter combination by simulating multiple episodes and averaging the rewards. This way, I can get a good estimate of how each set of parameters performs without having to experience every single episode manually.

In summary, my strategy is: start with initial values (like 2), simulate multiple episodes, evaluate their performance, then adjust the parameters based on positive results while keeping some randomness or exploration to avoid getting stuck. It might take several iterations and adjustments but should lead me toward the optimal policy.
