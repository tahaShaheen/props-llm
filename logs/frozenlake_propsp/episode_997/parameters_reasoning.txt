You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure this out step by step. So, I'm trying to help find the global optimal policy for a FrozenLake environment with some specific parameters and constraints.

First, I need to understand the environment setup. It's a 4x4 grid where each cell is a state from 0 to 15. The agent can move in four directions (up, down, left, right), but because the environment is slippery, each action leads to three possible next states with equal probability. So for example, choosing action 0 gives a 1/3 chance of moving down, left, or up.

The goal is state 15, which gives +1 reward, and all other states give 0. There are holes in the grid that end the episode if stepped on, but their positions aren't explicitly given—so I need to figure out where they might be based on the trajectories provided.

Looking at the interactions, the user will provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) and training examples. Then, I have to propose a new set of params each time in a specific format without repeating previous ones. The reward is averaged over 20 episodes for each policy.

In this case, I'm at iteration 997, so there's still some room to explore more policies before hitting the max iterations.

The user has provided some top-performing params and recent ones. From the top 5, most have f(params) around 0.35-0.45, which is below 1.0—so we're not optimal yet. The recent 5 show even lower rewards, with one as low as 0.05.

Given that the rewards are far from 1.0, I should be in "explorer" mode. My goal now is to propose a new set of params that hasn't been tried before and can help identify new information about where the holes are and how to reach state 15 effectively.

Looking at previous params, there's a lot of repetition, especially around certain states like 0,1,2, etc., always choosing actions 1 or 3. Maybe I should vary these to see different trajectories.

I notice that in the recent attempts, some policies are getting stuck in loops (like moving between states 0 and 4 repeatedly) or falling into holes quickly. So perhaps adjusting certain states' actions could help avoid those pitfalls.

For example, maybe state 12 is a hole because in one trajectory, it went to state 9 then to 8, etc., but I'm not sure. To explore more, I need to design params that can test different paths.

Let me try to assign some varied actions across states. For instance:

- State 0: Instead of always action 1 or 2, maybe action 3 to move right.
- State 1: Perhaps action 0 instead of 3 to encourage moving down.
- States around the edges should be cautious about holes.

I need to make sure that each params[i] is from [0,1,2,3], and all are unique in this iteration's proposal. I'll mix up the actions for various states to see if any new trajectories emerge that reach state 15 or avoid holes better.
