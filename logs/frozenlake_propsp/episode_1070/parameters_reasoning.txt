You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 1070 out of 5000. OUTPUT ONLY THIS SINGLE LINE:

Do NOT output anything else. No explanation, no reasoning, nothing.



LLM:
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. So, the grid is 4x4, and the goal is state 15. The agent can move in four directions, but because of the slippery nature, each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability. Holes are present, and stepping on them ends the episode immediately.

From the problem description, I know that the optimal reward should be around 1.0, which means reaching the goal consistently. The current best policies have rewards around 0.45, so there's room for improvement.

Looking at the top-performing params provided earlier, they mostly choose actions that might help navigate towards the goal but aren't entirely effective yet. For example, in state 0 (top-left corner), action 1 is chosen, which could move right, down, or left with equal chance. But perhaps choosing a different action here could lead to better exploration or more direct paths.

I notice that some states are being revisited multiple times, leading to low rewards. Maybe adjusting the policy to avoid loops and push towards the goal more directly would help. For instance, in state 0, instead of moving right (action 1), maybe moving down (action 0) could lead closer to the goal.

I should consider each state's position and what action would best increase the chances of reaching state 15 without falling into holes. Since the environment is slippery, the policy needs to account for the probabilistic nature of movements.

For example, in state 14 (which is row 3, column 2), choosing action 0 (down) might take it to state 15 if possible, but I need to check if that's a valid move or if it leads into a hole. Similarly, for state 10 (row 2, column 2), perhaps moving right or down would be better.

I should also consider the holes' locations. From the trajectories provided, some states might have led to holes when specific actions were taken. So adjusting the policy to avoid those dangerous moves is crucial.

After analyzing, I think changing certain key states like 0, 4, and 12 could help. Maybe setting state 0 to move down (action 0) instead of right or other directions. Similarly, for state 12, which is near the bottom-left, moving right or up might be safer.

I need to ensure that each action in the policy helps navigate towards the goal without increasing the risk of falling into a hole. Testing different actions and seeing their outcomes through the provided trajectories will help refine the policy further.
