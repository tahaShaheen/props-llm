You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment using a deep Q-learning model. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right corner), which gives a reward of +1, while avoiding the holes in the map. When stepping on a hole, the agent gets zero reward and has to explore by revisiting previously seen trajectories.

The policy is represented as an array of parameters from [0,1,2,3], each corresponding to a state (0-15). The values of these params determine the action the agent takes when in that state. The task is to choose these values from [0, 1, 2, 3] such that the episodic reward f(params) is maximized at the end of training.

From the provided examples and recent trajectories, it seems like states with an odd index (like 0,2,4,...) tend to take action 0, while even indices might prefer action 1 or 2. But this isn't always clear.

The recent trajectory has params[0]: 2, which I think corresponds to state 0. Looking at the top performing parameters, when in state 0, it's taking action 0 (since params[0] = 2) leads to an f reward of 0.10. Similarly, state 4 takes action 1 (params[1]=3), which also gives a reward of 0.15.

However, I'm not sure if this is the global maximum. Maybe there's another combination that yields a higher reward across all states.

I should consider how each action affects neighboring states and whether it leads to more optimal paths towards the goal. For instance, certain actions might avoid holes or lead directly to the goal without unnecessary steps.

But given the complexity of the state space (16 states), trying every possible combination manually isn't feasible. I'll need a systematic approach, maybe using gradient descent to adjust each parameter based on the learning signal from the rewards and transitions between states.

Starting with an initial guess like [2,0,3,2,1,0,1,3,...], as per one of the top performers, but it's uncertain if this is optimal. I could evaluate how changes in each parameter affect the expected reward and adjust accordingly to maximize the average reward across all transitions.

But without knowing the exact dynamics of the Q-values or the learning rate, it's challenging to make precise adjustments. This problem likely requires implementing an iterative improvement algorithm where I update parameters based on the difference between current action and the optimal one in each state.

In summary, while I can identify some patterns from the provided examples, a comprehensive search across all possible parameter combinations is needed for the global optimum. This might involve using algorithms like Q-learning with policy gradients or actor-critic methods to learn the optimal policy directly from experience.
