You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15, which gives a reward of +1, while avoiding holes that end the episode with 0 reward. The environment is slippery, meaning each action can lead to three possible directions with equal probability.

Looking at the problem, I need to create a policy where each state (from 0 to 15) maps to an action (0-3). The challenge is to find the optimal set of actions that maximizes the reward by avoiding holes and reaching the goal as efficiently as possible.

From the provided data, the best performing policies have an average reward around 0.45, which is still below the target of 1.0. This suggests that we're not yet consistently reaching the goal without falling into holes. 

In the recent attempts, most policies result in trajectories where the agent either gets stuck in a loop or falls into a hole. For example, one trajectory goes from state 0 to 3 repeatedly without making progress towards the goal. Another ends up moving in circles around states 2 and 6, which might be near a hole.

To improve, I should consider policies that encourage movement towards the goal while minimizing the risk of falling into holes. Since the environment is slippery, the agent's actions have inherent uncertainty, so the policy needs to account for all possible outcomes of each action.

I notice that in some successful cases, the agent moves right or down more often, which makes sense because the goal is at the bottom-right corner (state 15). However, due to the slipperiness, moving in these directions might not always lead directly towards the goal but increases the chances over multiple steps.

One approach is to set up the policy so that each state encourages movement towards the right or down, depending on the position. For example:
- In states where the agent is on the top row (0-3), encourage moving right or down.
- In states on the leftmost column (0,4,8,12), encourage moving right to progress towards the goal.
- In other states, balance between moving towards the goal and avoiding holes.

I should also look at the current best policies and see if tweaking certain actions could lead to better outcomes. For instance, in state 5, changing from action 1 to another might help avoid a hole or get closer to the goal.

After considering all this, I'll propose a new set of parameters where each state is assigned an action that aims to move towards the right or down, adjusting based on the position to avoid known holes and increase the chances of reaching the goal.
