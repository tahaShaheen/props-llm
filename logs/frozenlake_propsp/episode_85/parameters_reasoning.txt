You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help the agent find the optimal policy in the FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with the highest reward possible. The policy is represented by a vector of parameters where each parameter corresponds to an action when the agent is on a specific state.

First, I remember that the environment is slippery, meaning each action has a certain probability of choosing one of the three directions (left, up, down). When taking an action, the agent moves in a way that considers all three options equally likely. However, some states are dangerous if stepped into, like holes that end the game, so the agent must avoid them.

The policy is represented by params[0] to params[14], each corresponding to actions for their respective state numbers (0-15). The goal is to find the set of parameters that maximizes the expected reward over time.

I need to consider how changing these parameters affects the policy. Each parameter in [0, 2, or 3] represents a different action when on certain states. For instance, params[0] determines the action for state 0, which is moving down. So, if I increase params[0], that would mean taking the down action more often.

I should evaluate how each parameter affects the overall reward. Since all other parameters contribute to the expected value except when a hole is stepped on, I need to ensure that policies avoid states leading into holes as much as possible. This might require adjusting certain parameters to have lower probabilities for unsafe actions.

Considering that the agent should explore to find these holes and use previous trajectories, my policy needs to balance between exploiting known good paths and exploring new ones to find dangerous areas. Therefore, a probabilistic approach is suitable here, where higher values of params[i] indicate more likely taking action i, but I must ensure that all actions are considered without bias towards any specific direction except for the slippery effect.

I also notice in some top-performing parameters, multiple actions have similar or even negative probabilities, suggesting they were chosen less frequently. So, perhaps this indicates that those actions were either not taken as often as others, which is consistent with my exploration strategy.

To find the optimal point, I should run simulations where different parameter values are tested to see how the expected reward changes. By gradually adjusting each parameter and observing the resulting f(params) at each iteration, I can identify the parameters that yield the highest reward on average without missing any potentially dangerous areas.

I'm a bit stuck on which specific parameters to adjust. Maybe I should start by considering each action's impact on the agent's state transitions. For instance, adjusting params[0] (down) might change how often the agent chooses down, influencing its path and potential risk of hitting a hole.

Another thought is that since all other parameters have actions like left, right, up, which are not as slippery or as dangerous as down, perhaps they contribute less to the reward but also require careful management. This could mean that certain parameters should be increased when there's more uncertainty about safe paths.

I also need to make sure I'm considering the entire state space, from (0,0) to (3,7), and not just focusing on certain states. Each action taken can lead the agent into different parts of this grid, affecting subsequent probabilities.

Maybe a strategy is to use an iterative approach where in each step, I adjust one parameter at a time while keeping others fixed and evaluate how it affects f(params). This way, I can see which adjustments lead to higher rewards and fine-tune them accordingly. However, since the environment's dynamics are somewhat complex with slippery probabilities, this might be computationally intensive.

Alternatively, perhaps using an optimization algorithm like gradient descent or a genetic algorithm could help find the optimal parameters more efficiently. These methods can systematically explore different parameter combinations and converge on the one that maximizes f(params) while avoiding dangerous areas.

I also need to remember that each step of the agent's exploration might lead to revisiting previously seen states, but as long as there are no holes involved in those paths, it shouldn't affect my policy too much. So focusing on improving the parameters identified through exploration is key.

In summary, I should adjust each parameter corresponding to specific actions when certain states are reached, with an emphasis on balancing between exploiting safe and beneficial paths while exploring new areas for holes. By systematically evaluating these adjustments and their effects on f(params), I can converge towards the global optimal policy.
