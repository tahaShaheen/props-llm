You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out the best next move for optimizing the policy in this FrozenLake environment. Let me start by understanding the problem thoroughly.

So, we have a 4x4 grid where the agent moves around, and there are holes that can end the episode if stepped on. The goal is state 15, which gives a reward of +1. All other states give 0, except for the holes which result in termination without a reward. The environment is slippery, meaning each action has a 33% chance to go in one of three directions.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 numbers (params), each representing the action taken from that state. My goal is to propose a new set of params that hasn't been tried before and can help maximize the reward, especially since the current best is around 0.10, which is much lower than the target of 1.0.

Looking at the top 5 best-performing params provided earlier, all have f(params) around 0.10. The trajectories show that these policies are either not reaching the goal or falling into holes quickly. For example, one trajectory went from state 0 to 4 (down), then to 8 (down again), which is a hole. Another fell into a hole after moving right and down.

The most recent two params also didn't perform well, with rewards of 0.05 and 0.00. The trajectories indicate that the agent isn't effectively navigating towards the goal but instead gets stuck or falls into holes.

Since I'm supposed to act as a stateless optimizer, I need to maximize information gain without remembering past attempts. Currently, all top params seem to be similar, so I should try something different. Maybe I can change the policy in a way that encourages moving towards the right more often, especially near the goal area.

I also notice that some states might have holes, so the policy needs to avoid them. For example, state 15 is the goal, but if the agent steps there, it's done. So I need to ensure that when close to 15, the actions lead directly towards it without risk of falling into a hole.

Let me think about each state:

- States near the top-left (0-3) should aim to move down or right.
- Middle states (4-7, 8-11) need careful navigation to avoid holes.
- Bottom-right states (12-15) should prioritize moving towards 15.

Looking at the previous policies, many have params[1] as 1 or 3. Maybe changing that to a different action could help. For instance, setting params[1] to 0 (left) might not be helpful because it moves away from the goal. Alternatively, maybe making some states choose actions that directly aim towards the center or edges.

Another thought: perhaps using more deterministic policies where certain states are set to move directly towards the goal could help. For example, setting params[15] to 0 (since being at 15 ends the episode) but ensuring that the state before it leads correctly.

Wait, actually, state 15 is terminal. So when the agent is in state 14 (which is row 3, column 3- wait no: 12-15 are the bottom row, so 12 is (3,0), 13 is (3,1), 14 is (3,2), and 15 is (3,3). So to reach 15 from state 14, the action should be right (action 0?), but I need to check what each action does.

Wait, in the problem description:

- Action 0 leads to down, left, or up with equal probability.
- Action 1 leads to right, down, or left.
- Action 2 leads to up, right, down.
- Action 3 leads to left, up, or right.

So for state 14 (which is (3,2)), the goal is to reach 15. The possible actions:

If action is 0: moves down (from row 3, can't go further), left, or up. Down would be same state? Or maybe wraps around? No, in FrozenLake, moving beyond grid ends in a hole or stays.

Wait no, the movement directions are such that if you try to move outside the grid, it's considered as a failure (i.e., falling into a hole). So from state 14 ((3,2)), taking an action that would go down would lead to a hole. Similarly for other actions.

So to reach state 15, from 14, the agent needs to move right. But what action leads to moving right?

Looking at the action definitions:

- Action 0: possible moves are down, left, up.
- Action 1: right, down, left.
- Action 2: up, right, down.
- Action 3: left, up, right.

So, from state 14, to move right (to state 15), the agent can take action 1 or 2 or 3. Because those actions include moving right as one of the options.

Therefore, setting params[14] to any of these actions would give a 1/3 chance to move right and reach the goal, which is better than other options that might lead down into a hole.

Similarly, for state 12 ((3,0)), to get to 15, the agent needs to move right twice. So the policy should be set to actions that have moving right as an option.

Looking at previous params, I notice that some states are set to action 0 or 1. Maybe I can adjust certain key states to choose different actions.

Given that all top-performing policies so far aren't achieving high rewards, perhaps a more greedy approach towards the goal could help. For example, setting as many states as possible to move right when in the last row and move down otherwise might be beneficial.

Alternatively, perhaps using action 1 (which includes moving right) for certain states can increase the chance of moving towards the goal without falling into holes.

Another consideration is avoiding actions that have a high probability of leading to holes. For example, from state 0 (top-left corner), taking action 3 might lead to left or up, which could be out of bounds and thus holes. So setting params[0] to an action that doesn't risk moving left or up is better.

Similarly, for other edge states, the policy should avoid actions that would take them outside the grid.

So, perhaps I can create a new set of params where:

- States in the last row (12-15) are set to actions that include moving right (actions 1, 2, or 3).
- Middle states are set to move down or right.
- Top states avoid moving up or left.

But since each action has a 33% chance of three directions, the policy can't be fully deterministic. So I need to pick actions that maximize the chances of moving towards the goal while minimizing the risk of falling into holes.

Let me try constructing such a policy:

For states near the bottom-right, set params to actions that have a high chance of moving right or down (but down from row 3 leads to hole, so better move right).

Wait, no: in state 14 ((3,2)), taking action 0 would lead to trying to go down, which is a hole. So it's better to take an action that includes moving right.

So for state 14, set params[14] to 1 (which can move right), so there's a 1/3 chance each of moving right, down, or left. From 14, moving right leads to 15 (goal), which is good. Moving down would be hole, but since it's only 1/3 chance, perhaps that's acceptable.

Similarly, for state 12 ((3,0)), the options are:

- Action 0: down (hole), left (out of grid, hole), up.
- Action 1: right, down (hole), left.
- Action 2: up, right, down (hole).
- Action 3: left (out of grid, hole), up, right.

So for state 12, the best action is 1 or 2 because they have a chance to move right. So set params[12] to 1 or 2.

Similarly, in state 13 ((3,1)), same logic applies: take actions that include moving right.

Now, looking at other states:

In state 0 (top-left), possible actions:

- Action 0: down, left (out of grid), up (out). So action 0 could lead to falling into a hole or going down.
- Action 1: right, down, left. Moving right goes to state 1; moving down goes to state 4; left is out.
- Action 2: up (out), right (state 1), down (state 4).
- Action 3: left (out), up (out), right (state 1).

So for state 0, choosing action 1 or 2 might be better as they have a chance to move right or down without immediately falling into a hole.

But wait, moving left from state 0 is out of grid (hole). So if the policy takes action 3 in state 0, which includes moving left, that's risky. So better set params[0] to 1 or 2.

Similarly, for other edge states, ensure that actions don't risk going out of bounds.

Given all this, perhaps setting the following:

- For states in row 3 (12-15), set to action 1 or 2 to have a chance to move right.
- For states in the top row (0-3), avoid actions that lead left or up.
- Middle states can be set to move down towards the goal.

But without knowing which exact states are holes, it's tricky. From the trajectories provided earlier, some paths end quickly, indicating proximity to holes.

Perhaps I should focus on setting key states near the goal to maximize right movements and ensure that other states don't lead into known dangerous areas.

Given all this, I'll propose a new set of params where:

- Most states are set to action 1 or 2 to have a chance to move right or down.
- Edge states avoid actions leading out of grid.
- States closer to the goal have higher chances to move towards it.

I need to ensure that each state's action is chosen from [0,1,2,3], and no duplicates with previous attempts. Since the user mentioned not to propose previously seen params, I'll check against the top 5 provided earlier.

Looking at the first top param: params[0]:1; ... So if I set a different value for some states, that would be better.

Perhaps setting params[0] to 2, which from state 0 has options up, right, down. That might help avoid falling into a hole as much as action 1.

Similarly, for state 7 (which is in the second row), set it to an action that moves towards the goal.

But without knowing the exact locations of the holes, this is challenging. However, I can infer from trajectories where agents fell into holes and adjust accordingly.

For example, in one trajectory, the agent went from 0→4→8, which suggests that state 8 is a hole or leads to one. So perhaps states leading towards 8 are risky.

Therefore, adjusting policies for states that would lead to 8 might be necessary.

But since I can't remember previous attempts (as per stateless strategy), I need to propose something new each time.

Given the current iteration is 85 out of 5000, and the rewards are low, I should act as an Explorer. That means I should try a completely different set of params that hasn't been tried before to gain more information.

I'll construct a new params array where:

- For states in row 3 (12-15), set to action 1 or 2 to have a chance to move right.
- For state 0, set to action 2 (up, right, down).
- For state 1, set to action 3 (left, up, right) but avoid moving left from there as it might go to hole.

Wait, no. State 1 is (0,1). Action 3 in state 1 would have possible moves: left (to 0), up (out of grid, hole), or right (state 2). So setting params[1] to 3 gives a chance to move left (back to 0), right (forward), but also up which is bad.

Alternatively, set params[1] to action 1: right, down, left. From state 1, moving right goes to state 2; down goes to state 5; left back to 0. So that might be safer.

Hmm, this is getting complex. Maybe I should systematically go through each state and decide the best possible action considering the slippery nature and hole risks.

But since I'm supposed to output only the params line, I'll proceed with creating a new set, ensuring it's different from previous attempts.

Looking at the most recent two params:

First recent: params[0]:3; ... ; f(params): 0.05

Second recent: params[0]:3; ... ; f(params): 0.00

So I need to change at least some of these parameters.

I'll propose a new set where:

- Most states in the bottom row (12,13,14) are set to action 1 or 2.
- Middle states are set to move down towards the goal.
- Edge states avoid risky moves.

Let me construct this step by step:

params[0]: Let's try 2. From state 0, action 2 gives up, right, down. Up is out of grid (hole), so better not take that path often.

Wait, but action 2 in state 0: moving up would be a hole. So perhaps setting params[0] to 1 or 3 is better as they don't include up.

Alternatively, set params[0] to 1: right, down, left. From state 0, moving right goes to 1; down goes to 4; left is out (hole). Since action 1 includes a chance to move down and right, which are good directions, maybe that's better.

Similarly, for state 1, set to 3: left, up, right. From state 1, moving left back to 0; up is hole; right to 2. So that might be risky due to the up option.

Alternatively, set params[1] to 1: right, down, left. From 1, right leads to 2; down leads to 5; left leads back to 0.

But considering the slippery nature, I need a mix of actions that have a chance to move towards the goal without immediately falling into holes.

Given time constraints, I'll propose a new set where:

- States in row 3 (12-14) are set to action 1 or 2.
- Middle states are set to move down.
- Top row avoids up and left actions.

But ensuring no duplicates with previous attempts. Looking back at the top params, they had various values, so I'll pick a new combination.

Final proposed params:

params[0] = 1
params[1] = 3
params[2] = 2
params[3] = 0
...
Wait, but this might duplicate previous attempts. To ensure uniqueness, perhaps set some states differently.

Alternatively, maybe set all even-numbered states to action 1 and odd to action 2, just as a test.

But without knowing the hole positions, it's hard to be precise. Given that, I'll propose a new params array where:

- For states in row 3 (12-14), set to 1 or 2.
- For other states, alternate between actions to explore different paths.

But given time constraints and the need to provide an answer, I think I should proceed with constructing a specific example that differs from previous attempts.

After considering all factors, here's my proposed new params array:
</think>

params[0]:1,params[1]:3,params[2]:2,params[3]:0,params[4]:1,params[5]:2,params[6]:3,params[7]:1,params[8]:0,params[9]:2,params[10]:3,params[11]:0,params[12]:2,params[13]:1,params[14]:3,params[15]:2
