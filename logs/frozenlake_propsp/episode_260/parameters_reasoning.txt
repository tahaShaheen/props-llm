You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I need to help the user by determining the optimal policy parameters for their FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right corner) with the highest possible reward. Let me break down the problem step by step.

First, I understand that the policy function maps each state to an action. There are 16 states, numbered 0 to 15. Each state corresponds to a parameter in 'params', where params[0] is the action for state 0, and so on up to params[15].

The user mentioned that the optimal reward should be around None if not found, meaning we aim for maximum reward. The problem states that the global optimal should be sought through policy optimization.

Looking at the provided examples, some policies yield a reward of 1.00, while others have lower rewards like 0.25 or even 0.05. It seems that finding a policy with higher rewards is better. However, it's clear that not all actions in certain states are optimal.

Each state has specific transitions based on the agent's actions. For instance, when taking action 0 from state 1, the agent moves to down, left, or up, each with equal probability (25% chance). Similarly, other actions have different transition probabilities, especially near the slippery tiles where all three directions are possible.

The key is that the policy should avoid stepping on holes. The hole is located at some grid position, which I'll assume isn't the top-left corner since it's a 4x4 grid. It might be at (3,0) or similar, but the exact position is crucial for avoiding it.

I need to create a parameter array where each action corresponds to an optimal choice in its respective state, considering both immediate and future rewards. Since the agent uses the policy function to explore the environment, we aim to find actions that either maximize immediate reward or guide exploration away from holes by ensuring non-slip states can reach them without getting stuck.

I should propose a parameter array where each action is set based on the best possible choice for its state. For example, in states 0 and 1, the optimal action might be 3 (left) because it's safe. In states with slippery tiles, choosing any action could help avoid immediate penalties but may lead to more risky transitions.

After considering all possible actions and their respective outcomes, I'll select parameters that balance exploration for new states while ensuring efficient paths to state 15.
