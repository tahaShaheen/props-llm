You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) without falling into any holes. From the problem description, the environment is slippery, meaning each action leads to one of three possible directions with equal probability. 

First, I need to understand the structure of the grid. It's a 4x4 grid where states are numbered from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). The agent can move in four directions: up, down, left, right, but due to the slipperiness, each action has three possible outcomes.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 elements, each corresponding to a state and indicating which action to take. My task is to find the optimal set of actions that maximizes the reward (which should be around 1.0).

Looking at the provided trajectories, most policies are yielding low rewards, around 0.15 or less. This suggests that the current policies aren't efficiently reaching state 15. Holes are causing episodes to end early.

I need to design a policy that avoids holes and directs the agent towards the goal as much as possible despite the slippery nature of the environment.

Let's analyze the best-performing params so far. For example, one top param had all states set to either 1 or 3. However, the trajectory shows the agent getting stuck or moving away from the goal. This indicates that some actions might be leading the agent into loops or towards holes.

Since the optimal reward is around 1.0, we need a policy where the agent can reliably reach state 15 without hitting any holes. Perhaps the current policies aren't taking the best paths because they're not considering the slippery effect properly.

I should consider what each action does in terms of possible movements. For example, choosing an action that has a higher chance of moving towards the goal despite the slipperiness might be better. Maybe some actions are more reliable than others in certain states.

Looking at the grid, the agent needs to move right and down generally to reach the goal. So, in states where the agent is on the left side, choosing an action that tends to move right makes sense. Similarly, for upper rows, moving down might be better.

I also need to ensure that actions don't lead the agent into holes. For example, certain states near the edges or corners might have adjacent holes, so the policy must avoid actions that could lead there.

Perhaps a strategy where in each state, the action is chosen such that one of its possible outcomes moves towards the goal and doesn't risk falling into a hole. This way, even with the slipperiness, the agent has a higher chance of progressing towards the target.

Another approach is to consider the Q-learning perspective, where each action's value is based on the average of the next states' values due to the slippery transitions. But since we're dealing with policy optimization directly, it's about selecting the best action for each state that maximizes the expected reward.

Given that previous policies are not performing well, maybe a more aggressive movement towards the goal is needed, even if it means taking risks. Alternatively, safer moves that avoid holes but still progress towards the goal might be better.

I should look at specific states and determine which actions would best help reach state 15 without hitting any holes. For example:

- State 0 (top-left): Possible actions could be moving right or down. Since it's on the edge, moving right to state 1 or down to state 4 might be better.

- State 1: Maybe move right again towards state 2, but if there are holes, perhaps moving down to state 5 is safer.

Continuing this way for each state, mapping out the best actions that lead towards the goal while avoiding known holes.

However, without knowing exactly where the holes are, it's tricky. But from the trajectories provided, I can infer possible dangerous states and avoid actions leading there.

Given all this, perhaps a policy that generally moves the agent to the right and down is optimal. So for each state, if moving right is an option and doesn't lead into a hole, choose that; otherwise, move down or another direction.

After considering all these factors, I'll propose a new set of params where each state's action is chosen to either move towards the goal (right or down) in a way that minimizes the risk of falling into holes and maximizes the chance of reaching state 15.
