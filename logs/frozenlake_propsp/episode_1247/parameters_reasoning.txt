You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the best policy parameters for the FrozenLake environment based on the given information. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward by reaching state 15 without falling into any holes. 

First, I should understand the environment setup. It's a 4x4 grid with states numbered from 0 to 15. The slippery nature means each action has a 33% chance of going in one of three directions, depending on the action taken.

Looking at the provided data, the top-performing policies have an average reward around 0.45, which is below the target of 1.0. This suggests that we're not yet close to the optimal solution. So, according to the stateless strategy, since rewards are far from 1.0, I should act as the "Explorer" and propose a new configuration distinct from previous ones.

I remember that holes cause the episode to end immediately upon stepping on them. Therefore, the policy needs to avoid actions that could lead the agent into these dangerous states. 

In the recent policies, some trajectories show agents getting stuck in loops or falling into traps. For example, one trajectory goes (0,3) repeatedly and eventually falls into a hole. So, I should adjust the parameters for state 0 and others to prevent such outcomes.

Let me consider each state's possible actions and their probabilities. For instance, if state 0 takes action 1, it moves right with some probability. But if that leads to a hole, we need to change it. Maybe switching to a different action could help.

Looking at the current top policies, they tend to use a mix of actions, but perhaps there's a more optimal combination. I should check for states near the edges or corners and ensure their actions don't lead towards holes.

I also notice that in some trajectories, agents take too long to reach the goal, indicating inefficient paths. Maybe adjusting certain state actions to move directly towards the goal or avoid unnecessary detours would help.

Since all params must be from [0,1,2,3], I'll go through each state and assign an action that increases the likelihood of reaching the goal without hitting any holes. For example, in state 0 (top-left), choosing action 1 might move right towards state 1, which could be safer or more productive.

Wait, but looking at previous trajectories, some actions lead to loops. Maybe for state 0, using a different action could break that loop and help the agent progress towards the goal.

I'll also consider the overall structure of the grid. The optimal path should generally move right or down towards the goal (state 15). So, I might prioritize those directions in the policy.

After reviewing all states, I'll propose a new set of params where each state's action is chosen to either move directly towards the goal or avoid potential traps based on previous trajectories. This way, we explore new configurations that haven't been tried yet and could potentially yield higher rewards.
