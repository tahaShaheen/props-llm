You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help optimize the policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get the agent to reach state 15 with a reward of +1, avoiding holes along the way. From the problem description, I know that each action has three possible outcomes because the environment is slippery.

Looking at the parameters provided in the top 5 best performing policies, they all have f(params) around 0.35 to 0.45, which are still below the target of 1.0. This suggests that the current strategies aren't leading the agent reliably to the goal or are causing it to fall into holes.

The most recent policies tried didn't perform well either, with some even getting zero reward, indicating they might be leading the agent into holes repeatedly. So, I need to figure out a way to adjust the policy to maximize the chances of reaching state 15 without stepping on any holes.

I notice that in the top-performing policies, certain states are being handled in specific ways. For example, state 0 is often set to action 1 or 2. Maybe changing this could help. Also, looking at state 8 (which is in the third row), the current policies have it set to various actions, but perhaps a different approach would be more effective.

I'm considering making sure that each state's policy directs the agent towards increasing its position towards 15 as much as possible, while avoiding holes. Since the environment is slippery, the policy needs to account for multiple possible moves from each action.

Maybe I should set certain states to take actions that have a higher probability of moving closer to the goal, even considering the slippery nature. For example, in state 0 (top-left), choosing an action that can move right or down might be better. But since the agent can't guarantee the direction due to slippage, it's about increasing the chances over time.

I also need to ensure that for states near holes, the policy doesn't choose actions that could lead into them. For instance, if a state is adjacent to a hole, the action should prefer moving away or towards safer areas.

Perhaps a greedy approach where each state's action is chosen to maximize the probability of eventually reaching state 15, considering all possible slippage outcomes. This might involve setting actions that, on average, move closer to the goal despite the uncertainty.

I think I'll try adjusting some key states:

- For state 0: Maybe choose action 2 (up) but wait, up from 0 is not possible because it's the top row. Oh right, so action 2 for state 0 would try to go up, which might stay in place or move elsewhere. Hmm, perhaps action 1 is better as it can move right, down, or left.

Wait, let me think again. Each action has three possible moves with equal probability. So from any given state, taking an action could lead the agent in one of three directions. The policy needs to pick actions that have a higher chance of leading towards 15 over multiple steps.

I might try setting states closer to the goal to take actions that directly move towards it. For example, state 12 (which is just above 15) should take an action that can go right or down, but considering slippage, maybe set it to action 3 which includes right as one of its options.

Alternatively, perhaps for each state, we choose the action that maximizes the expected reward based on possible transitions. But without knowing where the holes are exactly (since they aren't specified in the problem), I have to infer based on previous trajectories.

Looking at the trajectories provided, some agents fall into loops or get stuck near certain states, suggesting those areas might be near holes or require better navigation.

I think a good strategy is to make sure that from each state, the chosen action increases the likelihood of moving towards 15 while avoiding areas where previous policies have failed. Maybe adjusting key states like 0, 4, 8, and 12 (the starting row) to move right or down appropriately.

Perhaps setting state 0 to action 1, which can move right, down, or left. From there, the agent has a chance to move towards higher-numbered states. Similarly, in state 3 (top-right), action 1 would try to go right, but since it's at the edge, maybe action 3 could be better.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me list out each state and think about optimal actions:

- State 0: top-left. Possible actions that can move towards goal (right or down). So perhaps action 1 (which includes right, down, left) but since moving left isn't helpful from 0, maybe it's better to have a higher chance of moving right or down.

But considering slippage, each action has three possible moves. Maybe choosing an action that covers the most promising directions.

Alternatively, for state 0, choose action 2 (up, which is invalid and might stay in place, so not good). Or action 3 (left, which isn't helpful either). So perhaps action 1 is better as it includes right and down.

Wait no, action 1's possible moves are right, down, left. From state 0, moving left would go to state 3 (same row), but that might not be the best. Maybe action 2 or 3 could also have other benefits.

I think I need a more systematic approach. Let me try assigning actions based on maximizing movement towards 15:

- For each state i, assign an action such that the average of possible next states is as close to 15 as possible.

But without knowing exact hole positions, it's tricky. Alternatively, focus on making sure that once the agent gets near 15, it can reach it without falling into a hole.

Looking at previous policies, some have state 8 (third row, first column) set to action 2 or 3. Maybe adjusting this could help in moving towards the goal.

Perhaps for state 8, setting action 0 would try to move down, but that's already on the third row, so it might stay or go elsewhere. Alternatively, action 1 which includes right and down.

Wait, perhaps I should look at each state and decide the best possible action based on proximity to goal and avoiding potential holes.

Given that time is limited, I'll make an educated guess by adjusting some key states:

- Set state 0: action 2 (up) but since it's top row, might not be useful. Alternatively, set to action 1 which can go right or down.
- State 3: action 3 which includes right and up, but being on the edge, maybe action 1 is better.
- State 4: action 0 which can move down, left, or up; but since it's second row, moving down could be good.
- Continue this for each state, trying to push towards higher-numbered states.

After considering all this, I'll propose a new set of parameters that adjusts certain key states to actions that seem more likely to lead towards the goal while avoiding previous pitfalls.
