You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to propose the next set of parameters for the FrozenLake environment to optimize the policy and reach the global optimal reward around 1.0. Let's break it down step by step.

First, understanding the environment: It's a 4x4 grid with slippery states that can lead to different directions. The goal is state 15, which gives +1 reward, but there are holes that end the episode if stepped on. The policy is an array of 16 actions (0-3) for each state.

Looking at the provided data, the best performing policies have average rewards around 0.45, which is still below 1.0. So we need to explore more to find a better configuration.

The recent parameters tried didn't perform well—some had very low rewards like 0.05 or even 0.0. This suggests that the current strategies might be leading into holes or getting stuck in loops without reaching the goal efficiently.

Since I'm supposed to act as an explorer now because the rewards are below 1.0, I need to try new configurations that haven't been seen before to gather more information about which actions avoid holes and reach the goal.

I'll start by looking at the current top parameters. They seem to have a pattern where certain states choose specific actions. For example, state 0 is often set to action 1 or 2. Maybe changing this could help. Let's try setting state 0 to action 3 to see if moving left initially avoids any traps.

Next, for other key states like the goal (state 15), it should stay as is since reaching it gives the reward. But let's make sure that when near the goal, the actions are directed towards it without slipping into a hole.

Looking at the trajectories, some agents get stuck in loops or fall into holes after a few steps. Maybe adjusting certain states to move more directly towards the goal while avoiding edges could help. For example, state 12 (the bottom row) should move right to reach state 13, then 14, and finally 15.

I'll go through each state one by one:

- State 0: Try action 3 (left). Maybe this avoids the hole that's in the top row.
- States 1-3: These are on the top row. Since it's slippery, moving down or right might be better to avoid staying on the edges where holes are likely.
- State 4: This is the start of the second row. Moving down (action 0) could help move towards the goal.
- Continue this pattern for each state, ensuring that actions guide towards the center or directly towards the goal while considering the slippery nature.

After considering all states, I'll propose a new set of parameters where key positions are adjusted to more right and down movements to navigate towards the goal without stepping into holes. This should help increase the reward as the agent can reach state 15 more efficiently.
