You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help optimize the policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right corner) and get a reward of +1, while avoiding holes. The environment is slippery, meaning each action can lead to three possible directions with equal probability.

From the information given, the best performing policies have around an average reward of 0.45, but we want to reach closer to 1.0. That suggests that the current policies are getting close but not quite optimal yet.

Looking at the most recent params:

- The first recent policy had f(params) = 0.00 and a trajectory leading towards state 3 (which is a hole in row 0, column 3). So maybe we need to adjust the actions around state 0 to avoid getting stuck.
- Another recent policy also had a low reward of 0.05, with a long trajectory that eventually reached state 8 (row 2, column 0), which might be a hole or not.

I notice that in some of the top params, states 0 and 1 are set to action 3, which is [right, down, left]. That could help move towards the goal. But perhaps adjusting some actions near the starting area can improve the success rate.

Since we're at iteration 874, it's time to tweak the best policies slightly rather than exploring new ones. I'll look for small changes that might push the agent towards the goal more effectively.

For example, in state 0 (top-left), if action 3 is chosen, which moves right, down, or left with equal chance. Maybe changing it to a different action could increase the probability of moving towards the right direction.

Let me consider each state and see how adjusting their actions might help:

- State 0: Current action is 3 (right, down, left). Maybe try setting it to 1 instead, which is [right, down, left]. Wait, that's the same as 3. Alternatively, maybe set to 2 (up, right, down), but up from state 0 would loop back, so not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps in some states near the bottom or right, adjusting actions can help avoid loops and reach the goal faster.

Looking at the trajectory of one top policy: (0,1) → (4,2) → (8,2). That suggests that from state 0 taking action 1 leads to state 4. Then action 2 in state 4 leads to state 8, which is another row down.

Perhaps ensuring that states near the bottom and right have actions that push towards state 15 would be better.

Wait, considering the slippery nature, each action has a 33% chance of moving in three directions. So we need policies that maximize the chances of eventually reaching the goal without stepping on holes.

I think it's crucial to set actions for states near the bottom and right to try to move towards state 15 as much as possible.

Looking at state 12, which is the bottom-left corner (row 3, column 0). If action is 1, it could go right, down, or left. Down from 12 would loop, so better to set actions that push towards moving right.

Similarly, for state 13 (bottom row, column 1), action should be towards right or up, but since the goal is at 15, moving right is better.

I'll go through each state and decide on an optimal action:

- State 0: Current action is 1. Let's try changing to action 2 to encourage more upward movement, which might not help. Alternatively, keep it as 1.

Wait, perhaps for states in the top row, moving down is better since the goal is below.

So I'll adjust some of the top row states to push downward and rightward.

After considering all this, here's a proposed new set of params where certain key states have their actions adjusted to move towards the goal more effectively.
