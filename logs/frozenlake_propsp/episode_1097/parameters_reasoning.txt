You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) with a reward of +1, avoiding holes which end the episode. The grid is 4x4, and each cell corresponds to a state from 0 to 15.

First, I need to understand how the slippery nature affects movement. Each action taken by the agent has three possible outcomes, each with equal probability. For example, taking action 0 (left) can result in moving down, left, or up. This adds a layer of uncertainty because the agent's intended move doesn't always lead directly where it wants.

Looking at the state transitions:
- Action 0: moves to [down, left, up]
- Action 1: moves to [right, down, left]
- Action 2: moves to [up, right, down]
- Action 3: moves to [left, up, right]

So each action has a 1/3 chance of going in any of the three directions.

The policy is determined by an array 'params' where each element corresponds to a state (0-15) and specifies which action to take. My goal is to find the optimal set of actions that maximizes the average reward over multiple episodes.

From the examples given, most policies are yielding rewards around 0.25-0.45, which is below the theoretical maximum of 1.0. This suggests that there's room for improvement.

I notice that many policies in the top 5 have similar structures, with certain states taking specific actions. For example, state 0 often takes action 1 or 3, and state 7 takes action 2. However, these configurations aren't consistently leading to the goal because of the slippery nature causing drifts.

To maximize information gain, I should propose a policy that either explores new areas (if rewards are low) or optimizes around the best-performing policies (if rewards are high). Since current rewards are below 1.0, we're in the exploration phase. But since some previous policies have shown moderate success, maybe a slight variation could lead to better results.

Looking at recent params, some states might be choosing actions that loop or don't make progress towards the goal. For instance, if state 7 is always taking action 2 (down), but from there, moving down again would take it into a hole or further away. Maybe changing this action could help.

Alternatively, perhaps certain states are not being explored enough because of the policy choices. If I can find a way to make the agent more likely to reach the goal while avoiding holes by adjusting specific state actions, that would be beneficial.

I'll consider each state and think about which action would best increase the chances of reaching 15 without falling into holes:

- For states near the edges or corners, taking an action that has a high probability of moving towards the goal.
- Avoiding actions that could lead to holes with higher probability.

But since the environment is slippery, it's challenging. Maybe instead of trying to make precise moves, the policy should encourage moves that statistically bring the agent closer to the goal over time.

I think I need to adjust certain states' actions to more effectively navigate towards the goal while minimizing the chances of falling into holes. For example, in state 10 (which is the middle-right cell), taking action 3 might help move right or up, which could be beneficial.

But without knowing where the holes are exactly, it's tricky. The agent has to infer based on previous trajectories. From the given examples, some states have high failure rates when taking certain actions, suggesting that those actions lead into holes with higher probability.

Wait, in one of the recent policies, state 0 takes action 3, which can move left, up, or right. If state 0 is (0,0), moving left or down might be risky as they could take it out of bounds or into a hole. Maybe changing this to action 1 (right, down, left) would have a better chance of moving towards the goal.

Alternatively, maybe state 4 (top-middle-left) should take different actions. From the examples, some policies in state 4 take action 0, which moves down, left, or up. If that's leading to failure, perhaps switching to action 1 could be better.

I think a good approach is to adjust several key states' actions. For example:

- State 0: Maybe action 2 (up) isn't helpful as it's already at the top. Action 1 might help move right or down.
- State 7: Currently taking action 2, which moves down. If state 7 is in the second row last column (state 7 is row 1, col 3), moving down would take it to state 11 (row 2, col 3). Depending on where holes are, this might be safe or not.
- State 14: This is the third row, third column. Moving right would reach the goal. So taking action that has a higher chance of moving right could help.

But since each action's outcome is probabilistic, I need to choose actions that statistically increase the likelihood of reaching the goal without falling into holes.

After considering all this, I think proposing a policy where certain key states have their actions altered might yield better results. For example:

- Change state 0's action from 3 to 1.
- Adjust state 7's action to something else, maybe 3.
- Modify state 14's action to encourage moving right.

But without exact hole positions, it's a bit of a gamble. However, given the current data, making these changes could potentially increase the reward.

Step-by-step explanation:
- Adjusted several key states to encourage movement towards the goal while considering the slippery nature.
- Changed state 0's action from 3 to 1 to move right with higher probability.
- Modified state 7's action to 3 to increase chances of moving up or right.
- Altered other critical states to create a path that statistically leads closer to the goal.
