You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward by reaching state 15 without falling into any holes. From what I understand, the agent moves in a 4x4 grid, and each action has a 33% chance of going in one of three directions because it's slippery.

Looking at the problem, the policy is an array of 16 numbers where each number corresponds to an action (0-3) for each state. The challenge is to find the optimal set of actions that leads the agent to the goal as efficiently as possible while avoiding holes.

The user mentioned that the global optimal reward should be around 1.0, which suggests we need a policy that can consistently reach the goal without falling into holes. So far, in the provided examples, policies have rewards like 0.45 and 0.35, which are below 1.0. That means there's room for improvement.

I need to consider how each state should behave. For example, state 15 is the goal, so any policy that reaches it gets a reward. The holes are in certain states; I'm not exactly sure where they are, but from the trajectories, I can infer which states might be dangerous. 

In the recent examples, some trajectories end quickly because of falls into holes. For instance, one trajectory went (0,1) (4,1) (8,1), and then it seems to loop or fall into a hole. Another trajectory had multiple steps but eventually fell into a hole. So, I need policies that avoid these loops and paths leading to holes.

I think the key is to design a policy that moves towards the goal (state 15) while ensuring that from each state, the actions taken don't lead into known or potential holes. Maybe using some kind of optimal path mapping would help.

Let me try to map out possible paths:

- Starting at state 0 (top-left), the agent can move right (action 3?), down (action 1?), etc.
- From state 4, it's the second row, first column; moving right might be better towards state 7 or 15.

But wait, considering the slippery nature, each action has a 1/3 chance to go in three directions. So, the policy must account for this uncertainty by choosing actions that maximize the probability of reaching the goal while minimizing the risk of hitting holes.

Looking at the recent policies and their trajectories, it seems that certain actions are leading the agent into loops or towards dangerous states. For example, action 1 from state 0 might be causing issues because it leads to state 4, which then goes to state 8, and so on, possibly into a hole.

I should consider policies where each state is mapped to an action that has the highest chance of moving closer to the goal. Perhaps in some cases, staying still isn't possible, but choosing directions that generally move right or down might be better for most states.

Another approach is to look at the optimal Q-learning table for FrozenLake, which is a standard problem. In the standard setup without slipping, the optimal policy is known, but with slipping, it's more complicated. However, maybe we can adapt some of those principles here.

Wait, in the standard FrozenLake, the optimal policy often involves moving right and down towards the goal. But since this environment has slipping, each action choice must consider that any move might not be as intended.

I think a possible strategy is to make sure that from each state, the chosen action leads towards the general direction of the goal, but also avoids areas where falling into a hole is likely. For example, if moving right from a certain state often leads to a hole, perhaps the policy should instead move down or up in those cases.

Looking at the recent parameters and their trajectories, I notice that some policies have high reward (0.45) but still not optimal. Maybe tweaking these parameters slightly could lead to higher rewards.

Given that we're at iteration 1320, which is about a third of the way, and we need to choose the next set of params based on maximizing information gain. Since the current best policies have rewards below 1.0, I should act as an "Explorer" by proposing configurations distinct from previous ones.

So, perhaps changing some actions in states that are crucial for avoiding holes or progressing towards the goal would help. For example, if state 5 is currently set to action 1, maybe switching it to action 2 could lead the agent in a safer direction.

Alternatively, focusing on certain key states might yield better results. For instance, ensuring that state 0 moves right (action 3), state 1 moves down (action 0?), and so on.

But without knowing exactly where the holes are, I need to infer based on the trajectories provided. From the trajectories, it seems that moving from certain states leads to falls quickly, suggesting those might be hole states or near them.

Overall, my approach would be to propose a policy that for each state, chooses an action that has the highest probability of moving towards the goal while avoiding known problematic transitions. Since I can't remember previous attempts, I need to base this on maximizing information gain by testing different configurations.

Perhaps trying a policy where most states move right or down unless it's near the bottom-right corner, then taking specific actions to reach 15. Also, ensuring that from states leading towards holes, alternative actions are taken to divert away.

After considering all these factors, I'll propose a new set of params that differs significantly from previous attempts, focusing on moving towards the goal while avoiding known risky paths.
