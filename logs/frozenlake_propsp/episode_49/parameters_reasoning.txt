You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment using a global optimizer based on the provided parameters. The problem is that the current setup isn't working well because it's getting stuck in local optima instead of finding the global one.

First, I need to understand the environment better. The state is a 4x4 grid, and each action leads to specific transitions. The policy function uses an array where each element corresponds to a state (0-15). When the agent takes an action, it has certain probabilities for moving in different directions based on the current parameter value.

The goal is to reach state 15 with a reward of +1, but stepping into a hole will end the game. The policy should explore through these holes by learning from previous experiences.

I remember that the values of params[i] (for i=0-3) determine the action taken in each of their respective states. Each param is [0, 1, 2, or 3], which means for state 0, using 0 takes action 0; using 1 takes action 1, etc.

The key here is to find the set of parameters that maximizes the expected reward over time. Since the current setup isn't working, I need to adjust how the policies are explored and how rewards are accumulated.

Looking at the examples provided, some params yield a reward of 0.25 or even 0, which suggests that perhaps not all actions are being taken optimally. It might be missing certain transitions that lead to better rewards.

One approach is to try varying each parameter while keeping others fixed and see how the reward changes. Since all parameters are from [0,1,2,3], I can systematically go through each possible combination of these values across the states.

I also need to make sure that in each trial, I'm exploring new paths rather than just repeating old ones, which could cause the agent to get stuck or converge on a local maximum. Maybe using different starting positions would help explore various areas of the grid.

Another thought is about the reward accumulation function f(params). It should consider all possible rewards from taking any action and account for whether stepping into holes is avoided. So perhaps some parameters are better at avoiding certain states that would otherwise end the episode quickly, but give a higher reward elsewhere.

I wonder if using an epsilon-greedy approach could help balance exploration and exploitation. But since we're already considering all possible actions with different probabilities, maybe that's not necessary here.

Perhaps I should try to make sure that for each state, all four possible actions are explored in combination, rather than just choosing one action based on a single parameter. That way, the agent doesn't get stuck in any particular path and can find better transitions.

I also think about whether there's symmetry or patterns in the transitions between states that could be exploited to find better policies. For example, certain actions might lead to similar transitions from different states.

Considering all these points, my plan is to vary each parameter while keeping others fixed across different trials, ensuring that new states are explored every time. This should help the agent learn the optimal path through the environment without getting stuck in local optima.
