You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward by reaching state 15 without falling into any holes. 

First, I need to understand the setup. It's a 4x4 grid with states from 0 to 15. Each action taken by the agent has a 33% chance of moving in one of three directions because the environment is slippery. So, for each action selected (0-3), there are multiple possible outcomes.

Looking at the provided examples and trajectories, I can see that some policies are getting rewards around 0.15 to 0.25, but we need a policy that gets closer to 1.0, which means reaching the goal consistently without falling into holes.

The agent's trajectory shows paths like (0,1) leading to (4,2), then to (8,2). This seems to be moving down and right but not making progress towards state 15. Maybe the policy is getting stuck in loops or going off track.

I notice that in the most recent policies, some are taking action 3 a lot. Action 3 has a mix of left, up, and right movements. But if the agent takes too many lefts, it might fall into holes on the left side of the grid.

To improve, perhaps I should focus on actions that increase the position towards state 15. For example, moving right (action 0) or down (action 2). But since the environment is slippery, each action has a chance to go in different directions.

Looking at the current best policies, they have some mixture of actions but might not be consistently pushing towards the goal. Maybe I need to adjust certain states' actions to encourage more right and down movements where possible.

For instance, state 0 (top-left corner) should probably move right or down. If action 1 is chosen, it can go right, left, or down. Similarly, for other starting states, choosing actions that have a higher probability of moving towards the goal would be better.

I also need to consider avoiding holes. From the trajectories, some agents are falling into holes like (8,2) or getting stuck in cycles. So, I should ensure that the policy doesn't lead the agent near these dangerous areas.

Perhaps for states closer to the goal, like state 13, choosing actions that push right or down would help reach state 15. For states on the edges, avoiding left movements could prevent falling into holes on the left side.

I think I'll adjust certain key states' actions. Maybe set state 0's action to 1 (which includes right), and other states near the bottom-right to push towards the goal. Also, ensure that from state 12 (bottom-left), the agent moves right instead of down or left, which could lead into a hole.

By making these adjustments, I can create a policy that avoids holes and increases the chances of reaching the goal, thereby improving the episodic reward.
