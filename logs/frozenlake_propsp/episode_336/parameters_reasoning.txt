You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to find the global optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment using this reinforcement learning approach. The goal is to reach state 15 with as many +1 rewards as possible, avoiding holes and falling into them.

First, let me understand the problem setup. The agent can take four actions: left (0), right (1), down (2), up (3). Each action has equal probability when in states where their respective directions are taken. For example, if I'm in a state where action 0 is chosen, there's a 1/3 chance to go left, and the other two actions have 1/6 each.

I see that the policy is parameterized by an array of size 16 (4x4 grid). Each element corresponds to a state (0-15) and specifies which action to take. My task is to choose values for these parameters from [0,1,2,3] such that the expected total reward from the starting state is maximized.

Looking at the examples provided, several parameter sets yield different rewards. For instance, some result in 1.0 reward, while others give lower values like 0.05 or even below zero. The optimal point seems to be around a certain configuration where the agent explores more thoroughly, avoiding traps and efficiently navigating the grid.

I think about the key states where the policy should avoid falling into holes. These are likely the states that have other states leading to them (holes). For example, if state 1 is part of a hole, then when the agent moves into it, it might yield a reward. However, I need to ensure the policy avoids these states.

Next, I consider how the policy should balance exploration and exploitation. Since rewards for certain actions can be negative (like stepping into a hole), the policy must sometimes explore other paths that lead to higher rewards or avoid traps.

But given the examples provided, it seems like policies with parameters around 2,3 might give better performance, as seen in some of the top-performing examples. However, I need to find if there's a more optimal configuration that can yield a higher reward consistently.

I also notice that using action 1 or 3 gives different options when on certain states. For example, action 1 allows moving right, which might be useful in reaching the goal. But sometimes, avoiding possible future moves (like traps) is better.

Considering the state transitions and rewards, I think a policy that maximizes the chances of choosing the optimal next action, especially in dangerous situations, would be beneficial. This suggests using parameters that encourage the agent to explore more when it's uncertain about which path leads to better outcomes.

However, since each parameter choice affects all possible paths from that state, I need a systematic way to determine the best set of values for these parameters. It might involve some mathematical analysis or simulation to see how different parameter combinations affect the expected reward.

Alternatively, using an optimization algorithm like gradient descent on the reward function could help find the optimal policy. But since this is a discrete choice (action 0-3), it's not straightforward to apply continuous optimization techniques directly.

Perhaps I can model this as a multi-objective problem where each state has multiple objectives corresponding to actions, and find a set of parameters that optimize these in a trade-off between immediate rewards and future potential.

Given the time constraints, maybe I'll try to adjust some parameters based on the examples provided. For instance, having action 2 (down) more often might help avoid traps, while action 3 (up) when necessary could still be useful. But without a clear method to determine this, it's tricky.

I decide to start by experimenting with parameter sets around 1 and 2 since they seem to balance some of the higher rewards against avoiding holes. For example, using parameters that allow taking action 1 or 3 more often in dangerous states could be beneficial. However, I might need to tweak these values experimentally before converging on a stable policy.
