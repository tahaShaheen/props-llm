You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help optimize a policy for the FrozenLake environment using reinforcement learning. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) with the highest possible reward, avoiding holes along the way. 

First, let me understand the problem better. The environment is a 4x4 grid where each state can be represented by a number from 0 to 15. Actions are slippery, meaning when you take an action, you might move in one of three directions with equal probability. For example, taking action 0 could result in moving down, left, or up.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 parameters (params), each representing the action to take from state 0 to state 15. The challenge is to find the optimal set of actions that maximizes the episodic reward, which should ideally be around 1.0 if we reach the goal without falling into a hole.

Looking at the provided data, the top-performing policies have f(params) values ranging from 0.20 to 0.30. These are relatively low, so there's room for improvement. The most recent policies all resulted in very low rewards (0.00), suggesting that those configurations might not be effective or could be leading into holes.

As an optimizer, my goal is to tweak the parameters to find a configuration that gets closer to 1.0. Since I'm stateless and can't remember previous attempts, each suggestion must maximize information gain by exploring new possibilities or slightly adjusting promising policies.

I notice that some of the top-performing params involve moving towards the right and down directions more often, which makes sense since the goal is at (3,3) corresponding to state 15. For example, action 0 includes moving down, left, or up, so choosing it from states where moving down would help progress closer to the goal might be beneficial.

Looking at the recent trajectories, some ended quickly in holes or didn't make progress, which means those policies aren't effective. To avoid this, I should adjust the actions in such a way that they either move towards the goal more directly or have higher probabilities of avoiding known holes.

One approach is to set actions for each state that primarily moves the agent right or down since these are the directions leading towards state 15. For example, states on the top row (0-3) should aim to move right towards state 3, then proceed downwards from there. Similarly, states on the left side (like state 0) might benefit from moving right to avoid getting stuck.

I also need to consider that each action choice leads to three possible moves with equal probability. So, even if the policy chooses a certain action, there's still uncertainty in where the agent will end up. Therefore, the policy should guide the agent towards actions that statistically increase the chance of reaching the goal without stepping into holes.

Given that the current top policies have an average reward around 0.30, I need to find configurations where the agent can reach the goal more consistently. Perhaps adjusting certain states' actions from what they were before could lead to better overall performance.

For instance, if in state 4 (second row, first column), instead of taking action 2 which might move up or right or down, maybe taking action 1 would be better as it can move right, down, or left. Moving right from state 4 leads to state 5, which is on the same row but one step closer to the goal.

Another consideration is to ensure that states near the goal have actions that directly lead towards it. For example, state 12 (third row, first column) should aim to move down towards state 13, then right towards 14 and finally to 15.

I'll also check if any of the recent policies had positive trajectories but low rewards because they fell into a hole. By adjusting their actions slightly, perhaps I can find a configuration that avoids those holes while still moving towards the goal.

In summary, my approach is to:

1. Focus on setting actions in each state that primarily move towards the right or down.
2. Ensure that states near the goal have actions leading directly towards it.
3. Slightly adjust the best-performing policies from previous iterations to refine their reward.
4. Avoid configurations that lead into holes by ensuring actions don't trap the agent.

Now, I'll propose a new set of params based on these considerations.
