You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help optimize the policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get the agent from any starting state to state 15 with as high a reward as possible. The tricky part is that each action has a 33% chance of moving in one of three directions due to the slippery nature of the grid.

Looking at the problem, I know that the best possible reward is around 1.0, which means reaching the goal consistently. From the examples provided, it seems like most policies are getting low rewards, around 0.2 to 0.3 on average, so there's definitely room for improvement.

In the recent attempts, some trajectories ended quickly either by falling into holes or not making progress towards the goal. For instance, one trajectory started at state 0 and took action 1, which could move it down, left, or up. It moved to state 4, then to state 8, but didn't reach the goal.

Another thing I notice is that some policies are getting stuck in loops, like staying on state 0 repeatedly or moving between a few states without making progress. That suggests that the current policy isn't effectively guiding the agent towards the goal.

I need to come up with a new set of parameters that explore different paths. Maybe changing the actions for certain states can help avoid holes and guide the agent more directly towards the goal. For example, if state 0 is taking action 1 (right), but that might lead it into a hole, perhaps switching to a different action could be better.

I should consider each state individually and decide which action would most likely move the agent closer to state 15 while avoiding holes. Since the environment is slippery, each action choice has uncertainty, so the policy needs to balance exploration and exploitation effectively.

Looking at the grid layout, state 0 is top-left (0,0). From here, possible moves are down, left, or up, but since it's on the edge, moving left or up would go out of bounds. So action 1 from state 0 could move to state 4 (down), 3 (left?), or maybe another state? Wait, I think each grid has four adjacent states except edges.

Wait, perhaps the movement is such that when you try to move left from state 0 (which is in column 0 of row 0), it wraps around or stays. But according to the problem description, moving left from 0 might go to state 3 because it's the same row but next column? Or does it stay?

Actually, I think each action leads to three possible states with equal probability, considering the slippery nature. So for each state and action, there are three possible next states.

For example, taking action 0 (which is [down, left, up]) from state 0: down would go to state 4 (same column in row 1), left would maybe stay in state 0 if it's the edge? Or perhaps move to a hole or another state. Similarly for up.

I think I need to map out all possible transitions for each state and action. But without knowing where exactly the holes are, except that certain states are holes, it's tricky.

But since the user has access to previous trajectories, they can infer which actions lead to holes based on failed attempts. So in previous tries, if an action from a state leads to a hole often, perhaps we should avoid that action.

In the most recent params, for example, some states had actions leading to immediate falls into holes. So I need to ensure that for each state and action, none of the possible next steps lead to a hole, or at least minimize that risk.

Wait, no, because it's probabilistic. The agent has a chance to step on a hole when taking certain actions, but not necessarily every time. So maybe some states have a higher probability of leading to holes based on their action choices.

Looking at the top 5 best params, the highest reward was 0.3, which is still low. So perhaps the current policies aren't effectively navigating towards the goal or are getting stuck too often.

I need to design a policy that pushes the agent towards state 15 as efficiently as possible while avoiding holes. Maybe setting actions that generally move the agent down and right since those directions would lead closer to the goal.

For example, in state 0 (top-left), taking action 2 might move the agent down or right with some probability. Alternatively, choosing an action that tends to move towards the goal more often.

I think I'll need to set each state's action to a direction that has the highest chance of moving closer to state 15, considering possible slippery movements.

But since it's a grid, perhaps using a greedy approach where each state chooses an action that moves it towards the goal on average. For example, states in the top-left would choose right or down, while states near the bottom-right might choose up or left if they're close to the goal.

Alternatively, maybe setting all states to move right when possible and down otherwise could create a path that leads towards the goal more directly.

However, since each action is probabilistic, it's not guaranteed. So perhaps the policy needs to have a mix of actions that cover multiple paths towards the goal, thereby increasing the chance of eventually reaching it.

I think a good starting point would be to set all states except those near the goal to move right or down, depending on their position, and the states closer to the goal can adjust accordingly.

Wait, but since each action leads to three possible directions, maybe choosing actions that have a higher probability of moving towards the goal in general. For instance, for state 0, taking an action that moves down (towards row 1) or right (towards column 1).

Alternatively, perhaps setting all states to take action 2, which allows movement up, right, or down. This might cover more directions and have a higher chance of eventually reaching the goal.

But without knowing where the holes are exactly, it's hard to say which actions are safe. So maybe I need to choose actions that minimize the risk of falling into holes based on previous trajectories.

Looking at the recent attempts, some states had actions leading to immediate falls. For example, state 0 taking action 3 (which allows left, up, right) might lead to a hole in certain cases. So perhaps avoiding action 3 for state 0 and choosing another action instead.

In summary, I need to propose a new set of params that differs from previous ones, explores different paths, avoids falling into holes more effectively, and increases the chance of reaching the goal.
