You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

Do NOT output anything else. No explanation, no reasoning, nothing.

<think>
Okay, let's break down how I approached this problem step by step.

First, I needed to understand the environment thoroughly. The FrozenLake is a 4x4 grid where the agent moves with actions that have equal probabilities of going in three directions due to being slippery. The goal is state 15 (bottom-right corner), and there are holes that end the episode if stepped on.

The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers, each indicating the action for a specific state. My task was to find the optimal policy that maximizes the reward, which should be around 1.0 when successful.

Looking at the provided top params and their rewards, I noticed that most had low rewards (around 0.25 or less). This suggested that the current policies aren't effective enough. The recent trials also showed similar issues, with some policies even getting zero reward, possibly because they fell into holes repeatedly.

Since the average reward is far below 1.0, I adopted an exploration strategy as per the stateless approach. My goal was to maximize information gain by choosing a new policy that's distinct from previous ones to uncover new trajectories and potential paths to the goal.

I decided to create a completely different policy where each state has a unique action, ensuring maximum diversity in movement patterns. This helps identify which states might be leading to holes and which path could reach the goal.

For example, I set params[0] to 1 (right), which is different from previous top policies that often used action 2 or others. This move aims to push the agent towards state 3 (from state 0) instead of other directions. Similarly, varying actions for each state ensures that the agent doesn't get stuck in loops and has a higher chance of reaching new areas.

By proposing this diverse policy, I aimed to gather more data on which states are safe and effective, allowing future iterations to optimize based on these new insights.
