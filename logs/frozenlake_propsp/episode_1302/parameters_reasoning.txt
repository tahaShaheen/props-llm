You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help optimize the policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get the agent from the start (state 0) to state 15 with the highest reward possible, which should be around 1.0 if we find the optimal path.

First, I need to understand the environment better. It's a 4x4 grid, and each cell can transition in multiple directions because of the slippery nature—each action leads to three possible next states with equal probability. The agent can move left, right, up, or down, but due to slipping, there's uncertainty in where it ends up.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 elements (params[0] to params[15]), each representing the action taken when in that state. The actions are 0-3, corresponding to specific movement options as described. However, because of the slipping, choosing an action doesn't guarantee moving in a certain direction; instead, there's a spread of possible next states.

Looking at the top-performing policies and their rewards, I see that the highest reward so far is around 0.45, which is significantly below the target of 1.0. This suggests that the current strategies are not efficiently navigating to state 15 or are falling into holes too often.

In the recent iterations, the agent has tried various policies but hasn't yet achieved the optimal reward. The trajectories show that some policies get stuck in loops or end up in holes quickly. For example, one trajectory kept going back and forth between states without making progress towards state 15, resulting in a reward of 0.0.

To move closer to the global optimum, I need to consider policies that can navigate more directly towards state 15 while avoiding holes. Since the agent has limited memory and is stateless, each proposed policy must be based solely on maximizing information gain for future iterations.

Given that previous attempts have shown a tendency to either get stuck or fall into traps, perhaps adjusting certain states' actions could help. For example, maybe changing the action in state 14 (which is just above state 15) from 3 to another direction might increase the chance of reaching the goal.

I should also consider which states are near the goal and how their policies influence the path. States closer to the end should have actions that push towards state 15, even if there's some randomness due to slipping.

Another thought: maybe certain states near the edges or corners need specific action assignments to avoid falling into holes. For example, state 0 (top-left) might benefit from an action that tries to move right rather than up or left since moving left would take it out of bounds or into a hole if there's one there.

I should generate a new policy that varies from the previous ones but still focuses on moving towards state 15. Perhaps tweaking some actions in key states, like those near the goal, could yield better rewards.

After considering all these factors, I decide to propose a new set of parameters where certain critical states have their actions adjusted to push more towards the goal and avoid traps. This should help increase the reward by improving the path's efficiency.
