You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to help find the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment using this reinforcement learning setup. The goal is to reach state 15, which is the bottom right corner, and maximize the reward by avoiding holes. The agent can move left, down, right, or up, but when it takes an action, each direction has equal probability except for certain actions that have higher probabilities.

First, I need to understand how the policy is represented. It's a function where each state (from 0 to 15) maps to an action (0-3). The current params are an array of these values. My task is to choose values from [0,1,2,3] for each parameter to maximize the expected reward over time.

Looking at the top-performing parameters provided in the examples, I notice that using 2 for actions 0 and 2 seems common because they have higher probabilities when certain states are reached. For instance, action 0 is often chosen as it's part of the up move strategy, which helps avoid stepping on holes by moving down or right.

However, some parameters like action 3 (down) or action 1 (right/down/left) might be better in specific states to ensure exploration without risking falling into a hole. The top example where action 0 is chosen for state 0 and state 1 suggests that avoiding holes requires careful planning around the edges.

I should consider the dynamics of the grid. State 0 is at the top-left, so moving down from there will lead to state 4 (top-right). If I don't take action 3 from state 0, the agent might end up on a hole or being pushed off the grid. Thus, it's crucial to balance between exploitation (choosing known good actions) and exploration (testing new paths around holes).

Since the agent should explore through trajectories when stepping into holes, but avoid falling by choosing safe actions. The policy needs to ensure that the agent doesn't step on any hole states (other than 15). Each time an action is taken, it's part of the path, so if a hole is stepped upon, the episode ends with a reward of -1 for each state except 15, which gives +1.

I should also consider that taking certain actions when in specific states can lead to more opportunities for exploration. For example, from some positions, choosing action 3 (down) might provide immediate access to new areas without risking stepping on holes unless necessary.

Given the parameters are a mix of 0 and 2, which correspond to up/down moves, perhaps it's beneficial to use these more often when avoiding immediate risks. However, action 1 allows for exploration by including right, down, and left, which can be useful in the middle areas where stepping on a hole might occur.

I need to test various combinations, especially ones that encourage going around holes while still exploring new paths. Using action 0 (up) more often from certain states could help avoid immediate collisions with holes, but also explore neighboring areas when necessary.

Considering all this, I think the optimal policy would involve choosing action 2 (down) as much as possible in safe regions and sometimes taking action 3 (down) to reach new areas without risk. This balance should allow exploration of paths that might lead to avoiding holes, while still being guided towards the goal state.
