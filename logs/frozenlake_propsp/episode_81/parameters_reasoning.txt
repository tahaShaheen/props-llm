You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 81 out of 5000. OUTPUT ONLY THIS SINGLE LINE:

Do NOT output anything else. No explanation, no reasoning, nothing.



LLM:
<think>
Alright, I need to figure out the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment based on the given information. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward by reaching state 15 without falling into any holes. 

First, let's understand the environment. It's a 4x4 grid where each cell represents a state from 0 to 15. The agent can move in four directions, but due to slipperiness, each action leads to three possible next states with equal probability. Holes are present which end the episode if stepped on.

The policy is an array of 16 actions (0-3) for each state. My task is to propose a new set of parameters that either explores new possibilities or optimizes around the current best, depending on the reward history.

Looking at the provided data, all top-performing policies have rewards around 0.10, which is far below the target of 1.0. This suggests we're in the exploration phase (Explorer mode), so I should propose a completely new set of parameters that haven't been tried before to gather more information.

I need to ensure each state's action doesn't lead to any holes. For example, states near the edges might have higher risks, so choosing actions that move towards the goal while avoiding dangerous areas is crucial.

Let me draft a possible policy where each state moves right or down when possible, but considering the slippery nature. Maybe state 0 (top-left) should move right, state 1 could move down, and so on, trying to navigate towards state 15 without getting stuck in loops or holes.

Wait, I need to make sure that for each action choice, none of the next states are holes. Since hole locations aren't specified, perhaps the safest bet is to have a deterministic policy that avoids edges where possible. Alternatively, maybe some states should move in multiple directions to increase the chance of reaching the goal without falling.

Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about the hole positions, but from the trajectories, it seems moving right and down are common actions towards the goal. So perhaps setting most policies to move right or down when possible would be a good start.

Let me create a policy where each state i chooses an action that generally moves towards the right or down unless in a position where another direction is safer or more direct. For example, states in the bottom row should try moving right, and those on the far right might move up or down to avoid falling into holes.

After considering these factors, I'll propose a new set of parameters where each state selects actions that balance between moving towards the goal and avoiding risky moves based on prior trajectories.
