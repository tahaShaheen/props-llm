You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to find the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment using a neural network-based policy optimizer. The problem is about navigating a grid where each state can be in one of 16 positions (0-15). The agent has four possible actions: left, right, down, or up. 

The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it doesn't always go to the intended direction. Instead, for certain actions, there's a chance of moving in other directions. For example, taking action 0 (down) has equal probability among moving down, left, and up. Similarly, each action leads to three possible moves with equal likelihood.

The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner), which gives the highest reward of +1. All other states give a reward of 0 except for some holes in the map, which end the game. The challenge here is that there are unknown states where stepping on them could lead to failure, and the agent must explore these areas through previous trajectories.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 numbers, each corresponding to one state (from 0 to 15). Each number in this array represents the action to take when in that state. The value for each parameter (params[i]) is selected from [0, 1, 2, 3], and these parameters will be adjusted during training.

The goal is to maximize the episodic reward f(params) at each iteration. Since there are holes, it's crucial to explore areas where states might lead to failure, so the agent should avoid revisiting previously seen states unless necessary.

To begin, I need to set up a function that evaluates the current policy based on the params array and simulates the agent's behavior from the initial state (0) until it either reaches the goal or falls into a hole. The reward obtained during these simulations will give an estimate of how good the current policy is. This estimated value can then be used to guide the optimization process by adjusting the parameters to improve future policies.

However, simulating each possible path from state 0 might be computationally intensive, especially since it's a small grid (4x4). To make this manageable, I'll set up a simulation function that runs multiple episodes of the agent's exploration. Each episode starts at state 0 and follows the current policy to see how far it gets before either hitting a hole or reaching the goal.

During these simulations, I'll record not just the final reward but also metrics like whether the agent successfully reached the goal. This information will help me evaluate the quality of different policies by providing an average score across multiple episodes. The average success rate and the total reward can serve as indicators to determine if a policy is effective or needs improvement.

Once I have this evaluation data, I'll use it to adjust the params array using an optimization method. Since each parameter's value is in [0, 1, 2, 3], one approach could be to sample points around the current best and evaluate their performance. This iterative process will gradually refine the policy parameters to find a configuration that maximizes the expected reward.

I also need to ensure that my simulation correctly follows the current policy without relying on external data. Each step of the agent should follow the selected action according to its probability distribution, regardless of previous simulations. If the agent ever falls into a hole, it stops immediately with zero reward for that episode.

Given that the exploration isn't too extensive (since each state needs to be explored multiple times), I can run enough episodes to get a reliable estimate of how well different policies perform. This might involve running 100-200 episodes per simulation to reduce variance and obtain an average reward as a measure.

After evaluating several candidate policy parameterizations, I'll select the one that yields the highest average reward across all episodes. However, if no single parameter set consistently achieves high rewards (e.g., around 0.15 or lower), it's important to continue exploring different combinations until a promising solution is found.
