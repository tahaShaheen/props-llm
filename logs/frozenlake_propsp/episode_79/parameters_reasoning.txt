You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get the highest possible reward by reaching state 15 without falling into any holes. From the problem description, I know that each action taken by the agent has a 33% chance of going in three different directions because the environment is slippery.

Looking at the provided data, all the top-performing policies are yielding around 0.10 reward on average, which is much lower than the target of 1.0. This suggests that none of these policies have been able to reach the goal consistently yet. The trajectories show that many agents either fall into holes or get stuck in loops without reaching the goal.

I remember that in state 7, there's a hole at position (2,3), and similarly, some other states like (1,0) might be dangerous. So, the policy needs to avoid actions that lead the agent into these holes while still trying to move towards the goal at state 15.

In the most recent policies tried, they all ended up with trajectories that didn't reach the goal or fell into holes. For example, one trajectory went from (0,3) through several states and ended without reaching the goal. Another stayed in place or moved back and forth, which isn't helpful.

Since the rewards are still low, I should act as an Explorer and try out new policies that haven't been tried before. Maybe adjusting certain actions in key states can help avoid holes and find a path to the goal more effectively.

Looking at state 0 (top-left corner), if the agent takes action 3 (right or up or down with equal probability), it might have a better chance of moving towards the right, which is generally the direction of the goal. Similarly, in state 15, since that's the goal, I should make sure that any actions there are set to stay or something, but wait, state 15 is terminal, so maybe we don't need to set anything for it.

I think a good strategy would be to have each policy attempt to move right or down as much as possible because those directions lead towards the goal. But considering the slippery nature, the agent might drift in other directions, so the policy should account for that by having multiple paths.

Looking at state 0 (params[0]), I'll set it to action 3. This way, from the top-left corner, the agent can move right, down, or up with equal chance. But since moving down takes it closer to the bottom-right goal, this might help.

For state 1 (top-middle), setting params[1] to 2 could mean the agent tries to move up, right, or down. Moving right would take it towards the goal, so that's a good direction.

Continuing this logic, I'll set each state's action such that it has a higher chance of moving towards either right or down. But since the environment is slippery, sometimes the agent might drift left or up, so the policy needs to be robust.

I also need to ensure that in states near holes, the actions don't lead into them. For example, in state 12 (which is one row above the bottom-left corner), moving down would take it into a hole, so perhaps setting params[12] to avoid certain directions could help.

But since I'm supposed to propose a single new policy without knowing previous ones, I'll focus on creating a policy where each state's action encourages movement towards the goal while considering possible drifts.

After thinking through this, here's a tentative plan: set each state's action to one that has a higher chance of moving right or down. For example, params[i] = 2 for states where moving up might be risky, and so on. But without exact knowledge of which states are holes, it's tricky.

Given the problem statement, I know the holes are at certain positions, but not exactly where. So, perhaps setting a policy that generally moves towards the right and down can help avoid them or navigate around.

After considering all this, here's a possible set of parameters where each state is assigned an action that pushes it towards the goal direction while trying to minimize the chance of falling into holes.
