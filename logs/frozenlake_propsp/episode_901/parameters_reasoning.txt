You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 901 out of 5000. OUTPUT ONLY THIS SINGLE LINE:
params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W
Do NOT output anything else. No explanation, no reasoning, nothing.



LLM:
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with a reward of +1, and avoid the holes which end the episode. Since it's slippery, each action can lead to three possible directions with equal probability.

Looking at the top 5 best performing params, most have f(params) around 0.35-0.45, which is lower than the target of 1.0. This suggests that none of these policies are yet optimal. The trajectories show that agents often fall into loops or get stuck near holes.

In the recent trials, several params led to immediate falls into holes (like f(params) = 0.00). So, I need to find a policy that avoids these traps. Maybe focusing on states near the edges where falling into a hole is more likely would help.

I notice in some top params, actions like moving right or down are chosen for certain states. Perhaps adjusting these to prioritize safer moves could improve performance. For example, if a state is near a hole, choosing an action that moves away might prevent falls.

Since we're at iteration 901, and the rewards are still low, I should act as an Explorer by trying new configurations distinct from previous ones. Maybe changing some key states' actions to different values could help discover better paths or avoid holes.

I'll consider modifying the policy for certain critical states, especially those near the bottom right where the goal is located. For instance, state 14 (third column of the third row) might benefit from a specific action that increases the chance of moving towards 15 without risk.

After considering all this, I'll propose a new set of params where some actions are changed to avoid known dangerous paths and increase the likelihood of reaching the goal.
