You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me start by understanding the problem thoroughly.

The environment is a 4x4 grid where each state can be represented as a number from 0 to 15. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) and get a reward of +1, while avoiding holes which end the episode with no reward. The agent's movement is slippery, meaning when it takes an action, it has a 33% chance of moving in one of three directions.

The policy is defined by an array 'params' where each element corresponds to the action taken in that state (0-15). Each params[i] can be 0, 1, 2, or 3, representing left, down, right, and up actions respectively. However, because of the slipperiness, each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability.

Looking at the previous interactions and trajectories provided, I notice that the average rewards are quite low, around 0.30 and below. The optimal reward should be around 1.0, so there's room for improvement. 

In the most recent trials, many policies resulted in very low or zero rewards, indicating that the agent is either falling into holes frequently or not reaching the goal efficiently. For example, some trajectories loop endlessly without progress, and others end quickly by hitting a hole.

To maximize information gain and move closer to the optimal reward, I need to propose a policy that either explores new areas of the state space (if rewards are low) or fine-tunes promising policies (if rewards are approaching 1.0). Since current rewards are still below 1.0, especially around 0.30, it suggests we're in the exploration phase.

I should look for a policy that directs the agent towards the goal while avoiding known holes. From the top-performing params provided earlier, some states have actions leading closer to state 15. For example, if the agent is near the bottom row, moving right or down would be beneficial. Conversely, in other areas, directing towards the center might help.

I also need to ensure that the proposed policy hasn't been tried before. Looking at the recent params, I can see some patterns and try to vary them. Maybe changing certain actions from their current settings could lead the agent into different trajectories, helping identify safer paths or better reward opportunities.

One approach is to make sure that in key positions (like near the goal), the policy encourages movements directly towards it. For instance, state 14 should probably move right to reach state 15, and state 8 might benefit from moving down or right.

I also notice that some trajectories get stuck in loops, like state 0 repeatedly being visited. To avoid this, the policy should encourage movement away from such loops unless they are part of a safe path towards the goal.

Given all this, I'll construct a new 'params' array where each state is assigned an action that either moves closer to the goal or avoids known holes based on prior trajectories. Since I can't remember previous attempts due to being stateless, I have to base my choices purely on maximizing information gain by selecting actions that could potentially lead to higher rewards.

I'll aim for a policy where states near the edges and bottom are set to move towards the goal, while other states might direct towards the center or safer zones. For example:

- States in row 3 (12-15) should mainly move right towards state 15.
- States in column 3 (3,7,11,15) should move down if possible to reach the goal.
- Avoiding holes might require certain states to choose actions that lead away from known hole positions.

After considering these factors, I'll propose a new 'params' configuration. For instance, setting state 0 to move right (action 2), which can help in navigating towards the goal without immediately getting stuck. Similarly, adjusting other states accordingly to avoid loops and direct towards the goal.
