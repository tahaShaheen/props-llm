You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so the user is asking about optimizing a policy in the FrozenLake environment using an RL approach. They've provided a lot of details, including the environment setup, the reward structure, and several examples of parameter values along with their corresponding rewards.

First, I need to understand what they're trying to achieve. It seems like they want me to find the optimal policy parameters (params[0] through params[15]) that maximize the episodic reward in this environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with a reward of +1 and avoid holes which end the game.

I remember that the policy is represented by an array where each element corresponds to a state (from 0 to 15). So, params[0] determines how the agent behaves when it's in state 0. The values are chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3], and the goal is to find the best combination of these that leads to the highest reward.

Looking at the examples provided, I see that some parameters result in a reward of 1.00, which suggests they're on the path towards the goal but might be stuck or encountering holes. Others have lower rewards like 0.25 and 0.30. The most recent example with f(params)=0.00 indicates that the agent is getting worse, so it's not improving.

I also notice that all examples are either in state 1-4 (top row) or some middle states but don't seem to be near the bottom right corner where the hole might be. So, maybe the holes are elsewhere, or perhaps the user wants the policy to avoid them by choosing actions wisely.

Since the agent should explore past seen examples and pick actions that avoid holes, I think the key is to ensure that when in states with holes (probably states 7-15), the policy avoids stepping on them. But how?

The policy's current parameters might be stuck near the hole without exploration, leading to worse rewards. So, perhaps increasing some of the params around state 14 could help, as it's the goal. Also, ensuring that certain actions lead towards the end states.

Another thought is about the transition probabilities when taking action 2. The user mentioned that when in any state, taking action 2 (up, down, or left/right) with equal probability can explore more thoroughly. Maybe increasing params[2] could encourage exploration beyond the given examples.

I also wonder if using an epsilon-greedy strategy where some randomness is added to avoid getting stuck near the hole states. However, since the policy needs deterministic actions based on state, I might have to adjust the parameters in a way that balances exploitation and exploration.

In summary, I think the optimal approach would involve adjusting params[0], [1], and [2] to encourage movement towards the goal while also allowing some lateral exploration (action 2). This should help avoid holes and find a path through the grid more effectively.
