You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment using an agent-based approach. The goal is to reach state 15 (the right bottom grid) which gives a reward of +1, while all other states give 0. However, there are some holes that can trap the agent if it steps into them. 

The policy parameters are given as an array where each element represents the action taken when in a specific state. The values can be 0 to 3, and each corresponds to a different direction or action. From the problem statement, I understand that the value of params[i] determines the action at state i.

Since the policy is represented by these parameters, which are initialized as [1, 1, 1, 1], I need to find values for each parameter between 0 and 3 that maximize the total reward. The challenge here is to balance exploration (trying different actions) with exploitation (choosing the best-known action).

I think a good starting point would be to use an epsilon-greedy strategy where we sometimes explore by choosing random actions, but primarily exploit the best-known action. This helps in finding a good policy without getting stuck in local optima.

I remember that in reinforcement learning, techniques like Q-learning or SARSA are commonly used for this purpose. However, since all states and transitions can be precomputed, maybe I don't need to simulate each episode but instead use the given parameters as starting points.

Wait, the problem mentions that the global optimal reward is around None if not found. So my goal is to approach that value, ideally finding a policy that allows me to reach the goal without getting stuck in holes.

I think the best way to start is by setting all parameters to 1 initially, which means always taking action 1 (right or down or left, considering the specific state transitions). But perhaps this leads to some issues if it doesn't explore enough. So maybe I should set a higher epsilon to encourage exploration, but I'm not sure how to choose the right value.

Looking at the provided top performing params, they have values ranging from 0 to 3 across different states. For instance, params[0] can be 2 or 1, and params[4] is 1, which might mean taking a specific action when in state (0, 2). 

I also notice that some parameters are consistently 0, others 1, 2, or 3. It seems like the optimal policy would involve choosing actions that avoid getting trapped by holes but still allow for efficient exploration towards the goal.

Perhaps I should set params to values that encourage the agent to explore more in certain areas while sticking strongly to others. For example, maybe having a mix of 0 and higher numbers ensures both immediate exploitation (for faster learning) and occasional random choices (exploration).

I'm also considering if any specific action patterns are better. For instance, sometimes taking action 2 (up, right, down) or action 3 (left, up, right) might be more efficient in avoiding holes. 

But without simulating each possible policy's performance, it's hard to decide exactly which parameters will work best. However, based on the provided top results, some actions are consistently better than others across different states. Maybe setting all params higher would encourage more exploration and avoid getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps starting with a uniform distribution (all params set to 1) is a safe bet that allows for both exploitation and exploration, and then fine-tuning via iterative improvement can get closer to the optimal policy.

I think I should try setting parameters in a way that balances these two aspects. Maybe using a higher epsilon like 0.2 or 0.5 could help encourage some randomness without making it too computationally expensive. But since we're limited to four values (each between 0 and 3), perhaps each parameter can be adjusted independently, but I'm not sure how that would balance exploration vs exploitation.

Another approach is to use a learning algorithm like Q-learning with epsilon-greedy exploration. In this method, the agent chooses the best-known action most of the time but occasionally explores by choosing a random action. This should allow it to learn better while avoiding local optima.

I'm also considering that in the provided examples, some parameters lead to lower rewards, so I need to make sure that my policy is designed to maximize those. The holes complicate things because the agent might get stuck if it falls into them, so the policy needs to avoid such states as much as possible.

In summary, I think starting with a uniform action selection (params all set to 1) and then using an epsilon-greedy approach could be a good strategy. Adjusting epsilon and possibly fine-tuning based on performance will help in finding the optimal policy that maximizes the reward while exploring efficiently.
