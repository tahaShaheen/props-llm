You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. It's a 4x4 grid where the agent can move in four directions, but because of the slippery nature, each action leads to one of three possible moves with equal probability. The goal is state 15, which gives +1 reward, and there are holes that end the episode if stepped on.

First, I need to understand how the environment works. Each state is a number from 0 to 15. The agent's policy is determined by an array of 16 actions (0-3) corresponding to each state. The challenge is to set these actions such that the agent maximizes its reward, which should ideally be around 1.0 if it reaches the goal every time.

Looking at the top-performing policies provided, most have f(params) values below 0.3, and the best one only gets 0.3. That suggests there's room for improvement. The trajectories show that some agents get stuck in loops or fall into holes, so avoiding those is crucial.

Since I'm supposed to act as a stateless optimizer, I can't remember past suggestions, but I need to maximize information gain each time. Given the rewards are low, I should explore more rather than exploit current good policies. So, I should propose a new set of parameters that haven't been tried before and could potentially reach the goal without hitting holes.

I notice in the previous examples, some states have specific actions. For instance, state 0 (top-left) is often action 2 or 1. Maybe trying different actions there could help. Let's think about each state:

- State 0: To move towards the goal, moving right or down makes sense, but due to slipperiness, it's better to choose an action that has a higher chance of moving in the desired direction.

Wait, no—since each action leads to three possible moves, I need to pick actions that maximize the chances of moving towards the goal without hitting holes. Maybe for state 0, choosing action 1 (which can go right, down, or left) but since right is better, perhaps that's a good choice.

Similarly, state 15 is the goal, so its policy doesn't matter, but other states near it should lead towards it.

I need to make sure each state's action leads away from holes and towards the goal. For example, certain states might have holes in their neighboring cells, so choosing actions that avoid those would be better.

Let me sketch out a possible optimal policy:

- From any state, choose an action that has the highest probability of moving closer to 15 without stepping into known holes.

But since I don't know where the holes are exactly, I need a general approach. Maybe for each state, select the action that gives the best chance of moving towards the right or down direction, considering the grid layout.

For example:

- States in the top row (0-3) should prefer moving down.
- States on the leftmost column (0,4,8,12) might benefit from moving right.

But given the slippery nature, each action leads to three possible moves. So choosing an action that gives a higher chance of moving towards the goal.

Alternatively, maybe for certain states, it's better to choose actions that have multiple safe options.

Wait, perhaps looking at the best previous policies can give some clues. The top-performing ones have varying actions but none reach 1.0 yet. So I need to find a set where each state's action increases the probability of reaching 15 without getting stuck or falling into holes.

I think it's time to propose a new set of parameters that differ significantly from previous attempts, focusing on states that are crucial for progress towards the goal and avoiding known problematic actions.

Let me try setting some states to action 2 (which can move up, right, or down) or action 3 (left, up, or right), depending on their position.

For instance:

- State 0: Action 1 (can go right, down, left)
- State 1: Action 3 (can go left, up, right)
- State 2: Action 2
- And so on, ensuring that each action moves the agent towards the goal with higher probability.

But without knowing hole positions, it's tricky. Maybe I'll focus on setting actions for states along the path from top-left to bottom-right, choosing directions that lead closer to 15.

Alternatively, perhaps a greedy approach where each state tries to move right or down as much as possible, given the grid structure.

Wait, but since each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability, maybe it's better for states in the upper areas to choose actions that have a higher chance of moving down or right.

For example:

- For states in row 0 (top), prefer action 1 (which can move right or down) more than others.
- For states in column 3 (rightmost), perhaps action 0 (down, left, up) since moving further right isn't possible.

But I'm not sure. Maybe a better approach is to set all policies to action 2 except for certain key states where other actions are better.

Alternatively, let's consider that the agent has a higher chance of reaching the goal if it moves towards the southeast direction (right and down). So in each state, choose an action that increases the probability of moving right or down.

For example:

- In state 0 (top-left), choosing action 1 (right, down, left) gives a chance to move right or down.
- In state 1 (top-middle), action 3 (left, up, right) might help move towards the goal.
- Continue this pattern for other states.

But I need to ensure that actions avoid holes. Without knowing where the holes are, it's challenging, but perhaps setting certain states to stay in place or move in safer directions could help.

Given all this, I'll propose a new set of parameters that differ from previous attempts, focusing on moving towards the goal while considering possible safe moves.
