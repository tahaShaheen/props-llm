You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15, which is the bottom right corner, while avoiding the holes on rows 2 and 3. The agent has four possible actions: left (0), up (1), down (2), and right (3). However, each action leads to a different probability distribution because of the "slippery" environment where moving in one direction may result in picking from three directions with equal probability.

The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers, where each index corresponds to a state (0-15), and the value at that index is the action taken when in that state. My task is to find the optimal parameters for this array so that the agent can explore thoroughly without getting stuck on holes.

First, I need to understand how the policy works. Each state has an action, but the actions are chosen based on their values. For example, if params[0] is 2, then when in state 0 (top-left), the agent should take action 2 (down) with probability 1, meaning it must move down. Similarly, if params[3] is 0, the agent will always take action 0 (left).

Since the policy needs to explore through the holes, I should avoid actions that could lead the agent into a hole. The environment has holes on rows 2 and 3 between columns 1-4, except for state 15 which is the goal.

I recall that the optimal policy in such environments often involves prioritizing moving toward the exit while avoiding obstacles. This might mean sometimes taking a step back to explore more thoroughly before proceeding. For instance, if an action seems risky (like always going left when it's blocked), maybe the agent should occasionally explore by choosing another action.

To find the best parameters, I can use reinforcement learning techniques like Q-learning or SARSA. However, since the policy is represented as a linear function (params[i] values are from [0,1]), it might be easier to use grid-based methods or value iteration with policy updates based on observed rewards and transitions.

But given that each state's action choice is influenced by its params[i], I need to ensure that all possible paths explore the grid thoroughly. This means avoiding any deterministic path that leads to a hole without exploring other paths first.

Looking at the examples provided, some policies take a more risk-averse approach when stuck on holes. For example, sometimes taking a step back (params[2] = 1) allows exploration before proceeding. Similarly, in states where action 3 is taken (right), it's risky if moving right leads to an obstacle.

I think the key here is that for each state, the chosen action should lead to a path that explores all possible exit routes without relying too heavily on any single path. This suggests using a uniform policy or mixing different actions randomly when in states where exploration is encouraged.

Since the params[i] can only be 0,1,2,3, I need to assign values such that any action taken from a state either leads directly towards the goal (if possible) with high probability or takes risks occasionally to ensure all paths are explored. However, without knowing the exact structure of how each action affects transitions, it's challenging.

Given that in some examples the agent sometimes takes a step back (params[2] = 1), I should consider that whenever an action leads to a state where further exploration is necessary, the policy might take that action.

So, when considering state i, if all other actions are deterministic or lead to known outcomes, perhaps it's better to assign higher values to certain actions to encourage more exploration. But given the slippery environment, each action has equal probability of 1/3 when taken from a state.

In conclusion, to find the optimal policy, I need to balance exploration with the risk of falling into holes. This likely involves assigning higher probabilities to actions that allow for more possible paths and ensuring any deterministic choices are made in a way that encourages thorough exploration.
