You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get an average reward of around 1.0, which would mean the agent reaches state 15 most of the time without falling into any holes.

Looking at the recent params and their rewards, it seems like the policies are not performing very well yet. Most have f(params) below 0.45, with some even getting zero or just a tiny bit. The top-performing ones average around 0.35-0.45. Since these aren't close to 1.0, I think I should be in "Explorer" mode, meaning I need to try out new configurations rather than tweaking the existing ones.

From the trajectories provided, it looks like the agent is often getting stuck or not moving towards the goal efficiently. For example, some policies get stuck in loops or move away from the goal state. So maybe the current policies aren't effectively navigating the slippery environment or avoiding the holes.

I need to find a policy that can reliably navigate towards state 15 without stepping into any holes. Since the environment is slippery, each action has a 33% chance of going in three different directions. This means that the policy needs to be robust against these stochastic movements.

Looking at some of the recent policies, they might not be taking optimal paths or may be choosing actions that lead near the holes more often. To improve this, I should consider changing the actions for certain states to avoid risky moves and guide the agent towards safer, goal-oriented paths.

Perhaps setting up a deterministic path towards state 15 by making sure each state's action leads closer to the goal when possible. For example, if the agent is in state 0 (top-left corner), moving right or down could be better because those directions are towards the goal. But considering the slippery nature, maybe choosing an action that has a higher chance of moving in the desired direction.

Also, I should ensure that the policy doesn't lead the agent into any holes. For instance, states around the edges might have holes, so the actions chosen must avoid leading there. Maybe mapping out which states are holes would help, but since I don't have that information, I need to infer based on trajectories.

Looking at one of the top policies: params[0]: 1; params[1]:3; etc., with a reward of 0.45. That policy took a trajectory (0,1) -> (4,2) -> (8,2). Maybe adjusting some actions in states that are leading away or into risky areas could improve the reward.

Another approach is to try policies where each state's action pushes the agent towards the goal as much as possible, considering the possible movements. For example, using right and down actions when possible, but since the environment is slippery, choosing actions that have a higher chance of moving in those directions.

I should also consider if some states are more dangerous than others. For instance, maybe certain columns or rows have more holes, so avoiding them by taking different paths could help.

Overall, I think changing a few key actions in critical states to guide the agent more directly towards state 15 while minimizing the risk of falling into holes would be effective. Maybe testing a policy where most states are set to move right or down, adjusted for the slippery effect.
