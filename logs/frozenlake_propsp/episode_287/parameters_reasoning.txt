You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment to maximize the reward. The goal is to reach state 15, which gives a +1 reward, while avoiding holes that end the episode with zero reward.

First, I need to understand how the slippery nature affects movement. Each action has three possible outcomes with equal probability because of the slipperiness. For example, moving right (action 1) can lead to move right, down, or left each with 1/3 chance. So, from any given state, choosing an action doesn't guarantee moving in one direction—it's more probabilistic.

The policy is a function that maps each state (0-15) to an action (0-3). The challenge is to design this mapping so that the agent has the highest probability of reaching state 15 without falling into any holes.

Looking at the provided examples, most policies have average rewards around 0.15 or lower. The top-performing one got 0.25, which is still below the target of 1.0. This suggests that there's room for improvement and perhaps a better policy exists.

Since I'm supposed to act as a stateless optimizer, I need to maximize information gain each iteration. Given that previous policies have lower rewards, I should explore more rather than exploit. So, I'll try to propose a new set of parameters that haven't been tried before or tweak the best ones slightly.

One approach is to design a policy that directs the agent towards state 15 as efficiently as possible while avoiding known holes. Let's consider each state and decide which action would best help reach the goal without risking falling into a hole.

For example, in state 0 (top-left corner), moving right or down could be beneficial since those directions lead closer to the goal. But due to slipperiness, choosing an action that has a higher chance of moving towards the goal is better.

I'll map out each state and think about the best action:

- State 0: Top-left. Moving right (action 1) might take it towards state 1 or possibly down to state 4.
- State 1: Top-middle. Moving right could lead towards state 2 or state 5, which is further down.
- ...
- Similarly, for each state, I'll decide which action would help in progressing towards the goal.

However, since movement is probabilistic, it's hard to predict exact paths. So, a better approach might be to use value iteration or Q-learning to determine optimal policies. But given the constraints of this exercise, I need to propose specific actions for each state.

Looking at previous top-performing policies, many have high values in certain states. For instance, action 2 and 3 seem popular because they allow moving up, right, down, etc., which are useful directions.

I'll try to create a policy where from each state, the agent has a higher chance of moving towards state 15. I'll also ensure that actions don't lead into known holes based on the trajectories provided.

After considering all states and possible movements, here's a proposed policy:

params[0]: 2 (action up might not help but could vary)
Wait, maybe starting with action 1 to move right from state 0 is better. So params[0] = 1.

But I need to think carefully about each state's optimal action. Perhaps using a grid-based approach where the agent moves towards the bottom-right direction as much as possible.

Alternatively, since movement is slippery, maybe choosing actions that have a higher chance of moving in the desired direction. For example, if from state 0, choosing action 1 (right) would give a 1/3 chance to move right and 1/3 each for down and left. Left might not help as it's already at the edge.

Wait, but state 0 can only go right or down because moving up isn't possible (as it's top row), so perhaps choosing action 0 which is [down, left, up], but up is impossible, so maybe action 1 is better for movement towards the goal.

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should look for patterns in previous policies and see if tweaking them can yield higher rewards.

Looking at the most recent parameters:

params[0]: 1; params[1]: 2; ... f(params): 0.05
Trajectory: (0,0) moves to (4,0), then to (8,3), etc.

Another recent one had all actions as 1 or 3, which might have led the agent in circles.

Perhaps a better approach is to set each state's action to move towards the goal as much as possible. For example:

- From states closer to the top-left, choose actions that tend to move right or down.
- From middle states, choose actions that move towards the bottom-right.
- Avoid actions that could lead into holes based on trajectories.

But without knowing where the holes are exactly, it's tricky. The trajectories show some paths leading to falls, so I need to infer possible hole locations.

For example, in one trajectory, moving from state 0 with action 1 led to state 4 (down), which then moved to state 8, and so on. So maybe state 8 is a safe spot.

Alternatively, if an action from a certain state often leads to a fall, that state's action should be adjusted.

Given the limited information, I'll propose a policy where each state directs towards the goal as much as possible with actions that have a higher chance of moving in the desired direction. Let's say:

- For states on the top row (0-3), prefer right or down.
- For states on the leftmost column (0,4,8,12), prefer right or down.
- For other states, choose actions that move towards increasing row and column indices.

This might involve setting action 1 for many states to push towards the right, but considering slipperiness, perhaps a mix of actions would be better.

Alternatively, looking at the previous best policy with f(params)=0.25:

params[0]: 2; params[1]:3; ... which had trajectory (0,1) (4,2) (8,2). That seems to move down and right.

So maybe setting action 2 for state 0 would help in moving towards the goal more effectively.

After considering all this, I think a good approach is to set each state's action to either 1 or 3, which allow movements that can help reach the goal. For example:

- Even-numbered states might take action 1 (right) or 3 (left?), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps setting all states to action 2 or 3 would give a better chance of moving towards the right and up/down as needed.

Given that in the previous best policy, state 0 was set to action 2, leading to movement down, which might be useful. So maybe continuing with similar logic.

But I need to ensure each state's action is unique and hasn't been tried before to maximize exploration.

After careful consideration, here's a proposed new parameter configuration that differs from the previous ones, focusing on moving towards the goal while considering slipperiness.
