You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best action for this frozen lake environment problem. Let me start by understanding what's given here.

First, the grid is 4x4 with states numbered from 0 to 15. Each state represents a position on the grid. The agent can move up, down, left, or right. There are some interesting rules about which actions get selected based on previous experience.

The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers, where each value corresponds to the action (0-3) for states 0-15. So params[0] is the action for state 0, and so on up to params[15].

The tricky part here is that when the agent takes an action, it doesn't get a fixed probability of choosing that action every time. Instead, the environment's "slippery" feature makes things more complicated. When an action is chosen, there's a chance (25%) that it won't take effect because the agent slips to one of three possible directions.

But wait, no—the problem actually says when taking action 0, the agent can go down, left, or up with equal probability; similarly for others. Wait, no—let me re-read: "When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability." So each of those three directions has a 1/3 chance.

But if slipping doesn't apply, then the policy should be followed as per the given rules. However, because the grid is slippery, sometimes an action taken might not actually result in movement—so the agent could end up staying in the same place, which would complicate exploration and potentially trap them in a hole.

Looking at the examples provided, one of them has params that suggest avoiding immediate dangerous moves. For instance, in some cases, if you're on (0,1), the action is 1 (right). In another example, when on (3,2) (state 8), the agent takes action 3 (down), which might be a safer option given it's towards a hole.

But wait, state 15 is the goal. So, I'm thinking that around certain states, taking specific actions could lead to immediate penalties or risks of falling into holes. The policy needs to balance exploration and exploiting these known dangerous areas.

Given that the problem mentions "holes in the map that will end the game once the agent steps onto it," perhaps certain paths are more likely to lead into holes if not explored enough. So, focusing on states with higher risk might be better.

Looking at the examples provided, the best-performing params have different patterns:

- One has action 2 (up) on state 15.
- Another has action 3 (down) when in certain positions.
- Some set actions to 0, which suggests avoiding dangerous moves.

But considering the slippery nature of the environment, each action's effect might be probabilistic. So, even if an action is selected based on policy, slipping could make it difficult to reliably move in that direction.

I think a good strategy would be to focus on states that are more likely to lead into holes or require exploration. Maybe prioritize actions that are taken less frequently but still have a higher chance of leading to bad outcomes, encouraging the agent to explore those areas more.

In the examples given, some actions are taken at state 15 (params[0]=3, params[1]=2, etc.), which might be safer since it's the goal. Others set certain parameters in different states, but I'm not sure how that ties into exploration.

Another thought: perhaps using a Q-learning-like approach where the agent learns to avoid dangerous moves by rewarding them and penalizing others. But given the deterministic nature of the policy except for the slipping probability, it might require more trial and error.

I also recall that in such environments, sometimes prioritizing certain states as safer ones can help in exploration. For example, state 15 is safe, so if the agent can safely reach there, it's better than risking to go into a hole.

Putting this together, I think the optimal policy should avoid actions that might lead to immediate penalties or high slip rates towards dangerous areas. By focusing on states that are more likely to cause issues, the agent can explore these regions more thoroughly, leading to better rewards and a higher chance of finding the goal without falling into holes.
