You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to help the user optimize their policy for the FrozenLake environment. Let me start by understanding the problem.

So, the environment is a 4x4 grid where each cell can be represented as a state from 0 to 15. The agent can move in four directions (up, down, left, right), but because of the slippery nature, taking an action leads to three possible moves with equal probability. The goal is to reach state 15, which gives a reward of +1, while other states give 0. There are holes that end the episode if stepped on.

The user's task is to find the optimal policy, represented by an array of 16 actions (params), where each index corresponds to a state and holds the action (0-3) to take when in that state. The challenge is to propose these params iteratively, aiming for a reward close to 1.0.

Looking at the user's message, they provided some top-performing params and recent attempts. The best so far have an average reward of around 0.45, which is below the target of 1.0. So, it seems we're still in the exploration phase rather than exploitation since the rewards are not close to optimal yet.

The user also mentioned that I should be a stateless optimizer, meaning each suggestion must be based solely on the current buffer without any memory of past interactions. My goal is to maximize information gain by suggesting params that can help determine which actions lead closer to the goal or avoid holes.

From the trajectories provided, I notice that many attempts end quickly either by falling into holes or taking a long time to reach the goal. For example, some trajectories immediately go down or right but then fall into holes or loop without progress.

To improve this, perhaps I should focus on states near the goal and ensure their policies guide towards it while avoiding known holes. Also, considering that actions lead to multiple possible next states due to slipperiness, the policy needs to be robust against these uncertainties.

Looking at state 15 (the goal), setting params[15] to any action might not matter since the episode ends upon reaching it, but ensuring that the surrounding states (like 14, 13) have actions that reliably lead to 15 is crucial.

Another approach is to ensure that from each state, the chosen action has a high probability of moving towards the goal without falling into holes. For example, if a certain action in state X often leads to a hole, we should avoid choosing that action.

Given the current best params have a reward around 0.45, it's clear that the policy is not optimal yet. So I need to suggest params that change enough from previous attempts to explore new trajectories but are still informed by what might work better.

Looking at recent params, many have similar structures with some variations in certain states. Maybe tweaking a few key states where decisions are critical could lead to higher rewards.

I'll consider changing the actions for states near the goal and along common paths. For instance, state 0 (top-left corner) is crucial because it's the starting point. If from state 0, choosing action 1 or 2 might lead towards the right or down, which are good directions toward the goal.

Also, ensuring that when moving towards the right or down, the policy doesn't get stuck in loops or fall into holes. For example, if a certain action in state X often leads to a hole, we should choose an alternative action that avoids that.

I'll try modifying the actions for key states like 0, 1, 4, 5, etc., which are starting points and junctions in the grid. Maybe setting more directions towards right and down from these states could help progress towards the goal.

In summary, I need to propose a new set of params that slightly varies from previous attempts, focusing on ensuring movement towards the goal while avoiding holes, especially in critical states.
