You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I need to come up with the next set of parameters for the FrozenLake environment based on the information provided. Let me try to understand the problem first.

The environment is a 4x4 grid where the agent moves around, but it's slippery, so each action can lead the agent in one of three directions randomly. The goal is state 15 (bottom-right corner), which gives +1 reward, and all other states give 0 except if the agent falls into a hole.

The policy is an array of 16 values, each indicating the action to take for that state. The challenge is to find the optimal policy that maximizes the reward, ideally around 1.0.

Looking at the history provided:

- The top 7 best-performing policies all have average rewards around 0.35 to 0.45. That's significantly below the target of 1.0, so we're not close yet.
- The most recent 5 policies have even lower rewards (mostly 0.0), which suggests that some recent attempts might have been taking more risks or hitting holes.

The user mentioned that I should act as a stateless optimizer. Since the rewards are far below 1.0, I should focus on exploring new configurations rather than exploiting known good ones. Also, each suggested parameter set must be unique and not repeat any previously seen ones.

From the trajectories provided:

- Some policies get stuck in loops or end up in holes quickly.
- The best-performing policies have certain action patterns that might avoid immediate holes but aren't reaching the goal efficiently.

I should consider what changes can lead the agent closer to the goal while avoiding holes. Let's think about key states and their optimal actions:

1. State 0 (start) is top-left. Possible actions from previous good policies are 1 or 2. Maybe trying different actions here could help.
2. States around the edges might need specific actions to avoid falling into holes.
3. The goal is state 15, so we want the agent to move right and down as much as possible but considering the slippery nature.

I'll try to modify some of the parameters in a way that encourages movement towards the goal without getting stuck or hitting holes. Let's think about changing specific states' actions:

- For state 0 (top-left), if it was previously set to action 1, maybe changing it to action 3 could help move right with higher probability.
- Similarly, for other edge states, ensuring that their actions don't lead them into the water.

I should generate a new parameter array that's distinct from all previous ones. Let me try to adjust some key states:

params[0] = 3 (action right)
params[1] = 2 (action up or right or down? Wait, no—wait, action definitions: each action has three possible directions.

Wait, the slippery effect for each action is fixed. For example, action 0 leads to [down, left, up]. So I need to choose actions that have a higher chance of moving towards the goal considering the possible slips.

Alternatively, maybe choosing actions that increase the likelihood of moving right and down over time.

But since it's slippery, perhaps setting actions that when chosen, their three options are more likely to lead toward the goal.

For example, for state 0 (top-left), action 1 leads to [right, down, left]. So if we choose action 1, there's a chance to move right or down. Maybe this is better than other actions.

Wait, but in previous policies, some had params[0] as 1 and others as 2. Let me see:

Looking back at the top 7, many have params[0] set to 1 or 2. So perhaps trying a different action here could help.

Alternatively, for state 14 (third row last column), we want it to go right to reach 15. But since it's slippery, choosing an action that can move right with some probability.

But without knowing the exact hole positions, I need to rely on general movement towards the goal while avoiding edges where holes might be.

Let me try creating a new parameter set:

params[0]: 3 (action 3: [left, up, right] — maybe this gives more varied directions but could help in some way)
But wait, state 0 is top-left. Moving left would stay in the same column? Or perhaps it's better to move down or right.

Wait, in the grid:

- State 0 is (0,0), so moving right would go to state 1, moving down would go to state 4.
- So for state 0, choosing action 2 (which has [up, right, down]) might be better because up isn't possible (already at top), but right and down are towards the goal.

Alternatively, action 1 for state 0 gives [right, down, left], which includes right and down, which are good directions.

But in previous policies, some have params[0] as 1 or 2. Let me pick an action that's different from what's been tried before, maybe 3.

Wait, but the exact hole positions aren't given, so it's tricky to decide without knowing where they are. So perhaps the best approach is to try a new configuration that's different from previous ones and see if it leads to better rewards.

I'll go through each state and assign an action that seems logical:

- State 0: Let's try action 3 (right, up, left). But since it's at top-left, up isn't possible, so effectively, right or left. Maybe not the best. Alternatively, action 1 which allows right and down.

But to explore new territory, let me set params[0] as 3.

Similarly, for state 1 (top-middle), previous policies have mostly used action 3. Let's try a different action here, like action 2.

Wait, but I need to ensure that each parameter is unique from all previous ones. Looking at the recent parameters:

In the most recent 5, params[0] varies between 1, 2, 3. So setting params[0] as 1 again might not be new enough.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to try a completely different set of actions for several states.

But considering time constraints and the need to propose something now, I'll create a new parameter array with some changes from previous ones:

- Change state 0 to action 2.
- State 1 to action 0 or 3.
- Adjust other key states like 4,5,6, etc., to encourage movement towards the goal.

Wait, perhaps another approach is needed. Since I can't remember previous attempts except what's in the buffer, and I have to maximize information gain, maybe I should choose a parameter that hasn't been tried before or varies significantly from existing ones.

Looking at the recent parameters, many have params[0] as 1 or 2. Let me set it to 3 for state 0.

For state 7 (top-right), previous policies might have action 2 or 3. Let's try action 0 which would move down, left, up. But in state 7, moving down is towards the goal.

Wait, but I'm not sure about hole positions, so it's hard to decide. Maybe better to proceed with setting some key states to actions that push toward the goal more.

I think I'll proceed by creating a parameter array where most states are set to action 2 or 3, encouraging right and down movements, while avoiding repetition from previous policies.

After considering all this, here's my proposed parameters:
</think>

params[0]: 2, params[1]: 3, params[2]: 0, params[3]: 1, params[4]: 1, params[5]: 2, params[6]: 3, params[7]: 0, params[8]: 2, params[9]: 3, params[10]: 1, params[11]: 0, params[12]: 3, params[13]: 2, params[14]: 3, params[15]: 2
