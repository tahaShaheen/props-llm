You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy parameters for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to maximize the reward by reaching state 15, which gives a +1 reward. All other states give 0 except if you fall into a hole, which ends the episode with no reward.

First, I need to understand how the slippery environment works. Each action (left, down, right, up) has three possible outcomes each with equal probability. So, for example, choosing action 0 could lead to moving down, left, or up randomly. This makes the environment stochastic and a bit tricky because actions don't always result in the intended movement.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 numbers (params[0] to params[15]), each representing the action taken from that state. The challenge is to find the optimal set of these parameters to maximize the expected reward, which should ideally be around 1.0 if we can reach the goal consistently.

Looking at the provided data, the top-performing policies have rewards around 0.30, which is not very high. This suggests that there's room for improvement. The recent policies all have rewards of 0.00, which indicates they might be stuck or not making progress towards the goal.

I need to decide whether to explore new policies (as an Explorer) since the current rewards are far below 1.0, or tweak existing ones slightly as an Optimizer. Since the best reward is 0.30, which is significantly below 1.0, I should focus on exploration to gather more information about which states and actions lead towards the goal.

One approach could be to ensure that from each state, the policy chooses actions that have a high probability of eventually reaching state 15 without falling into holes. Since the environment is slippery, the policy needs to account for multiple possible paths.

I should consider setting up policies where from each state, the action selected has the highest chance of moving towards the goal direction. For example, from the top-left corner (state 0), choosing an action that tends to move right or down could be beneficial since those directions lead closer to state 15.

Looking at the current top policies, they have various actions, but their reward is still low. Maybe I need to adjust certain states' actions to better navigate towards the goal while avoiding holes. For instance, ensuring that from state 8 (top-left of the third row), the action leads towards state 9 or 12.

I also notice that some recent policies have trajectories that loop endlessly without reaching the goal. This might be due to cyclic movements or not having a clear path towards the goal. To break this cycle, I should choose actions that push the agent more directly towards the right or down directions.

Another consideration is that since each action has three possible outcomes, we need policies that statistically increase the chance of moving towards the goal despite the randomness. For example, from state 3 (top row, third column), choosing an action that can lead either to state 4 (down) or state 7 (right) might be better.

I should also ensure that from states near the bottom-right corner, like state 12 and 13, the actions chosen have a high chance of moving towards state 15 without falling into any holes. So, for state 12, choosing an action that can move up or right would be beneficial, while for state 14, moving right should lead to state 15.

Finally, I'll need to propose a new set of params that are different from previous ones, focusing on actions that guide the agent towards the goal. This might involve setting certain states to specific actions that have higher probabilities of success based on their position and possible transitions.
