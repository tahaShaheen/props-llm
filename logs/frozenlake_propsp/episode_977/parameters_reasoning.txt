You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me try to understand the problem first.

The environment is a 4x4 grid with states numbered from 0 to 15. The agent can move in four directions—left, down, right, up—but because it's slippery, each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability. So, for example, taking action 0 (which corresponds to moving left, down, or up) will send the agent randomly to one of those three directions.

The goal is state 15 (the bottom-right corner), which gives a reward of +1, while all other states give 0. There are holes in the grid that end the episode if stepped on.

Given that the policy is represented by an array of 16 actions (each action being 0-3), my task is to suggest these parameters step by step, with the aim of maximizing the episodic reward.

From the problem description, I can see that the current best policies are averaging around 0.45, which is below the target of 1.0. This suggests that we're not yet reaching the goal reliably.

Looking at the recent attempts and their trajectories, many seem to be getting stuck or falling into holes. For example, one trajectory went (0,3) several times and then fell into a hole, resulting in no reward. Another had the agent oscillating between states without progress.

I think the key is to design a policy that avoids these holes while guiding the agent towards state 15 as efficiently as possible. Since each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability, the policy needs to choose actions that have the highest chance of moving towards the goal without risking falling into a hole.

Let me consider how each state should behave:

- State 0 (top-left corner): The agent can move down, right, or up. But since it's the top row, moving up isn't possible, so perhaps action 1 is best, which includes moving right as an option.
- State 15 is the goal; we don't need to define its policy.

Looking at the recent policies suggested, they've tried various combinations but haven't achieved high rewards. To improve, maybe focusing on states near the goal and ensuring safe paths.

I should also consider that slipping can cause unexpected moves, so the policy must be robust against these uncertainties. Perhaps using a mix of actions that have a higher chance of moving towards the goal while avoiding risky holes.

Given that we're in the "Explorer" phase (since rewards are below 1.0), I need to suggest a new set of parameters that's distinct from previous ones but has a good chance of improving performance.

Let me draft a possible policy:

- For states near the edges, choose actions that move towards the center or towards the goal.
- Avoid actions that have high risk of falling into known holes.

For example:
- State 0: Action 1 (right, down, left) - allows moving right towards state 3.
- State 1: Maybe action 3 (left, up, right), but since it's on the top row, up isn't possible; so perhaps action 3 could help avoid falling into a hole below?
- States in the bottom row should aim to move right or stay if they're already in state 15.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe it's better to look for a policy that prioritizes moving towards the goal while minimizing risks of falling into holes.

I think I'll propose a new set of parameters where each state chooses an action that has at least one move towards the goal and avoids known dangerous moves.
