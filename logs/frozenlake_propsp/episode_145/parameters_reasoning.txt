You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. So, first, let me understand the problem.

The grid is 4x4 with states numbered from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). The goal is state 15, which gives a reward of +1. All other states give 0. There are holes that end the episode if stepped on. The agent can move in four directions, but because it's slippery, each action leads to three possible next states with equal probability.

The policy is an array of 16 values, where each value is 0-3 representing the action taken from that state. My goal is to find the optimal params that maximize the average reward over 20 episodes.

Looking at the provided information:

- The best performing policies so far have an average reward around 0.15.
- Trajectories show agents getting stuck or falling into holes, indicating that current policies aren't great at avoiding them or reaching the goal efficiently.

Since I need to maximize information gain and remember nothing from previous attempts, I should choose a policy that's different from what's been tried before but also has potential to improve performance. 

In the top 8 best params, many have actions that cycle between certain directions, maybe leading the agent in circles or not effectively towards the goal. For example, several of them alternate between action 1 and 3, which might cause the agent to move sideways a lot.

I should consider policies where from each state, the action taken increases the chance of moving closer to the goal while avoiding holes. Since the environment is slippery, the policy needs to account for possible movements in three directions.

Maybe I can set up a deterministic policy that tries to navigate directly towards the right and down as much as possible since the goal is at (3,3). But because of the slipperiness, it's more about increasing the probability of moving in the correct general direction.

Looking at some previous policies:

- params[0]: 1; when in state 0, action 1 (right, down, left) might not be the best. Perhaps action 2 (up, right, down) would have a higher chance to move towards the right or down.
- For states closer to the goal, like 14 and 15, I need to make sure they take actions that don't lead them into holes.

Wait, but without knowing which states are holes, it's tricky. The problem says the agent should locate the wholes via previous trajectories. So from the given trajectories, I can infer where holes might be.

Looking at the trajectories:

- One trajectory ends in (0,3) after multiple steps and then falls into a hole.
- Another goes through (8,3), which might be a hole if it ended the episode there.

I need to adjust the policy so that from states adjacent to these holes, the agent doesn't choose actions that would lead it into them. For example, if state 14 is next to a hole, then params[14] should avoid actions that could lead to that hole.

But without explicit knowledge of where the holes are, I have to infer based on trajectories. If an episode ends quickly at a certain state, it's likely a hole.

In the given examples:

- A trajectory ending in (0,3) suggests that state 3 is a hole.
- Another ends in (4,2), which might not be a hole, but maybe state 8 is a hole if the next steps led to termination.

Wait, actually, each time an episode stops because of stepping on a hole, so any state after the last step must be a hole. For example:

In one trajectory: (0,1) (4,2) (8,2). So, perhaps state 8 is a hole? Because the next action would have been from 8, but the episode ended there.

Similarly, another trajectory ends at (0,3), so state 3 is a hole. Another ends at (4,0), so maybe state 4 is a hole?

Wait no, in the third most recent params, the trajectory was (0,0) -> (4,3). If that ended there, then state 4 might be a hole.

Alternatively, perhaps states 14 and 8 are holes because their next steps led to termination.

I need to adjust the policy to avoid actions leading into these inferred holes.

So, for each state, choose an action that maximizes moving towards the goal (right or down) while avoiding transitions into holes.

For example:

- From state 0 (top-left), taking action 1 (right, down, left). Right would lead to state 1, which is better than others. But since it's slippery, action 2 might be better as it includes right and down.
Wait, action 0: move down, left, up; action 1: move right, down, left; action 2: up, right, down; action 3: left, up, right.

So, from state 0, if I take action 2 (up, right, down), but since you can't go up from row 0, it would only move right or down. Wait no, in the grid, moving up from state 0 isn't possible because it's at the top row. So when you're on state 0 and take an action that includes up (like action 2), the actual movement might be adjusted.

Wait, actually, I think each action choice leads to three possible directions with equal probability, but if moving in a direction is impossible (e.g., up from state 0), then it just doesn't move or maybe stays in place. Or perhaps it cycles through valid moves only? The problem description isn't entirely clear on that.

Assuming that when an action would take the agent out of bounds, it's treated as not moving or another possible direction is considered.

But to be safe, I'll assume that actions are chosen such that from each state, all three directions in the action's set are valid. So for state 0 (top-left), the action 2 includes up, which isn't possible, so maybe it just doesn't contribute, or perhaps the agent can only move right or down.

But I'm not entirely sure. Given this uncertainty, I'll proceed by trying to choose actions that generally push the agent towards the goal and avoid inferred holes.

Given that in previous policies, many had params[15] set to 2 or 3, but if state 14 is a hole, then from state 14, action 2 might lead to state 15, which is good. Alternatively, action 3 could also lead there.

But without knowing the exact holes, it's challenging, so I'll proceed by making educated guesses based on trajectories.

Looking at the most recent policies:

- The last few had params[0]: 1; which leads to some issues.
- Perhaps setting more states towards right and down actions would help.

Let me try creating a policy where from each state, the action chosen is the one that maximizes moving right or down. For example:

From even rows (0,2), prefer right actions. From odd rows (1,3), prefer down actions.

Alternatively, think of it as trying to move towards the bottom-right corner.

But I need to set each params[i] to 0-3, ensuring that from each state, the action chosen has a higher probability of moving towards the goal and avoiding holes.

Given that in the provided data, many policies have low rewards (around 0.1), it's clear that agents aren't reaching the goal often, suggesting they're getting stuck or falling into holes frequently.

So, perhaps I should design a policy where from each state, the agent has a higher chance of moving towards the right or down while avoiding known problematic states.

Looking at the trajectories:

- A trajectory ends in (0,3), which suggests that state 3 is a hole. So params[3] should avoid actions that could lead to this hole.
- Another ends in (4,2) but continues; perhaps state 8 is a hole as it's after moving from 4.

Wait, no, the trajectory was (0,1) → (4,2) → (8,2), then I assume the next step led to a hole, so state 8 might be a hole. Therefore, from state 8, the agent should avoid actions that would lead it into another hole.

But without knowing all holes, this is difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to create a deterministic policy where each state has a single action that directly leads towards the goal, considering possible slipperiness.

Wait, but since the environment is stochastic, choosing an action that increases the probability of moving towards the goal is better.

For example:

- From state 0 (top-left), choose action 1 (right, down, left). Right would take to state 1; down to state 4. Both are steps towards the goal.
- From state 1, action 3 (left, up, right) might not be ideal as it could move back.

Alternatively, perhaps using a greedy approach where from each state, the agent tries to move right or down based on which direction is closer to the goal.

Another idea: use value iteration or Q-learning principles to determine optimal actions. But since I can't remember previous attempts, I need to choose a policy that explores new areas.

Given all this, perhaps setting a consistent action across states could help. For example:

- Even-numbered states (0,2,4,...) take action 1.
- Odd-numbered states take action 3.

Wait, but looking at previous top params, many had alternating actions between 1 and 3, which might not be effective.

Alternatively, set all states to action 2 or 3 to encourage moving right or down.

But without knowing the exact holes, it's hard. Maybe try a policy where from each state, the agent has a higher chance of moving towards the goal by selecting actions that lead right or down.

After considering all this, I think setting a policy where most states choose action 2 (up, right, down) might help because it includes moving right and down, which are good directions. Alternatively, action 1 could be better for some states.

I'll try creating a policy where:

- From states that are on the top row (0-3), prefer action 1 (right, down, left). This would encourage moving right or down.
- From other rows, choose actions that move down or right as much as possible.

But I'm not sure. Maybe another approach is to set all states to action 2 except for those near the goal.

Alternatively, perhaps setting a policy where from each state, the agent chooses an action that can lead it towards the goal without getting stuck in loops.

Wait, considering that previous policies had low rewards, maybe the optimal policy needs to be more cautious. Maybe set some states to stay still or move in directions that avoid holes entirely.

But since I don't know where all the holes are, this is tricky.

Given the time constraints and need to output a valid params array, I'll proceed by creating a policy where each state chooses an action that has the highest probability of moving towards the goal while avoiding known problematic states based on trajectories.

For example:

- From state 0: action 1 (right, down, left). This allows movement right or down.
- From state 1: action 3 (left, up, right). Could lead back or forward.
But perhaps better to choose action 2 (up, right, down), but from state 1, moving up is not possible.

Wait, no, for state 1, which is (0,1), moving up would stay in the same row, so it's possible. So, action 2 could be good as it includes right and down.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Given that, perhaps I'll randomly choose a different policy from previous ones but with some changes to see if it can get better rewards.

Looking at the most recent params:

params[0]:1; ...; params[15]:2; which gave 0.15.

I could change some states' actions to see if that improves things. For example, set state 7 to action 3 instead of 3 (no change). Or perhaps vary more states.

But without knowing what's effective, it's hard. Maybe I'll propose a policy where most states take action 2 or 3 to encourage right and down movements.
