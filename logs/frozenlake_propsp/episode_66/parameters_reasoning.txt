You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to find the best policy for this FrozenLake environment using the given parameters and reward function. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward by choosing action values from 0 to 3 for each of the four states (0-3x4 grid). 

First, I need to understand how the policy works. Each state corresponds to an element in the params array. For example, params[0] is the action when on state 0, and so on up to params[15]. The actions are defined as left (0), right (1), down (2), or up (3). 

The policy here is represented by these parameters which should guide the agent's behavior. Since each parameter can only be 0, 1, 2, or 3, I need to find a combination of these that optimizes the reward.

Looking at the top-performing examples provided, one has all actions set to 2 except for state 5 (params[5]=0). This policy seems to avoid stepping on some holes in the map. Another example sets params[1] to 3 when in state 6, which might encourage moving right more there.

I remember that the reward is zero everywhere except for state 15, where it's +1. So avoiding entering hole states gives me a chance to collect this reward. I also need to avoid falling into these holes because stepping on them ends the game, which I want to prevent.

I think setting params[3] (up) as 2 in some states might help move back up when needed without falling down into the holes. But I have to be careful not to take that action too often if it leads to high negative rewards elsewhere.

Let me consider each state:

- State 0: The top-left corner. Maybe avoid moving left (since from there, you can go down or right). So params[0] could be 3 (up) or 1 (right).
- State 2: Middle-right of the top row. Moving up might take it back to state 0.
- State 4: Middle-right column's bottom row. Need to avoid falling into the hole, so maybe moving up is better than down.

I should aim for a policy that explores all directions when possible except where it would lead to penalties or holes. Maybe set params[3] (up) to 2 in most states except where necessary.

Looking at the top-performing example, params[5]=0 might indicate avoiding some holes. Also, other parameters like 1 and 3 being higher can encourage certain movements.

I think a strategy would be to have high values for actions that allow exploration without immediate penalties, especially around the hole in state 5 (params[5]=0). Maybe set params[1] to 3 when on states that require right moves, but avoid it if the reward is low.

Putting this all together, I'll suggest parameters where the middle row and certain columns are explored more. Let me try setting:

params = [2, 1, 2, 3]

This way, in state 0 (top-left), moving down or left are options, but maybe prefer moving right if possible. In state 4, up is better to avoid the hole.

But I might need to adjust some parameters based on specific test runs. Alternatively, setting params[1] and params[3] higher for middle row states could help.

I think the optimal value should have a balance between exploring necessary directions and avoiding holes. Maybe set certain keys (like state 5) to avoid penalties and others to encourage right moves when needed.
