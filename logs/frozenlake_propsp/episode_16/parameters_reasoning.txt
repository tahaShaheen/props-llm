You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15, which is the bottom right corner, but that takes a reward of +1. All other states give 0 rewards. However, there are some holes in the map—wholes that would end the game if stepped onto. I need to find the best action policy using a parameter array where each element represents an action from state 0 to 15.

First, I recall that the policy is represented as an array of size 16, where each index corresponds to a state and the value at each index is the action taken when in that state. The actions are numbered 0 to 3, corresponding to directions left, down, right, or up.

The tricky part here is understanding how the parameters work. Each parameter can be either 0, 1, 2, or 3. For each state (i), we pick an action from a set of possible actions based on that index in the params array. The sets are:

- Action 0: move down, left, up
- Action 1: move right, down, left
- Action 2: move up, right, down
- Action 3: move left, up, right

So for each state i, the possible actions are determined by which parameters allow that action to be selected. For example, if params[i] is 0 or 1, then in state i, the agent can choose action 0 (down, left, up). If params[i] is 2 or 3, action 1 (right, down, up) is possible.

The global optimal reward should be around None, meaning we're looking for a policy that consistently reaches the goal without getting stuck in holes. The agent needs to explore through previously seen trajectories and pick actions that avoid falling into holes.

Looking at the provided parameters, it seems like some states are being recommended to take action 2 (up, right, down), which is one of the most likely candidates for avoiding local minima or staying away from holes. However, sometimes action 0 is suggested when certain other actions aren't available due to state constraints.

I should consider that each parameter choice affects multiple states because each action set includes different directions. For example, if params[2] (up) is selected in a state, the agent can move up, which might be useful for avoiding going back into a hole if it leads there from other areas.

Also, since the policy needs to avoid holes and efficiently reach the goal, I should prioritize actions that lead towards state 15. For instance, taking action 3 (left) or action 2 (up/down) might help in moving closer to the exit.

I think the optimal strategy would involve a balance between exploring near-holes and exploiting known best paths. But given that parameters are limited, I need to find a set of actions that maximizes the chances of reaching state 15 without getting stuck.

After considering all possible combinations, it seems like choosing action 2 (up, right, down) is crucial because it provides multiple avenues for movement, reducing the risk of falling into holes. Therefore, the parameters should likely be set to encourage taking actions that don't restrict immediate access to state 15.
