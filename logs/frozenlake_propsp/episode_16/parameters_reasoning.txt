You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to set the policy parameters for this FrozenLake environment to get the optimal reward. The goal is to reach state 15, which gives a +1 reward, and avoid the holes. 

First, I need to understand the setup. It's a 4x4 grid with states numbered from 0 to 15. Each state corresponds to a position on the grid. Actions are directions (left, down, right, up), but because the environment is slippery, each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability.

The policy is an array of 16 numbers, each indicating which action to take from that state. My task is to propose these parameters in a way that maximizes the reward.

Looking at the information provided, I see some top performing params but their rewards are low (0.05). The global optimal should be around 1.0, so clearly we're not there yet. Since the rewards are far below 1.0, I should act as an "Explorer" and choose a new configuration distinct from previous ones to gather more information.

I need to make sure that each state's action doesn't lead into a hole. From the trajectories provided, it seems like certain actions might be leading agents into holes or getting stuck in loops. For example, if the agent is on state 0 (top-left corner), taking an up action would go out of bounds, but since the environment wraps around, maybe that's handled differently. Alternatively, some states might have only certain safe actions.

I should consider which states are near the goal and how to navigate towards them without falling into holes. For instance, state 15 is the goal, so any path leading there is good. States adjacent to it (like 14, 10, 11) should take right or down actions if possible.

Looking at some of the trajectories, when params[0] is set to 3, the agent goes to state 1 and then tries to move up, which might not be safe. Alternatively, setting params[0] to 1 would try to move right, but that could also lead into a hole if not careful.

I think I should start by ensuring that each state's action leads towards the goal or away from holes. Maybe set actions for states closer to the goal to directly move towards it. For example, state 14 (second last in the bottom row) should take the right action to reach 15.

But since the environment is slippery, the agent can't control exactly where it goes. So setting a policy that maximizes the chance of eventually reaching the goal while minimizing the risk of hitting a hole.

I might need to set actions for each state that have the highest probability of moving towards the goal and away from holes. For instance, in state 12 (bottom-left), taking a right action would move it to state 13 or 14, which are safe or closer to the goal.

Wait, looking at the recent params provided: 
params[0]: 3; params[1]: 2; ... etc., but the reward was 0.00. Maybe that configuration leads into a hole early on.

I should try different actions for each state, perhaps focusing on moving right or down more often to navigate towards the goal while avoiding left and up which might lead to holes or out of bounds.

Maybe I can set some states to always move right if possible, and others to move down. For example:

- State 0: Move right (action 1)
- State 1: Move right (action 1)
- State 2: Move right (action 1)
- State 3: Maybe move down or right
And so on for other states.

But I'm not sure if this is the best approach. Alternatively, perhaps a more cautious strategy where each state's action leads to a safe next step.

Wait, since all previous attempts are giving low rewards, maybe I need to try a completely different set of actions. For example, setting most states to move right or down, but making sure that near the holes, the actions avoid those directions.

Alternatively, perhaps using a greedy approach where each state's action is chosen to maximize the chance of reaching the goal without stepping on holes.

But since I can't remember previous attempts (stateless), I need to choose this new set based solely on the information provided so far.

I think I'll try setting as many states as possible towards moving right or down, avoiding actions that might lead into known hole positions. For example:

- States in the top row: move down
- Middle rows: move right or down
- Bottom rows: move right towards state 15

But without knowing exactly where the holes are, it's tricky. However, from the trajectories, I can infer that certain actions lead to failure.

For instance, if an agent takes action 0 (which leads to down, left, up), and ends up in a hole, maybe those states should avoid action 0.

Alternatively, perhaps setting all states to move right when possible, as moving right tends to navigate towards the goal on the far right.

So I'll try setting most params to 1 or 2 (actions that have a chance to move right), but ensuring that near the edges, they don't go out of bounds.

Wait, in state 3, which is top-right corner, taking action 0 would lead to down, left, up. Left would take it back to state 2, so maybe that's safer than going up (which might be a hole).

Alternatively, setting state 3 to move down or right.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe the best approach is to set all states except those near the goal to move towards the right or down, and the ones close to the goal to take direct actions to reach it.

But without knowing the exact positions of the holes, this is challenging. However, since previous policies are not working, I'll try a different configuration where each state has a balanced chance to move towards the goal while avoiding obvious risky moves.
