You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The grid is 4x4, with states numbered from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). The goal is state 15, which gives a reward of +1. Other states give 0, but some are holes that end the episode if stepped on. The agent's actions have slippery effects—each action makes it move in one of three directions with equal probability.

The policy is an array of 16 numbers, each from 0-3 indicating the action for each state. I need to propose a new set of params based on the information given, focusing on exploring since the rewards are still below 1.0.

Looking at the top-performing params, they have f(params) around 0.45, which is not great. So, we're likely in exploration mode. The recent params didn't perform well either, with some even giving negative rewards or getting stuck.

I need to think about how the agent can navigate towards state 15 without falling into holes. Since each action has a 3-way split, planning deterministic paths might not work because of the slipperiness. Instead, the policy should guide the agent in directions that maximize the chance of reaching the goal while avoiding holes.

From the trajectories provided, some attempts are getting stuck in loops or falling into traps. For example, starting at state 0 (top-left), taking action 3 (left) would keep it in place if there's a hole nearby. Maybe I should adjust the actions for states that are near the edges or holes to avoid such issues.

I should consider changing some of the actions for states that lead into holes. For example, maybe state 0 shouldn't take action 3 because moving left from (0,0) would stay there, which might be a hole? Wait, in the initial setup, the holes aren't explicitly listed, but I can infer based on trajectories.

Looking at the recent attempts, some went to states like 6 or 10 and got stuck. So perhaps adjusting the actions for these states could help. Maybe setting state 6 (top-middle) to move right instead of up? Or ensuring that from state 4, moving down is avoided if it's a hole.

Wait, I'm not sure which states are holes. The problem says they need to be inferred via exploration. So, maybe the best approach is to set policies that encourage movement towards the goal (state 15) while avoiding areas where previous attempts have failed.

In state 0, taking action 2 (right) could move it towards the right, which might help in reaching the goal. Similarly, for other states near the edges or potential holes, choosing actions that lead towards safer paths.

I should also think about symmetry and try different combinations to break out of loops. For example, varying the actions for adjacent states so that the agent doesn't get stuck moving in circles.

Given all this, I'll propose a new set of params where each state's action is chosen to move towards the goal when possible, avoiding actions that could lead into known problematic areas based on previous trajectories.
