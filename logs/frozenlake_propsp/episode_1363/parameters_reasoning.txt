You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. So, the task is to find the optimal policy for a FrozenLake environment using a specific setup where each state's action is determined by an array called params. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) with maximum reward, avoiding holes.

First, I need to understand the environment details. It's a 4x4 grid, so there are 16 states numbered from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). Each state has an action that the agent takes when it's in that state. The actions are probabilistic because of the slippery nature: each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability.

The rewards are +1 for reaching state 15 and 0 elsewhere, but some states are holes which end the episode immediately if stepped on. The policy is defined by params, where each entry is an action (0-3), and we need to find the optimal set of actions that maximizes the average reward over episodes.

Looking at the interaction steps provided, it seems like I'm supposed to propose a new params configuration each time based on previous data. However, in this specific case, since it's iteration 1363 out of 5000, and considering the buffer provided, which includes top-performing params and recent ones, along with their rewards.

The key here is that I'm supposed to act as a stateless optimizer. That means each proposal shouldn't depend on previous attempts beyond what's in the buffer. Also, if the rewards are far below 1.0, I should explore new configurations; if they're close, I should optimize around the best ones.

Looking at the top-performing params, the highest reward is 0.45, which is still significantly below the target of 1.0. This suggests that exploration is still necessary. The recent params have even lower rewards, like 0.3 and 0.0, indicating that some configurations might be leading into holes or not reaching the goal efficiently.

Given this, I should focus on proposing a new set of params that explores different paths towards state 15 while avoiding known holes. Perhaps changing the actions in certain states to encourage movement towards the right or down more often could help, but since each action is probabilistic, it's tricky.

I need to make sure that the proposed params are unique and haven't been tried before. From the buffer provided, I can see that many of the top params have a lot of 1s and 3s, which correspond to specific movements. Maybe introducing more diversity in these choices could help find better paths.

One idea is to set actions in states closer to the goal (like state 12, 13, 14) to encourage right or down moves, increasing the chance of reaching 15. Additionally, for states near potential holes, selecting actions that avoid those directions might prevent falls.

But since I can't remember previous attempts beyond what's in the buffer, I have to base my decision solely on that information. So, looking at the recent params with low rewards, perhaps their policies are leading into loops or holes. Maybe adjusting a few key states' actions could break these patterns and find a more efficient path.

I also need to make sure that each proposed params array is unique and hasn't been suggested before. From the top 7, certain configurations repeat, so varying some of those might yield better results.

After considering all this, I think the best approach is to propose a new set of params where key states near the goal have actions that increase the probability of moving towards the target, while avoiding directions leading into holes. Since each action leads to three possible moves, choosing actions that maximize the chance of heading right or down from certain states could improve the reward.

So, for example, in state 14 (third row, third column), setting action 2 might push the agent more towards moving up, which isn't helpful, so perhaps changing it to an action that has a higher probability of moving right or down would be better. Similarly, adjusting states near the top and left edges to encourage movement towards the goal.

In summary, I'll propose a new params configuration where key states have actions that promote movement towards state 15 while avoiding paths leading into holes. This should help increase the reward by either reaching the goal more frequently or avoiding dangerous states.
