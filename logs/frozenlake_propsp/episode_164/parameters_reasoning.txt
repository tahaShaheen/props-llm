You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment with slippery moves. The environment is a 4x4 grid where each cell represents a state. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right corner) and get as much reward as possible.

The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers, each corresponding to a state from 0 to 15. Each number indicates the action to take in that state: 0 for down, 1 for right, 2 for up, and 3 for left. The values given in the recent examples show varying actions at different states.

The policy is initialized with all parameters set to 2, but we need to find a better one. The key here is understanding how each action leads to a reward and whether it's worth getting stuck somewhere because of the slippery environment that can lead into holes.

First, I realize that in the original examples provided, some policies give a reward of 1.0, while others give 0.20 or even lower. The fact that they're all around 0.15 suggests that many paths might not be worth the risk of stepping into a hole or getting stuck.

Since all actions are slippery and lead to equal probabilities (each action has 0.3 chance), it's unlikely that any policy will gain significant rewards unless there's a clear path towards the goal without risking holes.

Looking at the recent examples, several policies end up with only 0.10 reward or even lower, which indicates they're either not exploring effectively or getting stuck too much. The highest reward in the recent examples is around 0.25, but that might have been due to some bad paths that eventually lead back into a hole.

I think the best approach is to try policies that take all possible actions equally without any specific bias. This way, we can explore more thoroughly and avoid getting stuck on holes. However, since each action has an equal chance, maybe using all 0s (down) or some other combination could be better than randomizing.

Wait, but if we just randomly choose actions every time, that might not be the best strategy because it's too risky. The slippery nature of the environment makes us take more risks to explore new areas without getting into holes.

I remember reading somewhere that in such environments, using a policy that sometimes explores and other times is deterministic can help. For example, trying all possible actions equally or at least not favoring any single action based on previous experiences might be better than sticking with one approach.

Given the options, I think choosing 2 for each parameter (0,1,2,3) would mean taking all possible actions equally every time. This should allow the agent to explore more thoroughly without any deterministic bias, which is crucial since there are holes and it's slippery.
