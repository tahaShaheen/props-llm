You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I need to figure out the best possible policy for the FrozenLake environment based on the given information. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward, which should ideally be around 1.0 if we've found the optimal policy.

First, let's understand the environment. It's a 4x4 grid where each state has specific actions that lead to other states with equal probability due to being slippery. The agent can move in four directions, but each action results in three possible moves. The holes are present, and stepping on them ends the episode immediately.

From the problem statement, I know that the optimal reward should be around 1.0. So far, the best policies provided have rewards between 0.20 to 0.30, which is quite low. This suggests that we're not yet close to the optimal solution, so I'm in the exploration phase.

Looking at the recent trajectories and policies, many of them end quickly due to falling into holes or not reaching the goal efficiently. For example, some trajectories get stuck moving between states without making progress towards the goal.

To improve, I need to design a policy that avoids holes while guiding the agent towards state 15. One approach is to ensure that from each state, the chosen action leads the agent closer to the goal as much as possible, considering the slippery nature of movement.

I should analyze each state and determine which actions are most likely to avoid holes and progress towards the goal. For instance, starting from state 0 (top-left), moving right or down could be better. However, due to slipperiness, each action might take the agent in one of three directions. I need to choose actions that maximize the chance of eventually reaching state 15 without hitting a hole.

Given the recent attempts, it seems that some policies are getting stuck in loops or moving away from the goal. Therefore, adjusting the policy to encourage more direct paths and reduce the risk of falling into holes is crucial.

I'll propose a new set of parameters where each state's action is chosen based on maximizing the chance of reaching the goal while minimizing the risk of hitting a hole. This might involve setting certain states to move towards the right or down, as those directions generally lead closer to the goal.

After considering all this, I'll construct a new params array that selects actions for each state in a way that avoids holes and steers the agent towards the goal efficiently.
