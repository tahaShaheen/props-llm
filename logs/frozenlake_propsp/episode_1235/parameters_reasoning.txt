You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help optimize a policy for the FrozenLake environment using reinforcement learning. The goal is to find the global optimal policy that maximizes the episodic reward. Let me break down what I know and think through how to approach this.

First, the environment is a 4x4 grid with states numbered from 0 to 15. Each state corresponds to a specific position on the grid. The slippery nature of the environment means that when an agent takes an action, it has a 33% chance to go in one of three possible directions. For example, taking action 0 (left) might result in moving down, left, or up with equal probability.

The reward is +1 if the agent reaches state 15 (the bottom-right corner), and 0 otherwise. However, there are holes in the grid that end the episode if stepped on. The challenge is to design a policy that avoids these holes while navigating towards the goal.

The policy is represented by an array of 16 parameters, each corresponding to a state (from 0 to 15). Each parameter can take a value from 0 to 3, indicating the action to take in that state. The task is to find the optimal set of these parameters.

Looking at the provided data, the best-performing policies have average rewards around 0.45, which is below the target of 1.0. This suggests that the current policies are not consistently reaching the goal without falling into holes or getting stuck in loops.

The user mentioned that I should propose a new set of parameters each iteration, ensuring they haven't been used before to maximize information gain. Since we're at iteration 1235 out of 5000, there's still significant room for exploration but also some potential for exploitation if near-optimal policies are found.

I need to consider the trajectories provided. For example, a policy that leads the agent from state 0 (top-left) to state 4 (middle-left) might be useful, as it moves closer to the goal. However, I must ensure that each action taken doesn't lead into a hole.

Let me think about possible strategies:

1. **Greedy Approach**: For each state, choose the action that has the highest probability of moving towards the goal without falling into holes. This might involve mapping out safe paths and ensuring each step moves closer to the target.

2. **Exploration vs Exploitation**: Given that the current rewards are below 0.5, I should focus on exploration to find new policies that could potentially yield higher rewards. This means trying different actions in states that haven't been fully explored yet.

3. **Avoiding Holes**: Since holes end the episode immediately, it's crucial to identify which states are holes and ensure the policy avoids them. However, since I don't have explicit information on where the holes are, I must infer based on trajectories that resulted in failure (reward 0).

Looking at the most recent parameters and their trajectories:

- A policy with f(params) = 0.25 had a trajectory looping between states 0 and 4, indicating it might be stuck.
- Policies with lower rewards like 0.10 or 0.00 suggest that some actions lead to holes or getting trapped.

To improve, I should propose parameters that encourage movement towards the goal while avoiding loops and dangerous areas. For instance:

- From state 0 (top-left), moving right or down could be safer.
- From states near the edges, actions that move inward might prevent falling into holes.
- Ensuring that from each state, there's a path that progresses towards state 15 without revisiting previous states.

Let me attempt to construct such a policy:

- For states in the top row (0-3), encourage moving right or down.
- For middle rows, prioritize actions that move closer to the bottom-right corner.
- Ensure that from each state, at least one action leads towards the goal and doesn't risk falling into a hole.

Given the constraints of not repeating previous parameter sets, I'll design a new set that slightly varies from the top performers but adjusts certain states to encourage different paths.

After considering these factors, here's a proposed set of parameters:

params[0]: 1, params[1]: 3, params[2]: 1, params[3]: 3, params[4]: 0, params[5]: 1, params[6]: 1, params[7]: 2, params[8]: 3, params[9]: 1, params[10]: 2, params[11]: 3, params[12]: 1, params[13]: 3, params[14]: 2, params[15]: 3
