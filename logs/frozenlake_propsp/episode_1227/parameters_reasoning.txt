You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. It's a 4x4 grid with some holes and slippery states. The goal is to reach state 15, which gives a reward of +1, while all other states give 0. Holes are dangerous because stepping on them ends the episode.

First, I need to understand how the policy works. Each state (from 0 to 15) has an action associated with it, represented by params[i]. The actions are 0, 1, 2, or 3, each corresponding to different possible movements. But because of the slippery nature, taking an action doesn't guarantee moving in that direction; instead, there's a 33% chance for three possible directions.

Looking at the trajectories provided, I can see that many policies are getting stuck or falling into holes. For example, some trajectories loop around without reaching the goal. So, my task is to find a policy that avoids these loops and efficiently navigates towards state 15.

The top-performing params have rewards around 0.35-0.45, which is still way below the target of 1.0. This suggests that the current policies aren't consistently reaching the goal without falling into holes. The recent attempts are even worse, with some getting zero reward, indicating they're either stuck or falling into holes immediately.

I should consider what makes a policy optimal here. It needs to balance exploration and exploitation—avoiding holes while moving towards the goal. Maybe certain states have high risk of falling into holes, so their actions need careful selection.

For example, state 0 is the top-left corner. If I set params[0] to 1, it suggests moving right, down, or left with equal probability. But perhaps moving right is better because it's towards the goal. Alternatively, if there's a hole adjacent in one direction, maybe it's safer to avoid that action.

Looking at state 15, which is the goal, I should ensure that any state leading directly into it has actions that reliably move there. Also, states near holes need cautious policies to prevent falling in.

I think a good approach would be to set up a policy where each state directs towards the goal while avoiding known hole positions. Maybe using deterministic actions when possible and probabilistic ones when necessary for exploration.

Wait, but since the environment is slippery, deterministic actions won't work because the actual movement is random. So, I need to choose actions that maximize the chance of moving towards the goal without stepping into holes. That might involve choosing actions that have a higher probability of moving in the desired direction or avoiding risky moves.

For instance, in state 14 (which is just left of 15), setting action 2 would mean moving up, right, or down. Since moving right leads to 15, which gives the reward, maybe action 2 is good because there's a chance to move right and achieve the goal.

Another consideration: states on the edges have fewer possible moves. For example, state 0 can't move left or down (depending on how it's mapped), so actions might be limited in terms of directions they can take.

I also need to check which states are holes. From the trajectories, I can infer that certain states are holes because stepping on them ends the episode. For example, if a trajectory stops at state 6, maybe state 6 is a hole.

So, for each state, I should determine what actions lead towards the goal and avoid actions that could land in holes. Since the environment's holes aren't explicitly given, I have to deduce them from the trajectories provided.

In the recent attempts, some policies led to getting stuck or falling into holes quickly. So, perhaps changing certain states' actions to more cautious ones would help.

For example, if state 7 is a hole, then any action that could lead there should be avoided. So, in neighboring states like 4,5,6,8, I need to choose actions that don't have a chance of moving into state 7.

But without knowing the exact holes, it's tricky. Maybe I can infer them based on where trajectories end. If many policies fall into the same state, that might indicate a hole there.

Looking at the recent params and their trajectories, some end in loops or get stuck. So perhaps adjusting the actions in those states to break the loop would help.

Overall, my goal is to propose a new set of params that either explores new territory (if rewards are low) or optimizes around the current best (if rewards are approaching 1.0). Since current rewards are below 0.5, I should focus on exploration—changing parameters in ways that haven't been tried before to gather more information about which actions lead to success.

So, for each state, I'll choose an action different from previous attempts, especially focusing on states where the current policies aren't performing well. This way, I can maximize information gain and potentially find a path towards the goal without falling into holes.
