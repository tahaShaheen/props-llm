You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.

First, the environment is a 4x4 grid where each cell represents a state from 0 to 15. The agent can move in four directions: left, down, right, up, but because the ice is slippery, each action leads to one of three possible moves with equal probability. So for example, if the agent chooses action 0 (move left), it actually has a 1/3 chance to go down, left, or up.

The goal is state 15, which gives a reward of +1. All other states give 0. There are also holes that end the episode if stepped on, but their exact locations aren't specified here. The user provided some previous attempts and trajectories, but I need to figure out where these holes might be.

Looking at the top 6 best-performing params, they all have average rewards around 0.35 to 0.45. That's significantly below the target of 1.0, which suggests that even the best policies so far aren't consistently reaching the goal. Maybe the current policies are either falling into holes or getting stuck in loops.

In the recent attempts, some trajectories show agents staying in place for many steps (like state 0 repeatedly) or moving towards walls without progress. This indicates that the current policies might not be efficiently navigating towards the goal.

Since the agent is supposed to avoid holes based on previous trajectories, I need to ensure that each policy avoids known dangerous states. The recent params tried include various actions, but perhaps they're still leading into traps or not effectively moving toward state 15.

I should think about how to structure the policies to maximize the chance of reaching state 15 without falling into holes. Maybe focusing on policies that push towards the goal more directly would help. For instance, from states near the bottom-right, the agent should try to move right or down if possible.

Also, since each action has a probability distribution over three directions, the policy needs to account for all possibilities. So, choosing actions that have a higher chance of moving closer to the goal might be better.

Looking at the previous policies, many seem to choose action 1 and 3 frequently. Maybe varying these could lead to different outcomes. Alternatively, focusing on actions that have more upward or rightward tendencies might help navigate towards state 15.

I also notice that in some trajectories, the agent gets stuck in a loop, like moving between states without making progress. To prevent this, perhaps structuring policies so that from each state, there's at least one action leading closer to the goal.

Since I can't remember previous attempts (stateless), I need to maximize information gain by choosing params that test different paths or avoid known traps.

Maybe in this iteration, I should try a policy where most states push towards moving right or down. For example, from state 0 (top-left), action 1 (which has a mix of right, down, left) might help move towards the goal. Similarly, other states could have actions that guide the agent closer.

But since each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability, I need to ensure that even if some moves are risky, others lead towards the goal. So perhaps setting up policies where from each state, at least one of the possible moves is directly towards the goal or a safer path.

Wait, but without knowing the exact hole positions, this is tricky. Maybe focusing on avoiding states with high failure rates in previous attempts could help. For example, if certain states are often leading to holes, setting their actions to avoid those transitions.

Alternatively, considering that all top policies have f(params) below 0.45, maybe I need a more aggressive policy that takes bigger risks but has higher potential reward.

Hmm, perhaps trying a mix of right and down actions in the lower rows would help navigate towards state 15. Also, ensuring that from states near the goal, the agent is set to take actions that can reach it.

Another thought: since the environment is slippery, maybe the policy needs to be robust against these stochastic movements. So setting up policies where multiple possible moves still lead towards the goal would make sense.

I should also check if any of the previous params have high reward but weren't tried again because of statelessness. Since I can't remember, I'll treat each suggestion as a new attempt.

Perhaps in this step, to maximize information gain, I need to try a policy that explores different pathways towards the goal while avoiding obvious traps. Maybe adjusting certain states' actions to see if they lead closer or farther from the holes.

After considering all these factors, I think proposing a new set of params where each state is set to an action that has a higher chance of moving towards the goal without repeating previous attempts would be best.
