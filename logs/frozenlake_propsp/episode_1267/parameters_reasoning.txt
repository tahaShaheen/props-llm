You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the task is to find the optimal policy for a FrozenLake environment with some specific slippery movement and holes that end the episode. The goal is state 15, which gives +1 reward, and all other states give 0 except when falling into a hole.

First, I need to understand the environment setup:

- It's a 4x4 grid.
- States are numbered from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right).
- The movement is slippery: each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability. For example, moving left could send you down, left, or up.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 numbers (params[0] to params[15]), where each value is 0,1,2,3 corresponding to the four actions. The challenge is to set these parameters such that the agent maximizes its reward, which should ideally approach 1.0.

Looking at the provided information:

- The top 5 best-performing policies have rewards around 0.35-0.45.
- The most recent params tried are giving lower rewards (like 0.10 or even 0.05), suggesting that we might not be exploiting the best policies yet.

The strategy is to maximize information gain by either exploring new configurations if the current rewards are low or tweaking the best ones if they're close to optimal. Since the top reward is still below 1, I think we need to explore more.

From the trajectories provided, some patterns emerge:

- The agent tends to get stuck in loops (like moving between states without progressing towards the goal) or falling into holes.
- For example, one trajectory goes (0,1), (1,3), (2,1), etc., but doesn't reach state 15.

So, to improve, I need a policy that:

1. Avoids holes effectively by ensuring actions don't lead near them.
2. Progresses towards the goal more directly.
3. Minimizes getting stuck in loops.

Given the slippery nature, the agent's path is probabilistic. So, the policy needs to choose actions that have a higher probability of moving it closer to state 15 while avoiding areas with holes.

Looking at the grid, the right and down movements are crucial for reaching the goal. However, because of the slipperiness, each action might send the agent in three directions. Therefore, selecting actions that maximize the chance of moving towards the goal while having alternative paths if the initial direction is blocked due to slipping.

In the previous attempts, the policies have been trying different combinations but haven't reached the optimal reward. Perhaps we need to adjust certain states' actions to better navigate around holes and towards the goal.

For example:

- State 0 (top-left corner): Moving right or down should be prioritized.
- States along the edges: Actions that prevent moving into holes while progressing towards state 15.

I think focusing on the key states near the goal and ensuring their actions guide the agent closer, regardless of slipping, would help. Maybe changing some actions in critical states to more right and down movements could increase the chances of reaching state 15 without falling into holes.

After considering all this, I'll propose a new set of params that adjusts certain states to better navigate towards the goal while avoiding known hole areas based on previous trajectories.
