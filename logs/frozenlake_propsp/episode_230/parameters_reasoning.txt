You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to optimize the policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with a reward of +1, but there are holes that can end the episode. Since it's slippery, each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability.

Looking at the provided top params, most have f(params) around 0.10 to 0.20, which is much lower than the target of 1.0. That suggests we're not yet near the optimal solution. So I need to think about how to structure the policy to maximize the chance of reaching state 15 without falling into holes.

First, I should identify which states are safe and which lead to holes. From the trajectories, it seems like moving right or down towards the goal is preferable. But because of the slippery nature, actions can't be too greedy; we need policies that have a higher chance of navigating around holes.

For each state, the policy should choose an action that maximizes the probability of eventually reaching the goal without hitting a hole. Since the environment is 4x4, I might need to map out safe paths from each state.

Let me consider state 0 (top-left corner). Possible actions are 0,1,2,3. But since it's slippery, action 0 leads to down, left, or up. Left would take it to the same state or maybe a hole. Down moves towards the center. So perhaps from state 0, taking action 2 (which could move right, up, or down) might be better as moving right is towards the goal.

Wait, no—action 2's possible moves are up, right, down. From state 0, moving up isn't possible because it's on the top row. So from 0, action 0 (down, left, up) would take it to 4 (down), stay in 0 (left if possible?), or up which is invalid. Hmm, maybe action 1 is better for state 0.

Alternatively, perhaps a more systematic approach is needed. For each state, determine the best action that avoids holes and moves towards the goal as much as possible given the slipperiness.

Another thought: Since the environment has holes, it's crucial to avoid certain states. So the policy should guide the agent through safe paths that have higher probabilities of reaching the goal without hitting any holes.

Looking at the recent policies provided, many are getting stuck or falling into holes quickly, so perhaps adjusting actions to be more cautious. For example, in state 15 (goal), we don't need to do anything, but other states should lead towards it.

Wait, no—state 15 is the goal, so once reached, the episode ends with +1. So policies that can reach it reliably are better.

I think I need to construct a policy where each state's action is chosen such that, on average, it leads closer to the goal while minimizing the risk of falling into holes. Maybe using Q-learning or value iteration concepts, but since I'm supposed to propose parameters without knowing exact transitions, I have to base this on trial and error.

Looking at the top policies, some are getting trajectories like (0,1) → (4,2) → (8,2), which seems a bit meandering. Maybe there's a more direct path.

Perhaps for each state, choosing the action that has the highest probability of moving right or down, depending on where it is in the grid. For example, in the top row, moving right towards state 3 and then to 7 might be safer if those states are not holes.

Wait, but without knowing which states are holes, I have to infer from trajectories. From the recent ones, some fall into holes quickly, so perhaps certain transitions lead to them.

Alternatively, focusing on making sure that from each state, there's a high probability of moving towards the goal without getting stuck in loops or falling into holes.

Another approach: Since the environment is known except for the hole locations, maybe I can create a deterministic policy that guides the agent down and right as much as possible. But given the slipperiness, making it stochastic requires careful action selection to maximize chances.

I think I should try setting actions in such a way that each state's action tends towards moving towards the goal, considering all possible movement directions due to slippage.

For example:

- State 0: prefer moving right (action might be 2 or 1 depending on what leads more right)
- States closer to the top-right should move down and right
- Avoid actions that lead into likely hole positions based on past trajectories

But without knowing which states are holes, it's challenging. So perhaps making a policy that hedges bets by having each state choose an action that covers multiple directions but has a higher chance of avoiding holes.

Looking at the recent policies, some have high 0s and 1s, others mix in 2s and 3s. Maybe experimenting with more varied actions to see which combinations lead to better rewards.

Wait, perhaps trying to assign each state an action that maximizes the probability of moving towards the goal while minimizing the risk of falling into known problematic transitions.

Given all this, I think I should propose a policy where each state's action is chosen based on the most direct path towards the goal, considering the slippery nature. For example:

- From state 0 (top-left), action 1 might be best as it could move right.
- From state 1 (top-middle), action 3 to move down or right.
- And so on for each state.

But since I can't know the exact hole positions, perhaps a general approach is needed. Maybe making sure that from each state, there's at least one direction towards the goal and avoiding directions that have led to holes in past trajectories.

Alternatively, given the low rewards so far, maybe it's better to try more exploratory actions rather than exploiting current policies. So, propose a new set of parameters that are significantly different from previous ones but still structured to move towards the goal.

I think I'll go with setting each state to choose an action that primarily moves towards the goal while allowing for some exploration. For example:

- States in the top row: prefer right or down
- Middle states: prefer down or right based on position
- Bottom row: push towards rightmost column

But without specific hole locations, it's tricky. Maybe assigning each state an action that has a higher chance of moving in the desired direction while considering all possible moves.

Given that, I'll propose a new set of params where each state is assigned an action that tends to move towards the goal, but with some variance to handle slippage and avoid holes.
