You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment with a 4x4 grid. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) without falling into any holes. The tricky part is that the environment is slippery, meaning each action has a 33% chance of moving in one of three directions.

First, I need to understand how the policy works. Each state (from 0 to 15) maps to an action (0-3). My task is to determine which action each state should take to maximize the reward, ideally getting as close to 1.0 as possible (which means reaching the goal).

Looking at the history provided, the top-performing policies have average rewards around 0.45. That's not very high, so I think we're in an exploratory phase where we need to gather more information about which actions lead to success or failure.

The trajectories show that some policies are getting stuck in loops or falling into holes. For example, one trajectory goes from (0,1) to (4,1) and then gets stuck at state 8. This suggests that the policy might be leading the agent towards a hole or an area with no progress.

I should consider which actions can help avoid these pitfalls. Maybe certain states need different actions to navigate around holes. For instance, if moving right from state 0 leads to a hole, perhaps action 1 (which has a chance to move left, down, or right) isn't the best choice. Alternatively, maybe action 3 would allow more flexibility.

Another approach is to ensure that each step moves the agent closer to the goal. For example, states near the bottom-right corner should encourage moving towards state 15. So, for state 14 (the cell above 15), the optimal action might be down (action 0 or others that can lead there). Similarly, state 12 (bottom-left) would need an action that moves right.

I also notice that some policies are not moving towards the goal effectively. Maybe adjusting certain states to push more in the direction of the goal could help. For example, if a state is on the top row, it should try to move down rather than left or right.

Considering the slippery nature, each action has a 33% chance for three directions. So, even if the policy suggests moving right, there's a chance the agent might go up, down, or left instead. Therefore, the policy needs to be robust against these variations and still guide the agent towards the goal.

Perhaps I should look at each state individually and decide which action increases the probability of reaching state 15 without hitting any holes. For example:

- State 0 (top-left): Maybe action 1 (right, down, left) could help move towards the right or down.
- State 3: If moving up isn't safe, maybe action 3 to try right, up, or left.
- Middle states might need a mix of actions that balance between moving towards the goal and avoiding holes.

Given that all previous attempts haven't reached the optimal reward yet, I should suggest a new set of parameters that explores different paths. Maybe changing some key states' actions to push the agent in new directions could reveal better outcomes or help avoid holes.

Finally, since we're in an exploratory phase (rewards are below 1), I'll propose a policy that changes several state actions to try new trajectories, ensuring they don't repeat previous attempts and cover more of the grid.
