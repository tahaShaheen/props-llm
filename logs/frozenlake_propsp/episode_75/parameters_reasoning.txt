You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment to maximize the reward. Let me start by understanding the problem deeply.

First, the environment is a 4x4 grid with states numbered from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). The goal is state 15, which gives +1 reward. All other states give 0. There are holes that end the episode if stepped on, but their locations aren't specified yet. The slippery nature means each action leads to one of three directions with equal probability.

The policy is a function mapping each state (0-15) to an action (0-3). My job is to find the optimal params array where each element corresponds to the best action for that state, ensuring that the agent avoids holes and reaches the goal efficiently.

Looking at the provided data, I see several previous attempts with their rewards. Most have f(params) around 0.10 or lower. The trajectories show various paths, sometimes ending in falling into a hole or reaching the goal. For instance, some policies lead to states like (0,3) repeatedly, which might be a hole since it ends the episode.

Since the goal is to reach state 15 with high probability and avoid holes, I need to design a policy that directs the agent towards state 15 while steering clear of known or potential holes. The optimal reward should approach 1.0, so I'm looking for a policy that almost always reaches the goal.

In previous attempts, many policies seem to get stuck in loops or end up in states that are likely holes. For example, a trajectory like (0,3) repeating suggests that action might lead to a hole. So, perhaps adjusting certain actions can prevent getting stuck there.

I should consider how each state's action affects movement. Since the environment is slippery, choosing an action that increases the chances of moving towards 15 despite the randomness is key. For instance, in state 0 (top-left), choosing right or down could be better as they move closer to 15.

Looking at the recent policies, some have params[0] set to 1 or 2, which might correspond to actions that move right or down. However, their rewards are still low, indicating that these policies aren't reliably reaching the goal.

To improve, maybe I should focus on creating a policy that has deterministic-like behavior despite the environment's stochasticity. For example, in each state, choose an action that maximizes the chance of moving towards 15, considering all possible outcomes.

I also need to avoid actions that could lead to holes. If certain states are known or suspected to be holes, their corresponding params should have actions that don't step on them. From the trajectories, it seems some states are leading to failures, so I can infer those might be holes and adjust accordingly.

Perhaps a greedy approach towards 15 would work best. Each state's action should be chosen to maximize the probability of eventually reaching 15. For example, in state 0 (top-left), moving right or down is better because those directions lead closer to 15.

I'll try constructing such a policy. Let me map each state to an action that generally moves towards 15. For instance:

- State 0: move right (action 1) since it's the first step towards 15.
- State 1: moving down or right could be good, depending on proximity.
- Continue this logic for all states.

But I also need to account for the slippery nature. So each action might not directly lead where intended, but choosing actions that statistically bring the agent closer is essential.

After considering these factors, I'll propose a new set of params where each state's action is chosen to move towards 15 as much as possible, avoiding actions that could loop or lead to potential holes.
