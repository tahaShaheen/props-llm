You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I need to help find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward by reaching state 15, avoiding holes. The environment is slippery, meaning each action has a 33% chance of going in one of three directions.

First, let me understand the setup. It's a 4x4 grid, with states numbered from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). Holes are present but their locations aren't specified yet; I need to figure them out based on trajectories provided.

The policy is an array of 16 actions, each being 0-3. The agent's reward is +1 upon reaching state 15, else 0. So the optimal policy should get as many rewards close to 1 as possible.

Looking at the top 4 best params, their average reward is around 0.25-0.35. That's much lower than the target of 1.0, so I'm in the exploration phase since rewards are far below optimal.

The recent params tried aren't performing well, with some getting zero reward. So perhaps those policies either fall into holes or get stuck in loops.

I should think about which states are likely to be near the goal and how to navigate towards them while avoiding holes. Maybe certain actions from specific states lead to higher success rates.

For example, state 14 is just one step away from 15 (if moving right). If I set params[14] to action that moves right, it would reach the goal. Similarly, other states near 15 should have actions towards it.

But considering the slippery nature, each action can lead in three directions with equal probability. So from state i, choosing an action that has a higher chance of moving towards the goal despite the slipperiness is key.

Looking at the trajectories provided:

- The first top param's trajectory went (0,1) → (4,2) → (8,2). That didn't reach 15 but got stuck somewhere.
- Another top param had a short trajectory ending in a hole or goal quickly.
- Recent params seem to get stuck or loop.

So I need to propose a new set of params that explore different paths and possibly avoid the holes identified through previous trajectories.

Maybe focus on setting actions that move towards 15 from key states. For instance, state 0 (top-left) should perhaps move right (action 1), which could lead it to move right, down, or left with equal chance.

Wait, action 0 for state 0 is [down, left, up]. Maybe moving down is better to get closer to the goal? But since actions are probabilistic, I need to choose actions that have a path towards the goal.

Alternatively, from state 12 (the bottom-left), moving right twice would reach 14 and then 15. So setting params[12] to action that moves right is crucial.

But without knowing where the holes are, it's challenging. Maybe looking at the recent trajectories can help identify which states are leading to failures.

In the recent params:

- The third most recent param tried had a trajectory ending in (9,3), (10,1). That suggests maybe state 10 leads to a hole when action 1 is taken. Or perhaps certain actions from state 8 or 9 lead towards holes.

I think I should vary the actions across different states to see new trajectories and identify holes better. Maybe try setting some states to always move right or down, which are more goal-oriented.

Alternatively, since rewards are low, focusing on exploration might be better. Changing several params to explore new paths rather than exploiting current policies that aren't working well.

So I'll propose a new set of params where key states near the goal have actions moving towards it. For example:

- State 14: action right (2)
- State 13: action down or right
- State 10: action right or down
- Other states might be adjusted to move towards these goal areas.

But without knowing exact hole positions, this is a bit of guesswork. To maximize information gain, I need to propose params that explore different paths and possibly new states that haven't been tried before, helping identify holes more effectively.

Perhaps in this iteration, I'll set several states to action 2 (right) or 3 (up), which might help navigate towards the goal while avoiding previously problematic areas.
