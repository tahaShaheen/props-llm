You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

Do NOT output anything else. No explanation, no reasoning, nothing.



LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out what the optimal policy should be for this FrozenLake environment. So, from what I understand, it's a 4x4 grid with some holes and slippery movement. The goal is to get to state 15 without falling into any holes. 

First, I need to understand how the slipping works. Each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability. For example, if I take action 0 (left), the agent can move down, left, or up each with a 1/3 chance. Similarly for other actions. This makes it tricky because even if you choose an action, there's uncertainty in where you'll end up.

The policy is defined by params[0] to params[15], each being 0-3, indicating the action taken from that state. The agent needs to choose actions that maximize the chance of reaching the goal without falling into holes.

Looking at the top-performing params provided, they have f(params) around 0.45, which is below the target of 1.0. That suggests we need a better strategy to reach the goal more reliably.

I notice in the recent trials, some policies are getting stuck or not reaching the goal efficiently. For example, one trajectory loops between states without progress. So maybe the current policies aren't taking optimal paths towards state 15.

To improve, I should focus on creating a policy that directs the agent towards the goal (state 15) while avoiding holes. Since movement is slippery, each action choice must consider all possible outcomes to ensure they don't lead into holes and increase the chances of moving closer to the goal.

Let me think about key states:

- State 0: top-left corner. From here, possible actions should be chosen to move towards state 1 or towards the right or down.
- States along the edges might have limited movement options, so their policies need to carefully choose which direction to push for maximum progress.

For each state, I should determine the best action that, considering the slippery nature, maximizes the probability of moving closer to the goal and avoids holes. 

Since all previous params haven't achieved the optimal reward yet, it's time to try a new configuration. Maybe changing some key states' actions could help the agent find a path towards state 15 more effectively.

I'll start by trying to adjust the policies for states near the top-right, as those are closer to the goal. For example, state 3 (top-right) should push towards state 7 or move down if possible. Similarly, states in the third row should focus on moving right or down depending on their position.

I'll also ensure that actions from each state don't lead into known holes. From previous trajectories, it seems like some paths are getting stuck near holes, so adjusting those policies to avoid such areas might help.

After considering all this, I'll propose a new set of params where key states have actions aimed directly towards the goal while avoiding risky moves that could land in holes.
