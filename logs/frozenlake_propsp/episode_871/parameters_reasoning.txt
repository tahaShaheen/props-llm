You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I understand that the environment is a 4x4 grid with states numbered from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). The goal is state 15, which gives a reward of +1, and all other states give 0. There are holes in some states that end the episode if stepped on.

The agent's actions aren't straightforward because of the slippery nature. Each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability. So, choosing an action doesn't guarantee moving in one direction; it can vary.

Looking at the previous top-performing policies and their rewards, most are around 0.25-0.45. The optimal should be close to 1.0, so we need to improve.

The recent attempts have shown that some policies get stuck or fall into holes. For example, the last policy had a reward of 0.20 and ended in a hole. Another got 0.00, which is worse. So, I need to adjust the policy to avoid these traps.

I think the key is to ensure that from each state, the chosen action leads towards the goal while avoiding holes. Maybe certain states should have specific actions to navigate safely.

Looking at the grid:

- State 15 is the goal.
- States around it (like 14 and 11) are close.
- Holes are in some positions that need to be identified.

From the trajectories, I can see where agents are failing. For example, starting from state 0 with action 3 might lead towards a hole or not progress well.

I should map out each state's optimal action based on proximity to the goal and avoiding holes. Perhaps states closer to the right (column-wise) should move right or down, while others adjust accordingly.

Also, considering that actions can cause drifts in three directions, choosing an action that maximizes the chance of moving towards the goal without hitting a hole is crucial.

Let me try drafting some potential changes:

- From state 0: Maybe action 3 (right) to move towards higher-numbered states.
- State 1: Action 2 or 3 might help move right or down.
- States near the bottom-right should push towards 15 without stepping on holes.

I need to ensure that each action in the policy avoids leading into known holes. Maybe for certain states, like those near the top-right, moving down is safer than right if a hole is present above.

After considering these factors, I'll propose a new set of parameters that adjusts actions to navigate towards the goal more effectively and avoid the pitfalls observed in previous attempts.
