You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment using reinforcement learning. The goal is to reach state 15, which is the bottom right corner of the grid. Each action taken from a state leads to an equal probability distribution among three directions if it's the slippery condition, otherwise, it follows the other two.

First, I need to understand the policy parameters. There are 16 possible states, each with its own action assigned by the params array. The goal is to find the best combination of actions (params) that maximize the expected reward over time without falling into any holes in the map. This means avoiding certain states where stepping on them might end the game.

I remember from the examples provided that some parameters led to lower rewards, but others didn't fall into those holes and had higher rewards. The optimal policy should be somewhere around 0.35 as seen in one of the examples with f(params) = 0.45.

The agent should use a method like Q-Learning or SARSA to explore the environment. Since it's a grid, maybe using a Monte Carlo approach would help, where we simulate many episodes and learn from each episode's reward history.

Wait, but the policy is based on the params array which maps states 0-15 to actions 0-3. I need to find the best combination that ensures exploration of all possible paths without bias towards certain areas.

I think a good approach would be to use SARSA with experience replay or Q-Learning with Monte Carlo episodes, gradually improving the policy based on the rewards obtained from each step. Also, considering the slippery action condition where from some states, all actions have equal probability except for the hole states.

But I'm not entirely sure how to set up the algorithm. Maybe start by initializing all params to 0.5 and then adjust them based on the average reward per state. After several iterations, the policy should stabilize around the optimal one.

I also need to ensure that each state's action choice doesn't lead the agent into any hole states, which are not part of the goal. The examples provided don't include such states, so I assume all other states are passable unless otherwise mentioned.

So, my plan is: set up an algorithm with SARSA or Q-Learning, randomly sample a number of episodes (like 1000), calculate the average reward for each state-action pair based on those samples. Then, update the policy parameters accordingly. After each iteration, check if the best f(params) improves upon previous records and keep track to avoid getting stuck in local optima.

Wait, but without specific code, how do I know which params will lead to a better policy? Maybe I should try several combinations from the example that achieved 0.45 or higher. For instance, in one of the examples, params[0]:2, others are set in a way that avoids holes and explores various paths.

Alternatively, perhaps using a grid search approach where each parameter is tested for all possible values (0-3), but that would be too slow computationally. Instead, I should adjust the parameters based on their average rewards during exploration.

I think the key here is to balance exploration with exploitation. The policy should sometimes exploit the best-known action for each state while occasionally exploring new actions to find better paths. This way, it can avoid local optima and find a globally optimal path.

In terms of implementation, perhaps using a simple iterative approach where after each set number of steps (like 100), I record the average reward per state. Then, based on that, update the policy parameters for the next step. The value of params[i] represents the action to take from state i, so adjusting these values according to their rewards can improve over time.

I also need to make sure not to choose any param set that has been used before (the top 10 in the examples) and aim for around 0.45 or higher as per the given example.
