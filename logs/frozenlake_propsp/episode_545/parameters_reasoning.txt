You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, let's try to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. So, the goal is to get from any starting state to state 15, which gives a reward of +1. All other states give 0, and there are holes that end the episode if stepped on.

First, I need to understand how the movement works. Since it's slippery, each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability. For example, taking action 0 (left) can lead to down, left, or up. This makes the environment stochastic, which complicates things because we can't predict exactly where we'll end up.

Looking at the state layout: rows are 0-3, then 4-7, 8-11, and 12-15. The goal is 15. So starting from any position, we need to navigate towards the bottom-right corner, avoiding holes.

The policy is an array of 16 numbers, each corresponding to a state (0-15). Each number is 0-3, indicating the action to take in that state. The challenge is to set these actions such that the agent maximizes its chance of reaching state 15 without falling into any holes.

From the provided data, the top-performing policies have rewards around 0.20-0.30, which is below the target of 1.0. So, there's room for improvement.

The most recent params tried were:
params[0]: 3; ... leading to f(params)=0.00 and a trajectory that didn't reach the goal.
Another was params with all actions set to 2 or 3, but only got 0.15 reward.

I notice that in some top params, certain states are taking specific actions. For example, state 0 (top-left) is often set to action 1 or 2. Maybe trying different actions for key states like 0, 1, and others near the edges could help explore new paths.

Since we're supposed to maximize information gain, I should choose a policy that's significantly different from previous ones to see if it can reach higher rewards. Perhaps changing the actions in states around the goal area (like 12-15) might increase the chances of reaching state 15.

I'll consider setting params[14] and params[15] to specific actions. Since state 15 is the goal, but we can't take any action once there. So, maybe for states leading to 15, like 12 (bottom-left), taking right or down might help.

Let me try creating a new policy where:
- For states near the bottom-right, set actions that encourage moving towards state 15.
- Maybe set params[14] = 3 (right) so from state 14 (which is one step left of goal), it can move right to reach 15.
- Similarly, for state 12, set action down or right.

But I also need to ensure that the policy doesn't lead into holes. So perhaps setting certain states to stay in place or move towards safe directions might help.

Alternatively, maybe a more systematic approach: look at each state and decide which action would best avoid holes and head towards the goal, considering the stochastic movement.

For example:
- State 0 (top-left): possible actions could be down or right. But since it's slippery, taking action 1 (right) might have a chance to go right, but also left or down.
- Maybe setting params[0] = 3, which for action 3 (left) has equal probability of up, left, or right.

Wait, action 3 is [up, left, right]. So taking action 3 from state 0 would have a 1/3 chance to go up (invalid), left (state -1, which probably stays in place?), or right (to state 1). Hmm, that might be risky. Alternatively, action 2 for state 0 is [up, right, down], which could potentially move right with some probability.

Alternatively, setting params[0] = 1, which gives right, down, left. That way, from state 0, there's a chance to go right (state 1), down (state 4), or stay in place if invalid.

I think I need to experiment with different actions for key states. Let me try setting params[0] = 2 (action 2: up, right, down). From state 0, this could move right to state 1, down to state 4, or up which might stay in place or go back.

Similarly, set params[1] = 3, which would allow movement from state 1 to states 2 (right), 4 (down), or 0 (left). But since state 0 is the start, maybe moving down is better towards the goal.

Continuing this way for other states. Maybe setting some states to move towards the right and down directions more often.

After considering all these factors, I think a good approach is to set actions that generally push the agent towards the bottom-right while avoiding holes. So, I'll construct a new params array where each state's action is chosen to have a higher probability of moving towards the goal without stepping into known holes.
