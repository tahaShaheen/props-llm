You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, let me try to figure this out. I'm supposed to help find the global optimal policy for a FrozenLake environment with some specific parameters. The goal is to reach state 15, which gives a reward of +1, while avoiding holes that end the episode.

First, understanding the environment: it's a 4x4 grid, so states are numbered from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). Actions are slippery—when you choose an action, there's a 33% chance to go in one of three directions. The policy is defined by an array of 16 numbers, each between 0-3 indicating the action for that state.

Looking at the provided top and recent params, I see that some policies have been tried but aren't performing well. For example, a policy with f(params) = 0.35 isn't great, especially since the target is around 1.0.

I need to think about how to structure the policy to maximize the chance of reaching state 15 without falling into holes. The key here is ensuring that from each state, the chosen action doesn't lead into a hole. Also, given the slippery nature, the agent might not always take the intended path, so the policy must account for multiple possible movements.

Let me consider what's needed to get from any state to 15. The optimal path likely involves moving towards the bottom-right. However, due to the slipperiness, the agent needs a strategy that gradually navigates towards the goal while avoiding holes.

Looking at the top-performing params provided earlier, they have some patterns but aren't yielding high rewards. Maybe I need to find a way for each state to choose an action that, on average, leads closer to 15, considering all possible outcomes.

I should also consider that certain states are more risky than others. For example, being in the same row or column as the goal might be beneficial. The agent should prefer actions that increase the likelihood of moving towards the goal, even if it's a probabilistic outcome.

Perhaps I can design the policy so that from each state, the action chosen directs the agent toward the right or down, which are the directions leading to the goal. But since the environment is slippery, choosing an action that has multiple possible movements requires careful selection.

Let me think about specific states:

- State 0 (top-left): Moving right, down, or up might be risky. Right leads towards state 1, down to state 4. Choosing right could be a way forward.
- State 1: From here, moving right (to state 2), down (state 5), or left (back to 0). Need to balance between exploring and progressing.
- Similarly, each state should have an action that pushes the agent towards higher-numbered states, ideally towards 15.

Another consideration is avoiding loops. Some of the recent trajectories show agents getting stuck in cycles, which reduces their reward because they don't reach the goal quickly.

I also need to ensure that the policy doesn't lead the agent into any holes. Without knowing the exact positions of the holes, I have to make educated guesses based on previous trajectories. If certain actions from specific states led to holes, those should be avoided.

Given that the average reward is low, perhaps the current policies aren't efficiently navigating towards the goal or are falling into holes too often. I need a policy that not only moves toward the goal but also minimizes the risk of hitting a hole.

One approach could be to have each state's action chosen based on the direction most likely to progress towards 15, considering the possible outcomes. For example, in states near the bottom or right edges, the agent should prefer moving down or right, respectively.

Let me try drafting such a policy:

- For states closer to the goal (like 12, 13, 14, 15), actions should be designed to stay on track.
- For other states, choose actions that have the highest probability of leading towards the goal.

Looking at the recent attempts, some policies are getting stuck or falling into holes. I need a way to break those cycles and ensure progress.

Perhaps setting up a policy where each state's action is chosen to maximize the chance of moving right or down. For example:

- States in the top row: prefer right or down.
- Middle rows: move towards the bottom-right as much as possible.

I'll outline this approach, ensuring that from each state, the action selected increases the likelihood of moving closer to 15. This might involve choosing actions that have a higher probability of leading towards the goal considering all possible outcomes due to slipperiness.
