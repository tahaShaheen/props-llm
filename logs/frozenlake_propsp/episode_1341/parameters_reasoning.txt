You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

Do NOT output anything else. No explanation, no reasoning, nothing.



LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with a reward of +1 while avoiding holes. Since it's slippery, each action has three possible outcomes with equal probability.

Looking at the top-performing params, most have f(params) around 0.45. That means the best policies so far are averaging about 0.45 rewards per episode. The global optimal should be around 1.0, so we're still a ways off.

The recent params tried include some that gave very low or zero reward. For example, one policy led to an immediate fall into a hole (f(params): 0.00). So I need to make sure the new policy avoids those dangerous states.

In the top params, many have similar structures where they take specific actions in certain states. For instance, state 0 often takes action 1 or 2, which might be moving right or up/down. But since it's slippery, these actions can lead to different outcomes.

I notice that some states near the goal (like 12-15) have high rewards when they reach 15. So focusing on getting policies that reliably navigate towards state 15 without falling into holes is key.

Maybe I should try a policy where from each state, the action chosen leads towards the right or down direction more often, considering the slippery nature. But since actions are probabilistic, it's about choosing actions that maximize the chance of moving closer to the goal without stepping on holes.

Looking at recent attempts, some policies didn't reach the goal and fell into traps. I should adjust those states where the policy is failing to avoid such outcomes.

I think a good approach now is to tweak the best-performing policies slightly to see if we can push the reward closer to 1.0. Maybe changing actions in critical states that are leading to holes or not progressing towards the goal.

For example, in state 4 (top of second column), action 0 is chosen in some top params which might move down, but maybe switching to another action could help avoid a hole. Similarly, in state 6, perhaps a different action would lead more reliably towards the goal.

I should also consider states near the holes and ensure that the policy doesn't take any action that could cause the agent to step into them with non-zero probability.

So, I'll create a new params array where for each state, especially those leading towards the goal, I select actions that have a higher chance of moving towards the right or down, while avoiding actions that might lead to holes. I'll make sure these changes are distinct from previous attempts to maximize information gain and explore further.

After considering all this, here's my proposed new params configuration:
</think>

params[0]: 1, params[1]: 3, params[2]: 1, params[3]: 3, params[4]: 0, params[5]: 1, params[6]: 2, params[7]: 1, params[8]: 3, params[9]: 1, params[10]: 0, params[11]: 2, params[12]: 1, params[13]: 3, params[14]: 2, params[15]: 3
