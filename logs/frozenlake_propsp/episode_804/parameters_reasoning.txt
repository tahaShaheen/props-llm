You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out the next step in optimizing the FrozenLake environment's policy. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The environment is a 4x4 grid where the agent can move in four directions, but due to slippiness, each action leads to three possible outcomes with equal probability. The goal is state 15 (bottom right corner), which gives a reward of +1. Holes are present, and stepping on them ends the episode.

The policy is represented by an array 'params' where each element corresponds to the action taken in that state. The challenge is to find the optimal set of actions that maximizes the average reward over 20 episodes, without revisiting previous parameter configurations.

Looking at the provided data, the top-performing policies have rewards around 0.35-0.45, which are far below the target of 1.0. This suggests we're in the exploration phase since the rewards aren't close to optimal yet.

In the most recent trials, several parameters were tried but didn't yield high rewards. For example, a policy with params[0]=2 and others varied resulted in a reward of 0.05. Another had a slightly better reward of 0.15 but still not near the target.

Since we're in the exploration phase, I need to propose a new set of parameters that haven't been tried before. The key is to explore different paths towards the goal while avoiding holes.

Let me consider how each state should behave. For example:

- State 0 (top-left) might benefit from moving right or down to head towards the goal.
- States near the edges might have higher risks of falling into holes, so actions should be chosen carefully.
- The agent needs a strategy that can navigate through possible slippages without getting stuck.

Looking at previous parameters, many had params[0]=1 or 2. Maybe trying a different action for state 0 could help. Let's say we set params[0] to 3 (move left, up, or right). But wait, moving left from state 0 would take it out of bounds, so the actual movement might be adjusted by the environment.

Alternatively, perhaps setting certain states to move towards the center or in a way that reduces risk. For example, params[1] could be set to 3 (right, up, down) which gives flexibility.

I need to create a new configuration where each state's action is unique from previous attempts and has a good chance of reaching the goal while minimizing hole risks.

After considering these factors, I'll propose a new set of parameters that are distinct from the ones seen so far. Let's say:

params[0] = 1 (action right), params[1]=2, etc., but ensuring each state has an action not tried before in this specific combination.
