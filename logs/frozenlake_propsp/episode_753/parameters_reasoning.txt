You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me try to understand what's going on here.

First, the environment is a 4x4 grid where each state can be represented by numbers from 0 to 15. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) and get a reward of +1. All other states give 0 except for the holes which end the episode with no reward.

The agent's actions are slippery, meaning when it takes an action, there's a 33% chance it goes in one of three directions. So each action has some uncertainty. The policy is a function that maps each state to an action (0-3), and we need to find the best such mapping.

Looking at the problem, I see that the user has provided some top params and recent ones along with their rewards. The highest reward so far is around 0.45, which is still below 1.0, indicating that we haven't reached the optimal policy yet.

Since the global optimal should give a reward of about 1.0, meaning it's almost always reaching the goal without falling into holes, I need to propose params that guide the agent towards state 15 while avoiding holes.

Looking at the recent params and trajectories, many end in loops or get stuck in holes. For example, some trajectories go from (0,3) multiple times, indicating they might be getting stuck moving left or right but not progressing downward.

So, I need to adjust the policy so that each state directs towards a path that leads closer to 15 without risk of falling into a hole. Maybe focusing on pushing states towards the bottom-right direction more and avoiding actions that could lead into holes.

I should consider what actions each state takes currently and where they might be leading. For instance, if state 0 (top-left) is taking action 1, which moves it right, down, or left with equal chance. Maybe changing this to a different action could help it move towards the goal more directly.

Another approach is to ensure that once the agent gets closer to the goal, it has actions that will guide it there without slipping into holes. For example, states near 15 should have actions that push them right or down as much as possible.

I also need to make sure that all proposed params are unique and haven't been used before, to maximize exploration since we're not yet close to the optimal reward.

After considering these factors, I'll try to adjust some key states. For example, state 0 might benefit from moving right more, or perhaps a different action that leads it towards the bottom-right direction. Similarly, other states should be adjusted to navigate around holes and towards the goal.

Let me outline possible changes:

- State 0: Maybe action 3 (left, up, right). But left would take it back, so maybe better to choose an action that could move down or right.
Wait, looking at action definitions:
Action 0 leads to [down, left, up]
Action 1: [right, down, left]
Action 2: [up, right, down]
Action 3: [left, up, right]

So for state 0 (top-left), taking action 1 would allow it to go right or down with some chance. Maybe that's better than action 0 which could send it left or up.

Similarly, states on the edges should have actions that don't push them into holes. For example, if a state is in a column without any holes below, moving down might be safe.

I'll need to map out possible paths and see where each policy leads. Maybe using a tool or drawing the grid would help visualize which actions lead towards the goal.

Since I can't remember previous attempts due to being stateless, I should aim for params that are as different as possible from what's been tried before, especially since we're in the exploration phase.

So, considering all this, here's an attempt at a new set of params. Let me assign each state an action that would guide towards the goal while avoiding risky moves:

- State 0: Action 1 (right or down)
- State 1: Maybe action 3 to go up or right
Wait, but I need to check what actions lead where.

Alternatively, perhaps states in the top row should move right until they reach state 3, then move down. But with the slippery nature, it's hard to plan exact paths.

I'll try to set each state to push towards the goal as much as possible without getting stuck. For example:

- States on the top row (0-3): Action 1 or 2 to move right or down
- Middle states: Actions that move towards the bottom-right
- States near the bottom-right should have actions that lead them to state 15.

I think I'll proceed by setting most states to action 3, as it allows movement in directions that could get closer. But need to check for each state.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to set each state's action to one that has the highest chance of moving towards the goal without falling into holes. For example:

- State 0: Action 1 (right or down)
- States on top row except 3: Action 1
- State 3: Action 2 (down, right, up) but maybe better to go down
Wait, no, because action 2 allows moving down, which would take it closer.

Alternatively, perhaps setting states in the first column to move down, and others to move right. But considering the slippery nature, they might not always go that way.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for patterns in the existing params that didn't work well and adjust accordingly.

Looking at previous top params, many have high values but still low rewards. So perhaps their paths are leading into holes or loops.

Maybe focusing on setting states near the bottom to move right, and those on the right side to move down. For example:

- States 12 (bottom-left): Action 3 (right, up, left). But moving right would take it towards state 13, which is not the goal.
Wait, no. State 15 is the bottom-right, so from 14, moving right would reach 15.

Alternatively, perhaps setting states to move in a way that gets them closer to 15 step by step.

But given time constraints and the need to propose a new set, I'll try to make sure each state has an action that could lead it towards the goal without obvious risks. For example:

- States on the top-left (0) should go right or down.
- Middle states should move towards the bottom-right.
- Near the end, ensure actions that reach 15.

I think I'll set most states to action 3 except where moving left might be necessary to avoid holes. But without knowing hole positions exactly, it's tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps setting all states to action 2 or 3, which have a mix of directions including down and right, which could help navigate towards the goal.

In the end, I'll propose a new set of params that varies from previous attempts, focusing on moving towards the goal while avoiding obvious risky moves. Let me try this configuration:

params[0]: 1, params[1]: 3, params[2]: 1, params[3]: 3, params[4]: 2, params[5]: 1, params[6]: 1, params[7]: 3, params[8]: 3, params[9]: 1, params[10]: 2, params[11]: 1, params[12]: 2, params[13]: 3, params[14]: 3, params[15]: 3
