You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. It's a 4x4 grid, and the goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right corner) without falling into any holes. The agent can move in four directions, but because of the slippery nature, each action leads to one of three possible moves with equal probability.

First, I need to understand the environment better. The states are numbered from 0 to 15, representing their positions. The top row is 0-3, then 4-7, 8-11, and 12-15 for the bottom row. Holes are present in some states, but I don't know exactly where they are. However, from the trajectories provided, I can infer that certain actions lead to falls.

Looking at the previous policies and their rewards, it seems like most of them aren't performing well, with rewards around 0.2-0.3, which is much lower than the target of 1.0. This suggests that the current policies either aren't reaching the goal or are falling into holes too often.

I need to come up with a policy that guides the agent towards state 15 while avoiding holes. Since the environment is slippery, the agent's actions don't directly lead to the intended move but instead have a 33% chance of each possible direction. So, I should design the policy such that from each state, the optimal action (the one with the highest chance of moving towards the goal) is chosen, considering the probabilistic nature.

I think the best approach is to use some form of value iteration or dynamic programming to find the optimal Q-values for each state-action pair. However, since I'm supposed to propose a policy without knowing the exact hole positions, I'll have to make educated guesses based on typical FrozenLake setups, where holes are usually in states like 5, 6, 7, etc.

Looking at the previous policies, they seem to be trying different combinations but not consistently getting high rewards. Maybe the problem is that certain actions from specific states lead to holes more often than others. So I need to adjust the policy to avoid those.

For example, if from state 0 (top-left), taking action 1 leads to a higher chance of falling into a hole, then I should choose an action that has a better success rate in reaching the goal without risk. Similarly, for other states, I'll have to determine which actions are safer and more effective.

I also notice that some policies try to move right or down repeatedly, which might not be the best strategy because of the slippery nature. Instead, a combination of moves that increases the likelihood of moving towards the goal while avoiding dangerous areas would be better.

Since this is an iterative process, I should propose a policy that explores new territories but also hones in on promising paths once high rewards are observed. Given that the current best reward is around 0.3, which is still low, I might need to suggest policies that take more direct routes towards the goal or adjust actions in states where progress was previously hindered.

One thing I'm considering is setting up a policy where from each state, the agent has a higher probability of moving towards the right or down, as those directions generally lead closer to the goal. For instance, from state 0, choosing action 2 (up) might not be useful since it's already at the top; instead, actions that move right or down would be better.

But I also have to remember that each action leads to three possible moves with equal chance. So, for each action chosen, there's a risk of moving in an unintended direction. Therefore, the policy should choose actions that maximize the probability of reaching the goal while minimizing the chance of hitting a hole.

Given all this, I'll propose a new set of parameters where from each state, the agent chooses the action that has the highest potential to move towards the goal, considering the slippery nature and avoiding known or inferred holes.
