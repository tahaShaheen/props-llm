You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to solve this FrozenLake environment problem where the goal is to find the globally optimal policy that gives a reward around 1.0. The environment is a 4x4 grid with some holes and it's slippery, meaning actions have stochastic outcomes. My task is to propose a new set of parameters (params) each iteration, following specific rules.

First, I need to understand the problem setup. The agent moves on a grid where each state corresponds to a cell in the grid. Actions are taken stochastically—when you choose an action, the agent can move in three directions with equal probability. The goal is state 15 (bottom-right corner), which gives +1 reward, while all other states give 0 except for holes that end the episode.

The policy is a function mapping each state to one of four actions. The params array has 16 elements, each from [0,1,2,3]. My job is to propose these params in each iteration, trying to maximize the reward.

Looking at the history provided, all previous top-performing policies have low rewards (around 0.05). This suggests that none of them are getting close to the goal consistently or avoiding holes effectively. So, I'm likely in an exploration phase where I need to try different strategies to find a path to the goal without falling into holes.

The recent params tried are also yielding low rewards, so I should consider exploring new configurations rather than tweaking existing ones. My aim is to maximize information gain by testing new policies that might provide insights into better paths or hole locations.

I remember that in such grid worlds, the optimal policy often involves moving towards the goal while avoiding holes. Since the environment is slippery, the agent needs a strategy that accounts for the stochastic movement. Perhaps setting up a policy that gradually moves right and down more, considering the possible drifts due to the slippery nature.

Looking at the state layout:
- State 0: (0,0)
- State 1: (0,1)
- ...
- State 3: (0,3)
- State 4: (1,0)
- ...
- State 7: (1,3)
- And so on until state 15.

To reach the goal (state 15), the agent needs to move right and down. But due to slippiness, choosing actions that have a mix of directions might help in navigating towards the goal despite stochasticity.

I should consider setting up the policy such that states closer to the goal prioritize moving towards it while avoiding known holes. However, since I don't know where the holes are, the policy needs to be cautious.

One approach is to design the policy so that the agent tends to move right and down more often, even though each action only gives a 1/3 chance of moving in any direction. Alternatively, perhaps setting up actions that create a drift towards the goal despite the randomness.

Let me try constructing a params array where states closer to the bottom-right have actions that are likely to push them towards state 15.

For example:
- In state 0 (top-left), action 3 (which allows moving left, up, or right) might help in exploring different directions.
Wait, no—action choices determine possible movement directions. So I need to map each state's action choice to influence the direction towards the goal.

But since actions are stochastic, it's about setting the action that has a higher chance of getting closer, considering all possible outcomes.

Alternatively, perhaps using Q-learning-like approach where each state chooses an action that maximizes expected reward, but without knowing which states are holes or the exact transitions, this is tricky.

Given that all previous policies have low rewards, I should try something significantly different. Maybe focusing on a specific path towards the goal, like always moving right and down, using the actions that facilitate those movements more often.

Wait, looking back at the environment description:

- Action 0: can move down, left, up.
- Action 1: can move right, down, left.
- Action 2: can move up, right, down.
- Action 3: can move left, up, right.

So each action excludes one direction. For example, action 0 cannot move right, action 1 cannot move up, etc.

If the goal is to reach state 15 (right bottom), then moving right and down are the primary directions needed. So I should choose actions that allow movement towards these directions more often.

For example, in a state near the top-left, choosing actions that can eventually lead towards the right or down would be better.

Looking at each action's possible movements:

- Action 0: allows down, left, up. Not helpful for moving right.
- Action 1: allows right, down, left. Good for moving right and down.
- Action 2: allows up, right, down. Also good for right and down.
- Action 3: allows left, up, right. Can move right but not directly down.

So actions 1 and 2 are more suitable for states that need to move towards the goal.

Perhaps setting all states (except those near edges) to choose between action 1 or 2, which have higher chances of moving right or down.

But I also need to avoid falling into holes. Since I don't know where the holes are, I have to make a policy that either avoids them by default or finds a path that's less risky.

Given that all previous policies are performing poorly, perhaps the holes are in certain states, and the optimal path requires careful navigation around them. Alternatively, maybe the hole positions are such that a direct path isn't possible, requiring a more meandering approach.

But without knowing the hole positions, it's challenging to create an exact policy. So I should aim for a general strategy that moves towards the goal while being cautious of potential dead-ends.

I could try setting up a policy where states in the top row and leftmost column choose actions that encourage moving down or right, while other states might have more varied actions. For example:

- States 0 to 3 (top row): choose action 1 (can move right, down, left). This allows them to either stay in place, move down, or move right.
- Similarly, for other states.

But perhaps a better approach is to define the policy based on the grid's structure, setting each state's action to one that tends towards the goal. For instance:

Looking at each state and determining which action would best help it move towards 15, considering all possible next steps.

Alternatively, I could model this as a graph where each node has transitions based on actions, and then find an optimal path.

But without knowing the hole locations, this is difficult. So perhaps the best approach is to propose a policy that tries to move right and down as much as possible, using actions 1 and 2 for most states.

Let me try constructing such a params array:

- For each state i (0-15), set params[i] to either 1 or 2, depending on their position.

For example:
- States in the top row (0-3) and left column (4,8,12): action 1 allows moving down or right.
- Middle states: action 2 allows up, right, down—good for moving towards the goal.
- For states closer to the goal, perhaps a different action is better.

Alternatively, I could set all states to choose action 3 (which allows left, up, right) but that might not be optimal as it doesn't include down.

Wait, action 1 includes down, which is important for moving towards the bottom.

Perhaps, for most states, choosing between actions 1 and 2. Let me define:

- For states in even-numbered columns (0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14), choose action 1.
- For odd-numbered columns, choose action 2.

But I'm not sure if that's the best approach.

Alternatively, perhaps using a deterministic policy that moves towards the goal as much as possible. However, due to slippiness, it's better to have actions that increase the probability of moving in the desired direction.

Another idea is to use a greedy approach where each state's action is chosen based on what would lead closer to the goal on average.

But without knowing the hole positions, I can't accurately compute this. So perhaps trying a policy where most states choose action 1 or 2, which include right and down movements.

Let me try setting all states except those near the top-left to choose action 2, and the top-left states to choose action 1.

Alternatively, perhaps using a spiral approach from the start to the goal, but I'm not sure how that would translate into params.

Wait, looking back at the previous attempts:

In one of the policies, params[0] was 3 (action 3), which allows moving left, up, or right. But since state 0 is (0,0), moving left or up would take it out of bounds? Or does the environment wrap around?

Wait, in FrozenLake environments, typically moving beyond the grid doesn't change the state—agents stay in place. So in state 0, moving left stays in state 0.

But holes are certain states where stepping on them ends the episode. So I need a policy that avoids those states as much as possible.

Given that all previous policies have low rewards, perhaps they are either falling into holes or not reaching the goal efficiently.

I think a good starting point is to set up a policy that tries to move right and down as much as possible, using actions 1 and 2 for most states.

Let me construct such a params array:

- For all states except those in specific positions, choose action 1 (which allows moving right, down, left). This way, there's a chance to move towards the goal.
- Alternatively, maybe set some states to action 3 if that helps avoid certain holes.

But without knowing where the holes are, this is tricky. So perhaps I need to propose a policy that tries to move towards the goal while leaving flexibility for exploration.

Another thought: in the first few iterations, since no policies have high rewards, it's likely that either the hole positions are such that most paths lead to them or the optimal path requires precise action choices.

Given that, maybe trying a policy where each state's action is chosen to move towards the goal as much as possible. For example:

- States in even-numbered rows choose action 1 (right/down/left)
- States in odd-numbered rows choose action 2 (up/right/down)

This would create a mix of movements that could navigate the agent towards the goal.

Alternatively, perhaps setting all states to choose action 3 (left/up/right), which allows right movement and might help in some cases.

But I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to try a more systematic approach.

Looking at state 0: (0,0). Choosing action 1 would let it move right, down, or left. Since moving right is towards the goal, perhaps action 1 is good here.

Similarly, for state 1: (0,1), choosing action 1 allows moving right to (0,2) or down to (1,1).

But without knowing where holes are, it's hard to say if moving in a certain direction is safe.

Alternatively, perhaps trying to create a policy that avoids staying in the same place for too long. For example, setting actions that encourage movement rather than idling.

Looking at one of the previous trajectories:

(0,3) (1,3) ... which suggests that some states might have holes. If state 3 is a hole, then choosing an action that doesn't lead there would be better.

But without knowing specific hole positions, I need to make general assumptions.

Given all this, perhaps setting up the policy such that each state chooses the action that has the highest chance of moving towards the goal, considering possible movements. For example:

- For states in even-numbered columns (0,2,4,...), choose action 1.
- For others, choose action 2.

This would allow the agent to move right and down more often.

Alternatively, perhaps setting all states except those on the bottom row to choose action 1, which allows moving down towards the goal.

But I'm not sure. Maybe a better approach is to look at the grid and try to define a path that goes from state 0 to 15, avoiding potential holes.

Assuming the holes are in certain states, perhaps the optimal policy would navigate around them by taking specific paths.

But without knowing where the holes are, it's challenging. So I should propose a policy that is robust against some hole placements and increases the chance of reaching the goal.

I think setting up a params array where most states choose action 1 or 2, which include right and down movements, would be a good start. Let me try creating such an array.

For example:

- States 0 to 3 (top row): action 1
- States 4 to 7: action 2
- States 8 to 11: action 1
- States 12 to 15: action 0 (but wait, state 15 is the goal—no need to move)

Wait, no—if the agent reaches state 15, it's done. So for states near 15, perhaps choosing actions that keep them in place or encourage stopping.

Alternatively, once the agent is at state 14 (which is one step left of 15), choosing an action that can move right to reach 15.

But again, without knowing hole positions, this is speculative.

Given all that, I'll propose a params array where each state chooses either action 1 or 2 based on its position. Let's say:

- For even-numbered states (0,2,4,...), choose action 1.
- For odd-numbered states (1,3,5,...), choose action 2.

This way, the agent has a mix of movements that could lead towards the goal while exploring different paths.

Now, let me map this into the params array:

params[0] = 1
params[1] = 2
params[2] = 1
params[3] = 2
params[4] = 1
params[5] = 2
params[6] = 1
params[7] = 2
params[8] = 1
params[9] = 2
params[10] = 1
params[11] = 2
params[12] = 1
params[13] = 2
params[14] = 1
params[15] = 2

Wait, but state 15 is the goal. Choosing action 2 (which can move up, right, down) might not be optimal because once you're at 15, you should stop. But according to the problem statement, stepping onto 15 gives +1 reward and ends the episode. So perhaps setting params[15] = 3 or something else isn't necessary because it's already the goal.

But I'm not sure if the agent can take actions after reaching the goal—probably not, as the episode ends upon reaching state 15.

So for states leading to 15, I should set their actions such that there's a high chance of moving into 15. For example, state 14 (which is (3,2)) can choose action 0 (down), which would take it to 15 with some probability.

Wait, let me think about the grid:

Each state corresponds to row and column as follows:

State = 4 * row + column.

So for state i:
row = i // 4
column = i % 4

Thus, state 0: (0,0), 1:(0,1), ..., 3:(0,3)
state 4: (1,0), ..., 7:(1,3)
state 8: (2,0), ..., 11:(2,3)
state 12: (3,0), ..., 15:(3,3)

So to reach state 15 from state 14 (which is (3,2)), moving right would take it to state 15. So for state 14, action that includes moving right would be better.

Looking at the actions:

- Action 0: down, left, up
- Action 1: right, down, left
- Action 2: up, right, down
- Action 3: left, up, right

So for state 14 (which is (3,2)), to move right to 15, the agent needs an action that includes moving right. Actions 1, 2, and 3 include right.

Thus, setting params[14] = 1,2, or 3 would allow a chance to move right into state 15.

Similarly, for other states near the goal:

State 13: (3,1). To reach 15, needs to move right twice or down once and then right. So choosing actions that include moving right and down.

But without knowing holes, it's hard to set exact values.

Given all this, perhaps setting up a params array where each state chooses action 2. Let me try that:

params[i] = 2 for all i from 0 to 15.

This way, every state has a chance to move up, right, or down. For states near the top, moving down would help; for those on the left, moving right would help.

But I'm not sure if this is optimal. Maybe in some cases, other actions are better.

Alternatively, perhaps using action 3 for certain states to increase right movement.

Another thought: since the environment is slippery, perhaps a cautious approach is needed where each state's action leads towards the goal but also has some flexibility.

Given that all previous policies have low rewards, I should try something different. Maybe setting up a policy where certain key states have specific actions to navigate around possible holes.

But without knowing hole positions, it's challenging. So perhaps the best approach is to create a general-purpose policy that encourages movement towards the goal and allows for exploration.

In conclusion, I'll propose a params array where each state chooses action 2 (which includes right and down movements). This should give the agent a good chance of moving towards the goal while allowing some flexibility.
