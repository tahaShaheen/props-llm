You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 599 out of 5000. OUTPUT ONLY THIS SINGLE LINE:

Do NOT output anything else. No explanation, no reasoning, nothing.



LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) and get a reward of +1. All other states give 0, except if you fall into a hole, which ends the episode.

First, I need to understand how the movement works because the environment is slippery. Each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability. For example, moving left (action 0) could result in down, left, or up. So, from any state, each action has multiple outcomes.

The policy is a fixed array of 16 actions, one for each state. The challenge is to choose these actions such that the agent maximizes its chances of reaching the goal without falling into any holes.

Looking at the previous attempts and trajectories provided, I notice that many policies are leading to low rewards (around 0.2-0.3) and some even get stuck or fall into holes. The top-performing policies aren't doing great either, so there's room for improvement.

I think a good strategy is to ensure that from each state, the agent has a high probability of moving towards the goal without stepping on holes. Since actions are probabilistic, the policy should guide the agent along paths that have higher chances of success.

For instance, states closer to the goal (like 12-15) should ideally move right or down if possible, while states near the top-left should move towards increasing row and column indices.

I'll start by mapping out which actions would lead towards the goal from each state. For example:
- State 0 (top-left): Moving down is essential to avoid staying in a position where it's harder to reach the goal.
- States along the top row: Moving right or down, depending on proximity to the goal.
- Similarly, for other rows and columns.

I also need to consider avoiding holes. From previous trajectories, some states might have led to holes when certain actions were taken. So, I should choose actions that minimize the chance of falling into these holes.

After considering all this, I'll propose a policy where each state's action is chosen to move towards the goal as much as possible while avoiding risky moves that could lead to holes.
