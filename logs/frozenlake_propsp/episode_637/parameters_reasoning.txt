You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best possible policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward by reaching state 15, which gives +1, while avoiding holes that end the episode.

From the problem description, I know that each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability due to the slippery nature of the grid. So, even if the agent chooses a specific action, it might not end up where it intended because there's randomness involved.

Looking at the trajectories provided, I can see some patterns. For example, one trajectory went (0,1) → (4,2) → (8,2). That suggests that from state 0, taking action 1 led to state 4. But since the grid is slippery, maybe there's a hole somewhere along these paths.

The top-performing policies have average rewards around 0.30 or lower, which means they're not yet reaching the goal consistently. The best reward so far is 0.30, but we need to get closer to 1.0.

I notice that in the most recent trials, some policies are getting stuck or falling into holes. For instance, one trajectory got stuck moving between states without making progress towards the goal. Another went in circles and eventually fell into a hole.

Given that the optimal reward should be around 1.0, I need to find a policy that can navigate effectively while avoiding holes. Since each action has multiple possible outcomes, the policy needs to account for these probabilities.

I think a good strategy would be to have actions that generally move the agent towards the goal but also have some exploration built in. For example, prioritizing right and down movements since state 15 is at the bottom-right corner.

Looking at each state, I should assign an action that statistically has the highest chance of moving closer to the goal without stepping into a hole. Since the environment is slippery, sometimes taking a different action might be necessary to avoid getting stuck in loops or falling into holes.

I'll start by mapping out the grid and identifying which states are holes. From the trajectories, it seems like some states might be holes because agents fall into them and get stuck. Once I know where the holes are, I can adjust the policy to avoid moving towards those states.

For each state, I need to consider all possible next states based on the chosen action and the slippery nature of movement. Then, choose the action that maximizes the probability of reaching the goal while avoiding holes.

Since I'm supposed to propose a new set of params without repeating previous ones, I'll look for a configuration that's different from the top 3 but still adheres to the strategy of moving towards the goal.

I'll assign actions in such a way that each state directs the agent towards the right or down as much as possible. For example, states on the top row should move right, and those on the leftmost column should move down. This general directionality should increase the chances of reaching state 15.

But I also need to handle edge cases where moving in the intended direction might lead into a hole. So, for certain states adjacent to holes, alternative actions might be better to avoid that risk.

After considering all these factors, I'll propose a new set of params that balances goal-seeking with avoiding known problematic moves.
