You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I know that the goal is state 15, which gives a +1 reward, and all other states give 0. The agent moves on a 4x4 grid with slippery surfaces causing movements in three directions each with equal probability when an action is taken.

Looking at the top 5 best performing params, they all have f(params) around 0.35-0.45. That's significantly below the optimal reward of 1.0. This suggests that we're not yet close to solving the problem and need to explore more.

The most recent policies had lower rewards (like 0.00 and 0.10), which is worse than previous bests. So, I should focus on exploring new parameter configurations rather than exploiting what's working a bit better but still not good enough.

Since the environment has holes that end the episode if stepped on, the policy needs to avoid those. From the trajectories provided, it seems agents are sometimes falling into holes or getting stuck in loops without reaching state 15.

I should consider modifying certain states' actions to help navigate towards the goal more effectively. For example, near the edges and corners, specific actions might be better to push the agent towards the goal while avoiding holes.

Looking at state 0 (top-left corner), maybe choosing action 2 or 3 could help move right or down with some probability. But given the slipperiness, perhaps setting it to action 1 might encourage more varied movement without getting stuck.

In states near the bottom-right, like 15, the policy already seems correct as they're set to take action 3 (right), but since that's the goal, maybe no changes needed there.

I need to ensure that for each state, the chosen action reduces the risk of falling into a hole. For example, if a certain action from a state often leads to a hole, changing it might help avoid that.

Considering all these factors, I'll propose a new set of params that differ from previous ones, focusing on states near the top and left edges, encouraging movement towards the right and down directions while allowing for variation to avoid holes.
