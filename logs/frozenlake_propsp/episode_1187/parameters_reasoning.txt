You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward by reaching state 15 without falling into any holes. From what I understand, each state corresponds to a position in the grid, and taking an action can lead to three possible directions with equal probability due to the slippery nature of the environment.

First, I need to map out all the states from 0 to 15. The top row is 0-3, then 4-7, 8-11, and finally 12-15 at the bottom. The agent starts somewhere on this grid, and the goal is state 15.

The policy is an array of 16 values, each indicating which action (0-3) to take from that state. So, I need to determine the optimal action for each state to maximize the chance of reaching 15 while avoiding holes.

Looking at the trajectories provided, it seems like many policies are getting stuck or falling into loops without reaching the goal. The best reward so far is around 0.45, which isn't very high, indicating that the current strategies aren't efficient enough.

Since the environment is slippery, the agent's chosen action doesn't always lead directly to the intended state. For example, choosing action 0 might move it down, left, or up with equal probability. Therefore, the policy needs to account for this uncertainty and choose actions that statistically increase the chances of moving towards the goal.

I should focus on creating a policy that navigates the agent towards the bottom-right corner (state 15). That probably means prioritizing right and down movements since those would lead closer to the goal. However, because of the slippery nature, I can't rely solely on direct paths; I need to consider all possible outcomes.

Looking at the recent policies provided, many seem to have actions that might be leading towards holes or not effectively progressing towards the goal. For instance, some trajectories show the agent moving in circles or getting stuck near the top-left without making progress.

To improve this, maybe I should adjust certain states' actions to push the agent more directly towards the goal, considering the possible movement probabilities. For example, from state 0 (top-left), choosing an action that has a higher chance of moving right or down would be beneficial. But since each action leads to three possibilities, it's about selecting the action that statistically gives the best path.

I also notice that some policies have multiple states set to action 1 or 3, which might be causing the agent to move left or up, counterproductive directions. Perhaps reducing these and increasing right (action 2) and down (action 0) actions would help.

Let me try to outline a basic strategy:

- For states near the top-left (0-3), prioritize moving right or down.
- For middle states, choose actions that move towards the bottom-right.
- Avoid actions that could lead into known holes. However, without knowing exactly where the holes are, I have to infer based on previous trajectories.

From the provided top 5 policies, they seem to be getting a reward around 0.35-0.45, which is lower than the target of 1.0. So there's room for improvement.

Perhaps I should create a policy where each state's action pushes the agent closer to the goal on average. For example, from state 0 (top-left), choosing action 2 (right) would increase the chance to move towards the right. From state 4 (next row down from 0), perhaps action 3 (which could move up, right, or down) might help in moving right or further down.

Wait, but each action has three possible directions. So, choosing action 2 (right, up, down) for state 0 would mean a 1/3 chance to go right, which is helpful. Alternatively, action 0 (down, left, up) would have a chance to move down towards the goal.

Hmm, maybe it's better to choose actions that have a higher probability of moving towards the goal direction. For example, in state 0, choosing action 2 (right) gives a 1/3 chance to go right and 1/3 each to up or down. Alternatively, action 0 would move down with 1/3, which is also helpful.

I think I need to map out all possible actions and their probabilities for each state to determine the best path statistically. But since this is complex, maybe a greedy approach based on Manhattan distance towards the goal (state 15) would work.

Calculating the optimal action per state based on minimizing distance to the goal considering the movement probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps using Q-learning or value iteration could help, but since I'm supposed to propose parameters without that, I'll try to reason it out.

Let me consider each state and decide which action is best:

- State 0: top-left. Moving right (action 2) might take it towards state 1, which is better than moving up or down.
- State 1: top-middle. Maybe move right (action 2 again) to go towards state 2.
- Continue this way until the end.

Wait, but due to the slippery nature, sometimes moving in one direction could lead to other states, so it's not straightforward. For example, from state 0, choosing action 0 might take it down to state 4 with probability 1/3, which is also a good move towards the goal.

So perhaps a combination of actions that have both right and down probabilities would be best for initial states.

Looking at the previous top policies, many had params[0] set to 1 or 2. Action 1 from state 0 can lead to moving right, down, or left. Left is bad because it goes back to state 0, so maybe avoiding action 1 in state 0 would be better.

Alternatively, perhaps setting state 0's action to 0 (down) could move towards state 4, which might be a better path.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for patterns in the previous policies that performed well and see what they have in common. For example, the first top policy had params[0] as 1, which led to some progress but not enough.

Another approach is to ensure that from each state, the action chosen statistically moves towards the goal without getting stuck or falling into holes.

Perhaps I should set actions for states near the bottom-right (like 12-15) to move right or down if possible, since they are already close. For other states, choose actions that have a higher chance of moving towards those regions.

Wait, but state 15 is the goal, so once there, we're done. So from state 14 (which is just above 15), choosing action 2 (right) would take it to 15 with some probability.

Similarly, from state 10, which is in the third row, middle column, moving down would get closer to the goal.

This is getting a bit too vague. Maybe I should propose a policy that tends to move right and down more often, avoiding left and up unless necessary.

Given all this, perhaps setting most states' actions to 0 (down) or 2 (right), depending on their position, would be optimal.
