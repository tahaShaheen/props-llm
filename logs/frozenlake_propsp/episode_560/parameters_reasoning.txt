You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right corner) while avoiding holes. The agent can move in four directions, but due to the slippery nature of the grid, each action leads to one of three possible moves with equal probability.

First, I need to understand the structure of the grid. It's a 4x4 grid where states are numbered from 0 to 15. The top row is 0-3, next is 4-7, then 8-11, and finally 12-15 at the bottom. State 15 is the goal, and some other states are holes that end the episode.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 elements (params), where each element corresponds to a state and determines which action to take when in that state. The actions can be 0, 1, 2, or 3. My task is to propose these params such that the agent maximizes its reward, which is +1 upon reaching state 15.

Looking at the provided examples, I see that the best-performing policies so far have average rewards around 0.30. The optimal should be around 1.0, so there's room for improvement.

I remember that in the standard FrozenLake problem without slipping, a policy that always moves right or down when possible is optimal. But here, because of the slipperiness, the agent's actions are stochastic. So, I need to design a policy that increases the probability of reaching state 15 while avoiding holes.

One approach is to make sure that from each state, the chosen action leads towards the goal with as much probability as possible. For example, states closer to the bottom-right should have actions that move right or down, but considering the slippery nature, I need to pick actions that have a higher chance of moving in the desired direction.

Looking at the grid:

- From state 0 (top-left), moving right is better than down because it leads towards the goal. However, due to slipping, choosing an action that has right as one of its possible moves would be good.
- Similarly, for other states, I should choose actions that have a higher chance of moving closer to state 15.

But since each action can lead to three directions, I need to map each state's params[i] to an action that gives the best chance. For instance:

- From state 0 (top-left), possible actions are right, down, left for action 1. So choosing action 1 would allow movement towards right or down.
Wait, no—looking back at the problem statement: when the agent takes action 0, it can move down, left, or up. Action 1 allows moving right, down, or left. So each action has three possible moves.

So for state 0, to move right (towards goal), we need to take action 1 because that includes right as one of the options.

Similarly, in other states:

- State 3 is at top-right. From here, moving down would be better. But looking at actions: taking action 1 from state 3 allows moves to right, down, or left. If we take action 0 (down, left, up), that might not help.

Wait, actually, each action's possible directions are fixed regardless of the state. So I need to find for each state which action gives the best chance to move towards the goal when considering the possible next states.

For example:

- From state 0: actions can be down (to state 4), left (but that would go out of bounds, so it's a hole?), or up (which is impossible as you're already at top). Wait, no—maybe in this setup, moving left from state 0 might lead to a hole. Similarly for other edges.

I need to consider which states are holes. The problem says there are some holes but doesn't specify their locations. So I have to infer based on the trajectories provided.

Looking at the trajectories:

- One trajectory was (0,1) → (4,2) → (8,2). So from state 0, action 1 leads to state 4, which is down.
Wait, that seems contradictory because if action 1 allows moving right, down, or left. From state 0 (which is top-left), moving right would be to state 1, down to state 4, and left might be a hole.

Similarly, another trajectory was (0,3) leading to (1,3), but I'm not sure if that's a hole.

Given the example where params[0] was set to 2, which from action definitions would allow moving up, right, or down. From state 0, moving up is impossible, so it could move right or down.

But without knowing the exact holes, perhaps the best approach is to design a policy that avoids staying in the same place and moves towards the goal as much as possible.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look for patterns in the previous params that performed well. The top-performing one had:

params[0]:2; ... which for state 0, action 2 would allow moving up, right, or down. Since from state 0, moving up isn't possible, but moving right (to state 1) or down (state 4) are both towards the goal.

Wait, but in that case, maybe setting params[0] to 2 is better because it allows a chance to move right towards the goal.

Similarly, for other states:

- State 1: from here, moving right would take to state 2, down to state 5. So choosing an action that has right or down as options.

But considering the slipperiness, maybe choosing actions that have multiple paths towards the goal is better.

Given that the previous top params had high rewards around 0.30, which is lower than optimal, I need to find a policy that can reach state 15 more frequently.

Perhaps setting up a policy where from each state, the agent has a higher chance of moving towards the goal by selecting actions that cover multiple paths.

For example:

- From states near the top and left, encourage moving down or right.
- From states near the bottom or right, encourage moving right or down as needed to reach state 15.

But without knowing the exact holes, I have to make educated guesses.

Looking at the recent params provided, one had all params set to 3 except some. The trajectory for that was (0,3) → (1,3) etc., which might not be optimal because moving right from state 0 would take it to state 1, but in this case, action 3 leads to right, up, or left.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on states near the goal. For example, state 14 is one step away from 15. So for state 14, the optimal action would be any that can move right (to 15). But in this setup, each action has a 1/3 chance to go in three directions.

Wait no—the states have specific connections. For example, moving right from state 14 would take you to 15, but only if it's not the end of the row. Since state 14 is in the bottom row (states 12-15), moving right from 14 should lead to 15.

So for state 14, choosing an action that includes moving right would be optimal. Looking at the actions:

- Action 0: down, left, up
- Action 1: right, down, left
- Action 2: up, right, down
- Action 3: left, up, right

So for state 14, action 1 allows moving right (to 15), down (but it's already in the bottom row—maybe a hole or stays?), or left. Similarly, actions 2 and 3 also allow moving right.

Therefore, setting params[14] to any of 1, 2, or 3 would give a chance to move right to state 15. So perhaps choosing one that maximizes the chance.

But since each action from 14 has 1/3 chance to go in three directions, maybe it's better to choose an action that includes moving down as well, but I'm not sure if moving down is a hole or not.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal policy for state 15 is to take any action except those leading back, but without knowing holes, it's tricky.

Given all this, perhaps a good strategy is to set up the policy so that from each state, the agent has a higher chance of moving towards the goal, considering the possible next states and avoiding holes based on previous trajectories.

Looking at the recent params:

One had params[0] = 3; params[1] = 2; etc. The trajectory for that was long but ended without reaching the goal, yielding 0 reward.

Another had params all set to 2 or 3, leading to a trajectory that reached state 8 and then 2 with some steps.

But I'm not seeing clear patterns in the trajectories provided. Maybe it's better to propose a new policy that is significantly different from previous ones to explore more areas.

In the top-performing params, many states had action 2 or 3, which allow moving right or up/down. Perhaps experimenting with setting certain states to specific actions to maximize movement towards the goal.

Alternatively, considering that the optimal reward should be around 1.0, perhaps a policy that directs the agent straight towards the goal without wandering is better.

Given all this, I think it's best to propose a new set of params where each state is set to an action that has the highest chance of moving towards the goal, avoiding actions that could lead into holes based on previous trajectories.

This configuration tries to balance movement towards the goal while considering possible slippery outcomes.
