You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy parameters for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward by reaching state 15, avoiding holes along the way. The environment is slippery, meaning each action leads to a random direction with equal probability.

First, I need to understand the grid setup. It's a 4x4 grid where states are numbered from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). Each state has four possible actions: up, down, left, right. But because of the slipperiness, each action actually leads to three possible directions with equal chance.

The challenge is that some states are holes, which end the episode immediately if stepped on. So, the policy needs to avoid these holes while trying to reach state 15.

Looking at the top-performing parameters provided, they all have relatively low rewards (around 0.35-0.45). The goal is to get close to 1.0, which suggests that the current policies are not optimal yet.

I should consider the structure of the grid and how each state can move towards the goal while avoiding holes. From the example trajectories, some agents fall into loops or go towards holes, indicating that their policies might be leading them astray.

A good strategy would be to have a policy that moves towards the goal as much as possible while having safeguards against falling into known hole positions. For instance, states near the edges or certain middle positions might lead to holes, so actions should be chosen carefully to avoid those paths.

I'll start by mapping out safe paths from each state. From the top-left (state 0), moving right might be safer than down if that leads towards a hole. Similarly, for other starting states, I need to determine which action would give the best chance of reaching state 15 without hitting a hole.

Considering the slipperiness, each action has a 33% chance of going in any of three directions. So, the policy should choose actions that maximize the probability of eventually reaching the goal despite this randomness.

I also need to look at the recent parameters and their trajectories to see where they went wrong. For example, some agents get stuck moving left or right without making progress towards the goal, leading them into loops or holes.

To optimize, I can try adjusting certain states' actions to encourage movement towards the goal while avoiding risky moves. Maybe from state 0, choosing action 1 (right) is better than others if it helps move closer to the goal. Similarly, for other states, selecting actions that push towards the center or right side might be beneficial.

But I have to make sure these choices don't lead into holes. For instance, certain middle rows and columns might have holes, so moving up or down could be riskier than moving left or right.

Another approach is to consider what's happening in the current best parameters. The top-performing params had a reward of 0.45, which is better than others but still below 1. So perhaps tweaking certain states' actions could lead to higher rewards.

Looking at the most recent parameters, some have actions that cause the agent to take longer paths or get stuck. By changing a few key state's actions, I might be able to create a more direct path towards the goal while avoiding known dangers.

Finally, since I can't remember previous attempts, each suggestion should be unique and aimed at gathering new information about which parameters work best. So, I'll propose a set of params that adjusts some critical states' actions to encourage safer, more efficient movement towards state 15.
