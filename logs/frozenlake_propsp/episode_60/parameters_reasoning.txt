You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, let's try to figure out the best approach here. The goal is to find a global optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment described. From what I understand, it's a 4x4 grid where moving actions have some randomness because of the slippery nature. The agent can end up in one of three possible directions with equal probability when taking an action.

First, I need to identify the holes and understand which states are dangerous. Holes cause the episode to end immediately upon stepping on them, so avoiding them is crucial. However, from the information given, I don't have a clear map of where the holes are located. This makes it challenging because without knowing where the holes are, it's hard to design a policy that avoids them definitively.

Looking at the provided trajectories and rewards, all the policies suggested so far yield low rewards (around 0.10 or lower). The best-performing params only achieve about 0.10 average reward over 20 episodes, which is significantly below the target of around 1.0. This suggests that the current policies aren't efficiently navigating towards the goal state (15) without falling into holes frequently.

As an explorer in this scenario since the rewards are far from optimal, my strategy should be to propose new parameter configurations that can gather more information about the environment's dynamics, particularly focusing on avoiding holes and reaching the goal. I need to ensure that each proposed policy is distinct from previous ones to maximize information gain.

I'll consider changing actions for certain states to see how they affect trajectories. For example, maybe some states are currently taking suboptimal actions that lead towards holes or away from the goal. By adjusting these actions, we might find a path that avoids danger and reaches the target more effectively.

One approach is to look at each state and decide which action could potentially move closer to the goal while reducing the risk of falling into a hole. Since actions have multiple possible outcomes due to the slippery nature, choosing an action with high expected utility considering all possible next states might be beneficial.

Let me try modifying some key states:

- State 0 (top-left corner): Currently set to action 1 in the first example. Maybe trying a different action here could lead towards state 3 or 4, which might have better paths.
- State 1: In one of the examples, it's set to action 2. Perhaps changing this to another action could avoid certain holes.
- Mid states like 4,5,6,7 (second row) are crucial for moving towards the goal. Adjusting their actions might help in navigating better.

I'll also consider that reaching state 15 requires being in either state 11, 12, or 13 and taking the right action to move there. So, ensuring that states around these positions have actions that can lead towards the goal is important.

Given all this, I'll propose a new set of parameters where certain key states have their actions changed. For instance:

- Change params[0] from 1 to 2. This might make the agent try moving right or up instead of other directions.
- Adjust params[7], which is near the goal, to take action 3, encouraging movement towards state 15.

I'll make sure each parameter change is distinct from previous ones to explore new trajectories and gather more data on how these actions affect rewards.
