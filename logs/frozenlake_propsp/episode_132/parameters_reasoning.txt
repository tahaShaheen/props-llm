You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to propose the next set of parameters for the FrozenLake environment to maximize the episodic reward. The goal is to reach state 15 with a +1 reward while avoiding holes.

First, I need to understand the environment better. It's a 4x4 grid where each state corresponds to a specific cell. The agent can move in four directions, but due to slipperiness, each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability. Holes are present, and stepping on them ends the episode.

Looking at the provided data, all the top-performing policies have low rewards (around 0.10-0.15), indicating that the agent isn't consistently reaching the goal. The most recent attempts also show poor performance, with some trajectories getting stuck or falling into holes.

Since the global optimal reward should be around 1.0, I need to explore different policies that can navigate effectively without stepping into holes. My current knowledge is limited, so I'll aim to maximize information gain by choosing a policy that's significantly different from previous ones.

One approach is to design a policy that prioritizes moving towards the goal while avoiding risky moves. For example, states closer to state 15 (the bottom-right corner) should have actions directed towards moving right or down. However, due to slipperiness, I need to ensure that even if the agent takes unintended paths, it doesn't fall into holes.

Looking at previous policies, many have a pattern where they alternate between certain actions. Maybe I can try setting specific actions for key states. For instance, state 0 (top-left) should probably move right or down. But considering slipperiness, maybe choosing action 1 (which moves the agent towards right, left, or down) would be better.

I also need to consider hole locations. From the trajectories provided, holes are likely in positions that previous policies have led into. I'll try to identify which states are risky and adjust the policy accordingly.

For example, state 0: if the action is 1, it can go right (to state 3), down (state 4), or left (which would be a hole). So maybe setting action 1 for state 0 avoids moving left, reducing the risk of falling into a hole.

Similarly, state 3 could benefit from an action that moves towards the goal without too much risk. Action 3 allows movement right, up, or left, which might help in avoiding holes while progressing towards the target.

I'll try to create a policy where each state's action is chosen to either move directly towards the goal or minimize the chance of falling into holes. For example:

- States closer to the top-left (like 0,1,2,3) should have actions that push them towards the right or down.
- Middle states should choose actions that keep moving towards the bottom-right without stepping on holes.
- The last few states (near state 15) should prioritize moving right or down.

I'll map each state to an action that tries to move in a direction leading towards the goal, considering the possible slip directions. For example:

params[0]: 1 (action 1 allows moving right, down, or left)
params[1]: 3 (action 3 allows moving right, up, or left)
... and so on for each state.

I'll make sure that this configuration hasn't been tried before by checking against the previous params provided. Since all top params have similar low rewards, varying the actions more might help in discovering better paths.
