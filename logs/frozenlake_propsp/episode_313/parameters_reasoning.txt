You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to find the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment using a global optimizer based on the provided parameters and rewards. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right corner) with the highest possible reward. The agent can move in four directions with some randomness when it takes an action.

First, I need to understand how the policy works here. Each parameter represents a specific action: params[0] is for action 0, which means moving down or left, and so on for each state. Since each state's reward depends on its position, being in certain areas might have higher rewards (like the center) versus others.

The challenge here is that we're dealing with an unknown optimal policy because it's based on a global optimum, not just local exploration. The provided examples don't cover all possible states, so some policies are missing or only partially explored. 

To find the best policy, I should focus on exploring actions in areas where the reward difference is significant and exploit when rewards are similar. Since the goal is the right bottom grid, I need to avoid getting stuck there unless it's necessary.

Looking at the provided examples, most of them seem to cluster around certain parameters that move towards the center but sometimes have holes where they might not explore enough. For instance, some policies stick on one side or don't venture into areas with higher rewards.

I should consider increasing the exploration in regions close to the goal and ensure that when the agent is near the end, it doesn't get stuck there because of the slippery nature. Also, I need to balance exploring new paths where necessary versus exploiting known good moves.

Maybe setting params[0] (which affects action 0) higher would encourage going down from the top rows. That way, the agent can explore more in the left and up areas before moving deeper into the grid.

Another idea is to experiment with varying params for different states around the edges. For example, if I set some parameters to 1, which targets directions that avoid immediate holes, it might help in exploring safely when near boundaries where rewards are lower.

I should also think about the randomness aspect of each action selection. By increasing the chance of taking certain actions (like action 2 for up/down/left/right), I can encourage more exploration without just exploiting known good moves prematurely.

Perhaps trying to assign higher values to some parameters in the edge states and others towards the center could help. For instance, if params[0], [1], and [3] are set to 2 (avoiding immediate holes) while other actions might go for exploitation of central areas where rewards are positive.

I also notice that all the provided examples have params as integers between 0 and 3, so I need to stick within this range. Adjusting these values appropriately should guide the agent's exploration in a way that maximizes the expected reward without over-relying on local patterns.

In summary, my approach is to:

1. Focus on states where rewards are minimal or zero.
2. Explore transitions from these areas before exploiting known good moves.
3. Balance between exploring and exploiting based on immediate surrounding states' rewards.
4. Use the given parameters (0-3) strategically to encourage necessary exploration.

Now, I'll outline specific parameter adjustments that could help in moving towards the goal more effectively. For instance, increasing params[0] (action 0) when near top rows would allow the agent to explore left and up areas before diving deeper.
