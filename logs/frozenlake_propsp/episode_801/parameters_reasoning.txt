You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, let's try to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. So, from what I understand, it's a 4x4 grid where each state is represented by numbers from 0 to 15. The goal is to reach state 15 (bottom right corner) and get a reward of +1. But there are holes that end the episode if stepped on.

The agent's actions are slippery, meaning each action taken results in moving in one of three directions with equal probability. So, for example, choosing action 0 could lead to down, left, or up. This adds uncertainty because I can't be sure where the agent will end up.

Looking at the problem, we need to find a global optimal policy that maximizes the episodic reward. The user mentioned that the best reward should be around 1.0, meaning the agent consistently reaches state 15 without falling into any holes.

Now, considering the environment's layout, I think it would help to visualize it:

- State 0 is top-left (0,0)
- States 0-3 are top row
- 4-7: second row
- 8-11: third row
- 12-15: bottom row

Holes are present, but I don't know their exact positions. So the policy needs to avoid states that might be holes based on previous trajectories.

Looking at the provided top 5 best params and recent ones, it seems like certain actions are being tested. The highest reward so far is 0.45, which isn't close to 1.0 yet. This suggests that the current policies aren't consistently reaching the goal or avoiding holes effectively.

Since I'm supposed to act as a stateless optimizer, I need to focus on maximizing information gain each step. Given that the rewards are still below 1.0, I should explore more by trying different configurations rather than exploiting what's working so far.

One approach is to have policies that move towards the goal in a way that avoids risky states. For example, from state 0 (top-left), moving right or down would get closer to the goal. But because of the slippery nature, I need to choose actions that statistically increase the chance of reaching 15 without falling into holes.

Looking at the recent trajectories, some ended up in loops or fell into traps quickly. So maybe adjusting certain states' actions to be more cautious could help. For example, from state 0, perhaps action 1 (which can go right, down, or left) is better because moving right leads towards the goal and down also moves closer.

I should ensure that each state's action choice doesn't lead into a hole with high probability. Maybe certain states need to avoid specific directions if those are likely to be holes based on past trajectories. For example, in state 14 (which is just left of the goal), choosing an action that leads right would probably get to 15.

Considering all this, I'll try setting some key states' actions to push towards the goal while avoiding potential traps. Maybe for states near the edges or near the holes, more careful action selection is needed.
