You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the best policy parameters for the FrozenLake environment based on the given setup. The goal is to reach state 15 (the right bottom grid) while avoiding holes and considering all states equally otherwise. 

First, I'll consider the agent's actions when in each state. From the problem statement, action 0 leads to down, left, up with equal probability; action 1 leads to right, down, left equally; action 2 leads to up, right, down equally; and action 3 leads to left, up, right equally.

Since all states are treated equally except for the hole, I should aim to reach state 15 efficiently. The agent needs to explore areas with holes as much as possible without falling into them. 

Looking at the provided examples, the best performing params have either 0 or 3 in certain positions. For instance, when action 2 is high (params[2] = 3), it's encouraging exploring up directions more often. This might help in escaping holes.

I should also consider whether using all actions equally is better than some, but given the hole scenario, exploration seems crucial. However, since each action has certain probabilities based on their selection, I need to balance between exploitation (if an action leads to a high reward) and exploration (to avoid holes).

The best parameters seem to have 3 in positions that allow for more movement in all directions, especially up and down where there's no reward. This would give the agent more flexibility to navigate around holes.

So, I'll propose params[0] = 1, params[2] = 3, and others as needed. But wait, looking at some examples, when action 2 is high (params[2] = 3), that encourages up movement, which could help in moving around holes. Also, action 1 has higher chance for right and left, so perhaps combining these with action 0's down direction.

I think setting params[0], [1], [2], etc., to a mix of 1s and 3s would balance exploration and efficiency. For example, maybe set params[0] = 1, params[2] = 3, and params[1] = 1 as well. But I need to see which combinations work best without causing the agent to get stuck.

After considering these factors, I'll outline a possible parameter setup where action exploration is encouraged without over-relying on any single action. This should help in efficiently reaching the goal while avoiding holes.
