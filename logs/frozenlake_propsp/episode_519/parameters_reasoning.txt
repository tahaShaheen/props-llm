You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me first understand the problem.

The environment is a 4x4 grid where the agent moves around. The goal is state 15 (bottom right corner), which gives +1 reward. All other states give 0 except when hitting a hole, which ends the episode. But I don't know where exactly the holes are because they're not specified here; I have to figure them out from the trajectories.

The policy is an array of 16 actions (each state maps to one action). The agent's movement is slippery: each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability. So, if the agent chooses an action, it might not end up where intended due to this slipperiness.

Looking at the user's message, they provided some top-performing params and recent ones. From what I see, the best reward so far is 0.30, which isn't close to the theoretical maximum of 1.0. That suggests that we're still exploring and haven't found a good policy yet.

The most recent params have very low rewards (even 0), indicating that those policies aren't effective. So maybe I need to try different strategies.

Since I'm supposed to act as an optimizer now because the rewards are below 1, but considering they're quite low overall, perhaps I should be more of an explorer. But wait, no—since we've been through a few iterations and some params have moderate success (like 0.3), maybe it's time to tweak those.

Looking at the top params, one had f(params) = 0.30 with trajectory (0,1) → (4,2) → (8,2). That suggests that from state 0, taking action 1 leads to state 4 or something else, then moving further down.

Another param set achieved 0.25, but the trajectories vary—some get stuck, others reach closer to the goal.

I think a good strategy is to try policies that encourage movement towards the goal while avoiding known holes. Since the environment is slippery, the policy needs to be robust to different outcomes.

Maybe I should adjust some of the states near the edges or around potential holes to ensure they move in directions that avoid those holes and head towards the goal.

For example, state 0 (top-left corner) has action 2 (right, down, up). Maybe changing it to a more direct path. Or perhaps testing different actions for certain states to see if they can lead to better rewards.

I should also consider policies that have higher chances of reaching the goal without getting stuck in loops or falling into holes. Since the agent's movement is probabilistic, each action has three possible outcomes, so the policy must account for that uncertainty.

Looking at the recent attempts, some params led to immediate falls or minimal progress. So perhaps I need to choose actions that have a higher probability of moving towards the goal while reducing the risk of hitting holes.

I think the key is to structure the policies so that from each state, the chosen action increases the likelihood of eventually reaching the goal without stepping on a hole. Maybe focusing on states near the edges and goal area to ensure safe transitions.

Also, since some trajectories have shown progress towards the goal but then get stuck or fall into holes, I need to adjust those specific states' actions to avoid such outcomes.

In summary, my approach would be:

1. Analyze the current top-performing policies to identify patterns that lead closer to the goal.
2. Modify actions for states near potential hazards (holes) to prevent falls.
3. Ensure a path from each state towards the goal by choosing actions that statistically move the agent in the right direction despite slipperiness.

Now, I'll propose a new set of params based on these considerations, making sure not to repeat previous configurations and aiming to maximize information gain for the next iteration.
