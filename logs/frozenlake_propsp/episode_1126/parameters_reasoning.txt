You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

Do NOT output anything else. No explanation, no reasoning, nothing.



LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help optimize a policy for the FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) with the highest possible reward, avoiding holes along the way. Let me break down what I know and how I can approach this.

First, the environment is a 4x4 grid where each state represents a specific cell. Actions taken have some randomness because of the slippery nature: each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability. The policy is defined by an array of 16 numbers (params[0] to params[15]), each indicating which action to take from that state.

The challenge is to find the global optimal policy, which should yield a reward close to 1.0 if successful. Since I'm supposed to act as a stateless optimizer, I can't remember previous attempts, so I have to focus on maximizing information gain with each suggestion.

Looking at the provided examples and recent trajectories, it seems that some policies are getting stuck in loops or falling into holes. For example, one trajectory showed the agent moving repeatedly between states without making progress towards the goal. This suggests that the current policies might not be effectively navigating towards state 15 or avoiding traps.

Since I'm at iteration 1126 out of 5000, there's still plenty of room to explore different strategies. However, given that previous attempts haven't achieved the optimal reward yet, it makes sense to act as an "Explorer" by suggesting a new set of parameters that are distinct from what's been tried before.

I should consider which states are critical for reaching the goal and ensure that their actions guide the agent towards state 15 while avoiding holes. For example, states near the edges or those with limited movement options might need specific actions to navigate safely.

One possible approach is to have states closer to the goal prioritize moving right or down, depending on their position. However, due to the slippery nature, I need to account for all possible moves and ensure that at least one of them leads towards the goal without hitting a hole.

I'll also consider the trajectories provided. For instance, if an agent gets stuck in a loop like (0,2) → (1,3) repeatedly, maybe changing the action from state 1 or state 4 could break that cycle and allow progress towards the goal.

After thinking through these points, I'll propose a new set of parameters that adjusts actions for key states to encourage movement towards state 15 while avoiding holes. This might involve setting certain states to always move right or down, adjusting others to explore different paths, and ensuring that each action has a chance to lead the agent closer without falling into traps.
