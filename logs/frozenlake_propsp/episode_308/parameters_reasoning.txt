You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help optimize the policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let's see what I have here.

First, the environment is a 4x4 grid where the agent can move in four directions, but because it's slippery, each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability. The goal is state 15 (bottom right), which gives +1 reward. Other states give 0, and some are holes that end the episode.

The policy is a function mapping each state (0-15) to an action (0-3). My task is to find the optimal params array of size 16 with values from [0,1,2,3]. The challenge is to do this within 5000 iterations, and in each step, I propose a new set of params without remembering past steps. 

Looking at the provided data, the top 6 best-performing policies have average rewards around 0.25, which is significantly below the target of 1.0. This suggests that we're not yet near optimal performance. The recent attempts have even lower or zero rewards, indicating that many trajectories are ending in holes or getting stuck.

The stateless strategy means I can't track previous policies, so each suggestion must be based solely on maximizing information gain. Since the rewards are low, I'm in "Explorer" mode, meaning I should try new configurations to gather more data rather than tweaking existing ones.

Looking at the recent trajectories, many end quickly or get stuck in loops. For example, some policies cause the agent to stay in state 0 repeatedly, leading to failure. Others move towards holes or get stuck near them. To improve, the policy needs to avoid these pitfalls and find a path towards state 15.

I should design a policy that, from each state, chooses actions that have a higher chance of moving towards the goal without falling into holes. Since the environment is slippery, actions need to be robust against the stochasticity. Maybe focusing on right and down movements could help reach the goal more directly.

Let me consider some key states:

- State 0 (top-left): Should move right or down.
- States near the edges: Avoid moving out of bounds by choosing inward actions.
- States near the bottom-right corner (e.g., state 14,15): Need to ensure they can reach 15 without stepping on a hole.

Perhaps setting up the policy so that from each state, it tries to move towards increasing row and column indices. Also, considering that some moves are stochastic, choosing actions that have multiple safe options could help avoid holes.

I might propose a policy where most states default to moving right or down, depending on their position. For example:

- From the top row (0-3), prefer right unless near the edge.
- From other rows, prefer down if possible, else right.

But I also need to ensure that in slippery conditions, this doesn't lead into holes. Maybe from certain states, choosing a combination of actions could help avoid pitfalls.

After considering these factors, I'll create a new params array where each state's action is chosen to move towards the goal while minimizing the risk of falling into holes.
