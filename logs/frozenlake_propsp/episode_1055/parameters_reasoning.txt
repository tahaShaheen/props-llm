You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy parameters for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to maximize the reward by reaching state 15, which gives +1, while avoiding holes that end the episode.

First, I need to understand the environment better. It's a 4x4 grid where each cell represents a state from 0 to 15. The agent can move in four directions, but because of the slippery nature, each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability. So, if the agent chooses an action, there's a 33% chance it goes left, right, up, or down, depending on the action taken.

The holes are placed somewhere, and I need to figure out which states are holes by looking at previous trajectories where the agent fell into them. From the top 5 best-performing params, I can see that the highest reward achieved is around 0.45, but the goal is to get close to 1.0.

Looking at the recent policies and their rewards, the most recent ones are getting low rewards (0.00 and 0.10), which suggests that maybe those policies aren't effective in reaching the goal or avoiding holes. 

I need to consider how to design a policy that navigates towards state 15 while minimizing the risk of falling into holes. Since each action leads to three possible moves, the agent needs to choose actions that have a higher probability of moving closer to the goal without stepping on any holes.

One approach is to structure the policy so that in states near the goal, it takes actions that would likely move towards state 15. For example, if the agent is in state 14 (which is adjacent to the goal), choosing an action that has a higher chance of moving right or down could be beneficial.

But without knowing exactly where the holes are, I have to infer based on previous trajectories. From the top params, some states seem to consistently lead to lower rewards, indicating possible hole locations when those actions are taken.

I should also consider that since each action leads to three possible moves, the policy needs to account for uncertainty. So, perhaps in certain states, taking an action that has a higher probability of moving towards the goal while having minimal risk of falling into a hole is best.

Looking at the recent params with low rewards, it seems like some policies are getting stuck or falling into holes early on. Maybe adjusting the actions in key states can help improve the reward.

I think I'll focus on setting actions for the states that, when taken, have a higher chance of moving towards state 15 without stepping into known problematic areas. For example, if from state 0 (top-left), taking an action that often leads down or right might be better. Similarly, in other starting states, directing towards the goal more directly could help.

In summary, I'll propose a policy where each state's action is chosen to maximize the probability of moving closer to state 15 while avoiding actions that have led to holes based on previous trajectories.
