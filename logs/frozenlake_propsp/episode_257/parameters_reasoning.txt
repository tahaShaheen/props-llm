You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment where the agent is operating in a slippery setting. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right corner) while avoiding holes and rewarding yourself for reaching it. However, some states are dangerous (holes), which means if the agent steps on them, it might end the game unless the policy avoids them.

First, I remember that the policy is a function that maps each state to an action. Since the agent's position in state i determines which action to take, params[0] is for state 0, params[1] for state 1, and so on up to params[15]. These values are all either 0 or 3 because they can only be set from the given options.

The policy needs to explore these states without getting stuck in holes. The optimal reward function f(params) is what we're trying to maximize. Each time the agent takes an action, it transitions to a new state and receives a reward of 0 except when it reaches state 15, which gives +1. Holes end the game if stepped on, but since the policy must avoid holes, I need to find a path that goes around them.

Since the environment is slippery, all actions have equal probability. This makes exploration necessary because relying solely on deterministic paths might lead to getting stuck in dangerous areas. However, with multiple parameters (params[0] through params[15]), it's possible to create more varied policies and better adaptability.

I should consider setting each parameter to 3 or 0 based on whether the action is safe for that state. For example, if a policy for certain states should avoid holes, maybe set some actions to 3 (exploration) while others stay at 0 for efficiency. But without knowing which states are dangerous, it's tricky.

Wait, in the provided examples, parameters like params[0]:2, [1]:3... have higher rewards or different patterns. Maybe a mixture of safe and slightly safer actions can lead to better performance. Perhaps using a policy that sometimes chooses random actions (exploration) while avoiding holes when possible.

Given that the global optimal is around None, I need to explore parameters without exploiting any holes. So, perhaps starting with some deterministic policies where for each state, it takes an action towards the goal or away from holes if necessary. For example, always move right in certain areas and up or down in others could be effective.

But since it's a 4x4 grid, I can design a policy that navigates safely around the edges. Maybe prioritize actions that lead to safer paths when avoiding holes. This would require setting some parameters to 3 (exploration) while others remain low for efficiency but without risk.

I think the optimal approach is to set params[0] and params[15] to 2, which allows exploration without getting stuck in holes. For other states, perhaps set them to 0 or 3 based on whether they need more or less action when avoiding dangerous areas. This could balance the policy to explore around obstacles while efficiently reaching the goal.

So, the optimal parameters might involve setting each parameter accordingly, with some combination that avoids stepping into dangerous areas and efficiently reaches state 15.
