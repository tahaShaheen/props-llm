You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help optimize the policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me start by understanding the problem thoroughly.

The environment is a 4x4 grid where each cell represents a state (0 to 15). The agent can move in four directions: left, down, right, up. But because it's slippery, when the agent takes an action, there's a 33% chance of moving in one of three possible directions instead of the intended one.

The goal is to reach state 15 (bottom-right corner) for a reward of +1. All other states give 0, except if the agent steps into a hole, which ends the episode with no reward.

The policy is an array of 16 elements (params), each indicating the action to take from that state. The challenge is to find the global optimal policy that maximizes the average episodic reward, ideally around 1.0.

Looking at the provided data, all previous policies have resulted in very low rewards (around 0.05 or less). This suggests that none of them are consistently reaching the goal state efficiently. So, I need to explore more effective strategies.

The trajectories show that many attempts either fall into holes quickly or get stuck in loops without reaching the goal. For example, one trajectory had the agent moving from (0,3) repeatedly and eventually falling into a hole. Another stayed in (0,0), which is not productive.

I should focus on creating a policy that avoids these pitfalls. Maybe I can look at states near the edges or holes and ensure the actions lead away from dangerous areas.

Let me consider each state:

- State 15 is the goal; action doesn't matter once reached.
- Holes are present in certain cells, so actions should avoid moving into them.
- The slippery nature means that even if an action is chosen to move right, there's a chance it might go down, left, or up instead.

To maximize the chances of reaching state 15, I need to design a policy that navigates towards it while avoiding holes. Since all previous attempts have low rewards, perhaps the optimal policy hasn't been explored yet. So, as an explorer, I should propose new policies distinct from those tried before to gather more information.

Let me consider a possible path: starting at state 0 (top-left), moving right or down. From there, depending on where it ends up, continue moving towards the goal. But considering the slippery nature, maybe pushing towards the right and down is better.

I'll construct a policy where each state directs the agent towards the goal as much as possible, avoiding areas with holes. For example:

- State 0 (top-left) could move right to try to head towards the goal.
- States in the top row might push towards moving down to get closer to the bottom-right.
- Middle states should have actions that generally lead towards state 15.

I need to make sure each action chosen doesn't risk falling into a hole. For instance, if a state is adjacent to a hole, the policy should choose actions that move away from it.

After considering these factors, I'll propose a new set of params where each state's action directs the agent towards the goal while avoiding risky moves.
