You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy parameters for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward, which should ideally be around 1.0 when the agent reaches state 15. 

Looking at the top 6 performing params provided, they all have f(params) values ranging from 0.35 to 0.45. This suggests that the current best policies aren't yet reaching the goal consistently, so there's room for improvement.

The most recent two params show a drop in reward to 0.25 and even 0.00, which might indicate that some changes have led to worse performance. Maybe I should focus on tweaking parameters that are known to work well but haven't been fully optimized yet.

I notice that the top-performing policies tend to have certain actions in specific states. For example, params[0] is often 1 or 2, and params[7] seems to be crucial as it's a high-numbered state near the goal. Maybe adjusting these key states could help.

Since I'm acting as an optimizer now because the rewards aren't too close to 1.0 yet, I should slightly tweak the best parameters to see if I can push them towards better performance. Perhaps changing some actions in states that lead towards the goal or avoiding holes more effectively.

I need to ensure that the new params are unique and haven't been tried before. Looking at the previous params, I can see a pattern where certain states have specific actions. Maybe for state 12, which is near the bottom row, choosing action 0 (down) could be beneficial if it helps reach state 15. Alternatively, maybe another action would prevent falling into a hole.

I also need to consider how each action affects the possible next states due to the slippery nature of the environment. For example, in state 4 (top-left of the second row), choosing action 0 leads to moving down, left, or up with equal probability. If I set params[4] to 1 instead, it might increase the chance of moving right towards the goal.

Another thought is that some states near the edges might have limited movement options. For instance, state 3 (top-right corner) can't move up or down, so action choices should reflect that to avoid getting stuck or falling into holes.

I'm also noticing that in the recent trials, some trajectories loop endlessly, indicating that the policies are leading the agent into cycles instead of progressing towards the goal. So I need to adjust the params to break these loops and encourage movement towards state 15.

Maybe for state 8 (top-left of the third row), setting action 3 would allow more varied movements, potentially avoiding holes in adjacent states. Similarly, for state 9, choosing action 0 might push towards state 12 or state 8, depending on the slippery effect.

I should also check if certain actions are leading into known hole states. For example, in state 5 (second row, second column), if action 2 is chosen, it could lead to moving up, right, or down. If any of those directions are holes, that action might be risky. So perhaps adjusting params[5] to a different action that avoids those holes would improve the reward.

Given all this, I think the next step is to make small changes to the best-performing params from the top 6, maybe altering one or two key states' actions to see if it can push the episodic reward closer to 1.0.
