You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the globally optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to maximize the reward by reaching state 15, which gives +1, while avoiding holes that end the episode. 

Looking at the problem, it's a 4x4 grid with slippery movements, meaning each action can lead to three possible directions with equal probability. This adds a layer of uncertainty because the agent doesn't always move in the direction it intends.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 actions (each from 0-3) where each index corresponds to a state. The challenge is to figure out which actions will lead the agent towards the goal without falling into any holes, based on the trajectories provided.

From the examples given, I notice that most policies are yielding low rewards around 0.10-0.15. Since the optimal reward should be around 1.0, these policies aren't performing well. This suggests that either they're not reaching the goal often or they're falling into holes too frequently.

I need to propose a new set of params that's different from what's been tried before. To do this, I'll try to identify states near the goal and ensure that their actions guide towards state 15 without risking falls.

For example, state 14 is just one step away from the goal (state 15). So, setting params[14] to an action that can reach 15 when acted upon. Since in the environment, moving right or down might be possible actions depending on the state's position.

Looking at state 14, which is in row 3, column 2 (since it's the third row), so from state 14, moving right would take to state 15. However, due to slipperiness, the action chosen must have a chance to move right, up, or down.

Wait, let me correct: State numbering is top row 0-3, next 4-7, then 8-11, and bottom 12-15. So state 14 is the third cell in the last row (since 12 is first). From state 14, moving right would go to 15, but due to slipperiness, when action is chosen, it can also move down or up.

Wait no: State numbering is rows top to bottom. So each row has four states. So the last row is 12 (0th column), 13 (1st), 14 (2nd), 15 (3rd). So from state 14, moving right would take to 15, but when the agent takes an action, it can also move up or down. So for state 14, choosing an action that includes a high probability of moving towards 15.

Looking at how each action maps:

- Action 0: down, left, up (equally likely)
- Action 1: right, down, left
- Action 2: up, right, down
- Action 3: left, up, right

So for state 14, to maximize the chance of moving right towards 15, choosing an action that includes right as one of the options. Actions 1 and 3 include right.

But wait, action 1 from state 14 would try to move right, down, or left. But in a 4x4 grid, moving right from 14 (which is in row 3, column 2) would take it to 15 (column 3). Similarly, moving left would go back to 13, and down would be invalid since it's already on the bottom row.

Wait no: Moving down from state 14 (row 3, column 2) is impossible because it's the last row. So when action 0 is taken from state 14, moving down isn't possible; perhaps in such cases, the movement wraps around or stays? Or does the agent stay in place if trying to move beyond grid limits?

Wait, the environment description doesn't specify, so I need to assume that movements outside the grid are invalid and the agent remains in place. So from state 14 (row 3, column 2), moving down would keep it in the same state.

So for each action:

- Action 0: from state 14, can move down (stay at 14), left to 13, or up to 10.
- Action 1: right to 15, down (stay at 14), or left to 13.
- Action 2: up to 10, right to 15, down (stay).
- Action 3: left to 13, up to 10, right to 15.

So actions 1 and 2 have a chance to move to 15. Since action 1 includes moving right (which leads directly to the goal), that might be better for state 14. Similarly, action 2 also includes moving right as one of three options.

But wait, in action 1, from state 14, moving right is possible and would take it to 15 with a probability of 1/3, same as the other options. So choosing either action 1 or 2 for state 14 gives a chance to reach the goal.

Now looking at other states: For example, state 10 is in row 2, column 2 (third cell). From there, moving right would take it to 11, and then to 15 from 11 with action 3 or others. So perhaps setting params[10] to an action that can lead towards the goal.

But since we're trying to find a globally optimal policy, I need to consider all states and their actions. However, given the low rewards in previous attempts, it's possible that certain paths are leading into holes or not reaching the goal effectively.

I should look for a policy that encourages movement towards the right and down directions, as those would lead closer to the goal (state 15). But because of slipperiness, we need to choose actions that have a high probability of moving in the desired direction without risking falling into holes.

Another approach is to make sure that from each state, at least one of the possible movements leads towards the goal, and none lead into known holes. However, since we don't know where the holes are exactly (as they aren't specified), it's challenging. But based on the trajectories, certain states might have led to falls.

Looking at the most recent params:

The last proposed param had a reward of 0.05, which is better than some but still low. So maybe the agent isn't reaching the goal often enough, or it's falling into holes in certain states.

I think I need to propose a policy where as many states as possible have actions that can lead towards the goal, especially in the lower right quadrant.

Perhaps setting all states near the bottom and right sides to take actions that prioritize moving right or down. For example:

- States 12, 13, 14, 15: these are in the last row.
    - From state 12 (row 3, column 0), moving right is better, so choose action 1 (which includes right, down, left) or action 2 (up, right, down). Action 1 would allow moving right to 13, which can then move right again. So maybe action 1 for state 12.
    - State 13: in row 3, column 1. Choosing action 1 would let it move right to 14 or down (stay), or left to 12. Alternatively, action 3 allows moving right to 14, up to 9, or left to 12.
    - State 14: as discussed, actions 1 and 2 are good choices.
    - State 15 is the goal, so no action needed.

For other states:

- States in row 0 (top) might benefit from moving down towards the lower rows. So for state 0, choosing action 0 or 1 could move it to states 4, 3, etc.

But given that the environment is slippery and the agent's movement isn't guaranteed, I need to find a balance between exploring and exploiting.

Given that previous policies aren't performing well, perhaps an exploratory approach is needed. But since I'm supposed to propose params without knowing specific hole locations, it's tricky.

Alternatively, considering the best-performing params so far, they have certain patterns. For example, many of them alternate actions 1 and 3 for states in the top rows, which might help in moving right or down.

Wait, looking at one of the better params: 

params[0]:1; params[1]:3; ... ; params[15]:3

So action 1 is chosen for state 0. Let's see what that does. From state 0 (top left), taking action 1 would have a 1/3 chance to move right, down, or left.

But since the grid is slippery, this might not be the most direct path. Alternatively, maybe choosing action 2 for some states could help in moving more towards the goal.

Given all this, perhaps I'll propose a policy where each state chooses an action that has the highest probability of moving towards the goal, considering possible slips.

For example:

- For states in row 3 (last row), set actions to move right or down as much as possible.
- For states in earlier rows, set actions to move down or right.

But since the grid wraps around if it goes beyond, I have to be careful with movement options.

Alternatively, perhaps a policy where each state always tries to move right unless it's on the far right column, then move down. But due to slipperiness, this might not work as intended.

Wait, another thought: Maybe using a greedy approach where from each state, the action is chosen such that at least one of its possible moves leads towards the goal. For example, if from state i, taking an action has a chance to move right or down, then it's more likely to reach 15.

Given that, I'll propose a policy where:

- For states in row 3 (states 12, 13, 14, 15), actions are set to either 1 or 2 for the first three, and 3 for state 15.
- For other states, choose actions that can move right or down.

But I'm not entirely sure. Given the time constraints, perhaps it's better to propose a policy where each state tries to move right when possible, otherwise down, using actions 1 and 2.

Alternatively, looking at the best-performing params, they have a pattern of alternating 1 and 3 in the top rows, which might help in moving towards the goal. Maybe building on that but adjusting some states.

Wait, perhaps trying to make all states move right or down as much as possible without falling into holes.

But since I don't know where the holes are, it's difficult. However, looking at the trajectories, certain paths led to falls. For example, in one trajectory, the agent fell into a hole from state 15 (but that's the goal), so maybe state 14 or others have holes.

Alternatively, perhaps the holes are located in specific states, but since they aren't specified, I can only infer based on trajectories.

In any case, to avoid falling into holes, the policy should choose actions that don't lead to known dangerous states. But without knowing where those are, it's challenging.

Given all this, I'll propose a new set of params where each state chooses an action that maximizes the chance of moving towards the goal (right or down) while avoiding getting stuck in loops.

So here's my proposed params:

params[0]:1; 
params[1]:3; 
params[2]:1; 
params[3]:3; 
params[4]:1; 
params[5]:3; 
params[6]:1; 
params[7]:3; 
params[8]:1; 
params[9]:3; 
params[10]:2; 
params[11]:3; 
params[12]:1; 
params[13]:3; 
params[14]:2; 
params[15]:3;

Wait, but I need to ensure that from each state, the action chosen has a chance to move towards the goal. For example, state 10 is in row 2, column 2. Choosing action 2 (up, right, down) would allow moving right to 11, which can then proceed towards 15.

Alternatively, perhaps setting state 14's action to 2 instead of 3 or 1 to maximize the chance of moving right.

But I'm not sure if this is optimal. Given that previous attempts have yielded low rewards, maybe a different approach is needed. Perhaps making the agent more aggressive in moving towards the goal by choosing actions with higher probabilities of moving in desired directions.

Another idea: For states that are closer to the goal, set their actions to prioritize right or down. For example:

- States 10 (row 2, column 2), 11 (row 2, column 3): from 10, action 2 allows moving right to 11. From 11, action 3 allows moving right to 15.

So setting params[10] = 2 and params[11] =3.

Similarly, for state 9 (row 2, column 1), choosing an action that can move towards the right or down.

But without knowing the exact hole locations, it's hard to avoid them. So perhaps focusing on getting as close as possible to the goal is more important.

Given all this, I'll proceed with a policy where most states in the lower half choose actions that prioritize moving right or down, and upper states move towards the bottom.
