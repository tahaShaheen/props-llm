You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the best policy for the FrozenLake environment based on the given information. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) and avoid the holes. Let me break down what's going on here.

First, I know that the environment is a 4x4 grid with states numbered from 0 to 15. Each state corresponds to a specific position: rows represent quarters of the grid, so row 0 is 0-3, row 1 is 4-7, and so on. The agent can move in four directions, but due to the slippery nature, each action leads to one of three possible moves with equal probability.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 actions (params[0] to params[15]), where each value is 0, 1, 2, or 3. The challenge is to find the optimal set of actions that maximizes the reward, which is +1 for reaching state 15 and 0 otherwise.

Looking at the top 5 best-performing params, I see that they have f(params) around 0.35-0.45. That's significantly below 1.0, which means we're not yet close to the optimal solution. Since our goal is to maximize the reward, and these are the best so far, it indicates that there's room for improvement.

The trajectories provided show various paths taken by these policies. For example, one trajectory goes from (0,1) through several states but ends up either in a hole or reaches the goal. It seems like some of these policies are not efficiently navigating towards state 15 and might be getting stuck or falling into holes.

Given that we're at iteration 1009 out of 5000, it's mid-way, so I should consider both exploration and exploitation strategies. However, since the rewards are still below 0.5, which is far from 1.0, we might need to explore more rather than exploit what's working a bit.

Looking at the recent params, some of them have lower rewards, like 0.05 or even 0.00, suggesting that those policies didn't reach the goal and fell into holes instead. So, perhaps adjusting certain states' actions could lead to better outcomes.

I need to think about which states are critical for reaching the goal. The starting state (0) is at the top-left corner, so from there, moving right or down would be more strategic since the goal is at the bottom-right. But because of the slippery nature, choosing an action that increases the chances of moving in the desired direction without falling into holes is tricky.

For example, if I set params[0] to 2 (action up), but state 0 is already on the top row, so moving up isn't possible—it might go down instead. Alternatively, setting it to action 1 or 3 could lead to right or other directions.

I should also consider states near the goal. For instance, state 14 is adjacent to state 15. So, if I set params[14] to an action that can move right or up, depending on where it's located. Wait, no—state 14 is at (3,2), so moving right would take it to state 15, which is the goal.

Let me map out some key states:

- State 0: top-left corner.
- States along the path from 0 to 15 should be considered. For example, moving right or down each time might get closer.
- Holes are present in certain positions, so policies must avoid actions that lead into them.

I think a good strategy would involve setting up actions that guide the agent towards state 15 while minimizing the chance of falling into holes. For instance, in states near the edges, choosing actions that move towards the goal without crossing into hole states is crucial.

Maybe I should look at each state and decide which action gives the highest probability of moving closer to the goal. Since the environment is slippery, each action has a 1/3 chance of three possible moves, so the policy needs to choose an action that maximizes the chances of getting closer without hitting holes.

For example, in state 0 (top-left), choosing action 1 (right) or action 2 (up) might help. But wait, action 0 is down, which would take it to state 4, which is in the second row but same column. Maybe action 3 could also be an option.

Looking at recent params, some have low rewards because they're getting stuck or falling into holes. So perhaps adjusting certain states' actions could help avoid those pitfalls.

Another approach is to consider the structure of the grid and identify safe paths. For example, moving right from state 0 to state 1, then right again to state 2, etc., might be a safer path. But since it's slippery, sometimes it moves down or left instead.

I also notice that some policies cycle through states without making progress towards the goal. So breaking those cycles by choosing actions that push them towards the goal could help.

In summary, I need to propose a new set of params that differ from previous ones but still have a good chance of reaching the goal while avoiding holes. Since we're in the exploration phase (rewards are low), it's okay to try out different configurations as long as they haven't been tried before.
