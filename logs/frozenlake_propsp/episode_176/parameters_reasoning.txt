You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to help the user find the best policy parameters for their FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right corner) with the highest reward possible. The current approach uses a simple policy where each action has an equal chance of being taken based on specific rules.

First, I consider that using reinforcement learning techniques like Q-learning or SARSA might be effective here. These methods allow the agent to learn from the rewards it receives and update its policies accordingly. Since the environment is slippery, the agent has to explore more thoroughly because taking actions randomly can lead to staying in bad states, which result in lower rewards.

I also think about using a Q-learning approach with an epsilon-greedy strategy for exploration. This means sometimes the agent will take random actions (exploration) and sometimes follow the best-known action (exploitation). The policy parameters should be adjusted based on how often the agent explores versus exploits to find the optimal balance.

Looking at the existing parameters, they're all set to 2 or higher. This might mean that the initial exploration is already sufficient, but perhaps some actions are overrepresented, leading to suboptimal behavior. I need to evaluate if sticking with these values will yield the best results or if tweaking them could improve performance.

Considering the recent examples provided, it seems that parameters around 1-2 give good rewards in most cases. Maybe I should try values around 0 or 1 for some actions while keeping others balanced. Testing different combinations and observing which ones lead to higher rewards will help determine the optimal settings.

I also think about how to structure my testing. Starting with a range of parameters (from 0-3) and using an episodic reward function where each state gives +1 except for holes, I'll try various combinations in a systematic way. Observing which parameter set yields the highest average reward over iterations will guide me towards the best policy.

In summary, my approach is to experiment with different parameter values using reinforcement learning methods, evaluate their performance, and refine them based on observed rewards until I find the global optimal policy.
