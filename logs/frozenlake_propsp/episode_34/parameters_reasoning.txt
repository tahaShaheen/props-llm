You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm supposed to help find the global optimal policy for a modified FrozenLake environment with 4x4 grid and slippery movements. The goal is to reach state 15, which gives +1 reward, while avoiding holes that end the episode.

First, understanding the environment: It's a 4x4 grid where each move has three possible outcomes due to slipperiness. Each action (0-3) leads to three directions with equal probability. So, the agent doesn't have full control over its movement; it's more about controlling the direction that maximizes the chance of reaching the goal without falling into holes.

The policy is defined by an array params[16], where each entry from 0-3 represents the action taken in that state. The challenge is to set these actions optimally.

Looking at the feedback provided, all the top-performing policies so far have f(params) around 0.05, which is much lower than the target of 1.0. This suggests that the current policies are not successfully reaching the goal consistently, likely because they're falling into holes or getting stuck in loops.

The most recent policies tried include various combinations, but none have achieved the desired reward. For example, some policies are cycling between states without making progress towards state 15, as seen in trajectories where the agent stays in the same state multiple times.

Since we're at iteration 34 and need to explore more, I should focus on generating new parameters that haven't been tried before to gather more information about which paths lead to success or failure. This is because if all previous attempts are yielding low rewards, it's better to try entirely different strategies rather than tweaking existing ones.

I'll consider creating a policy where the agent tends to move towards the goal in each state. For example, states on the top row should aim to move right or down, depending on their position. Similarly, middle states should have actions that push them closer to state 15. However, I need to account for the slippery nature by choosing actions that cover possible safe moves.

But since the environment has holes and we don't know where they are exactly, it's better to design a policy that avoids high-risk areas. Maybe setting up actions that move towards state 15 while minimizing the chances of stepping into holes.

Wait, perhaps using a greedy approach with some exploration would help. Alternatively, considering that each action leads to three possible moves, I can choose the action that maximizes the probability of reaching the goal without hitting a hole.

But since we don't know where the holes are, maybe it's safer to have a policy that encourages movement towards state 15 while avoiding edges or areas likely to have holes. For example, states on the right side might move down, and those in the middle might prefer moving right or down.

Alternatively, perhaps setting up a policy where each state has an action that directs towards the next possible safe state, given the slipperiness. For instance, from state 0 (top-left), choosing actions that have a higher chance of moving towards the goal without hitting a hole.

I should also look at the trajectories provided to see if there's a pattern in where agents are failing or succeeding. From the recent attempts, some trajectories end quickly by falling into holes, while others get stuck cycling between states.

Maybe trying a policy where from each state, the agent has an action that points towards the goal, considering all possible slippery outcomes. For example, for state 0 (top-left), choosing actions that can move right or down, which are steps towards the goal.

Alternatively, perhaps using a more systematic approach, like trying to move in a direction that systematically covers the grid without repeating states too much. But given the slipperiness, it's tricky.

Given that all previous policies have low rewards, I'll try a completely new set of parameters. For example, setting each state to choose an action that prioritizes moving towards the goal while avoiding edges where holes might be more common.

So, perhaps for states in the top row (0-3), actions are set to move right or down, depending on their position. Similarly, middle rows would have actions that push towards the bottom-right corner.

But without knowing the hole positions, it's hard to be precise. Maybe a policy where each state has an action that tends to move towards the goal, considering all possible directions with equal probability due to slipperiness.

Alternatively, perhaps setting each state to choose the same action, like always moving right or down, but I'm not sure if that would work given the grid's size and slippery nature.

Wait, in the recent params provided, some have a mix of actions. Maybe trying a more uniform approach where each state has an action that maximizes the chance of reaching the goal without getting stuck.

Alternatively, considering that the agent might need to explore different paths due to the holes, perhaps setting up a policy that encourages movement towards the goal but also includes some exploration.

But since we're in the exploration phase (since rewards are low), I'll propose a new set of params that haven't been tried before. For example, changing several states' actions to see if they can reach the goal without falling into holes.

I think I'll go with setting each state's action to 3 for even-numbered states and 2 for odd ones, or something like that, just as a new configuration to test.
