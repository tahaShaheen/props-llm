You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 1213 out of 5000. OUTPUT ONLY THIS SINGLE LINE:
params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W
Do NOT output anything else. No explanation, no reasoning, nothing.



LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15, which gives a reward of +1, while avoiding holes. The agent's actions are slippery, meaning each action leads to one of three possible directions with equal probability.

First, I should understand how the environment works. It's a 4x4 grid where each state (0-15) corresponds to a position. The movements aren't straightforward because of the slipperiness—each action can lead to different outcomes. For example, moving left might take you down, up, or left randomly.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 elements, each indicating the action for that state. My job is to find the best possible params array to maximize the episodic reward.

Looking at the provided data, the top-performing policies have f(params) around 0.45, which is far below the target of 1.0. This suggests I'm in the "Explorer" phase since rewards are low. So, I need to propose a new set of params that's different from previous ones to gather more information.

I should consider which states are near the goal and how to navigate towards them without falling into holes. For instance, state 14 is one step away from 15 (right action), but because of slipperiness, taking right might lead elsewhere. Maybe setting state 14's action to up or down would help.

Also, states near the edges are risky. For example, state 3 (top row, third column) moving right could go into a hole if not careful. So, actions should be chosen to minimize such risks.

I'll aim for policies that move towards the goal (state 15) while avoiding dangerous areas. Maybe setting certain states to always move in directions that lead closer to 15 or avoid holes.

Considering all this, I'll create a new params array with actions that guide towards state 15 and minimize falling into holes. Each action choice should be unique from previous attempts to explore new trajectories.
