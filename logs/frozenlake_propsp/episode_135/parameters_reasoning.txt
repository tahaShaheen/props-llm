You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to help find the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment using a reinforcement learning approach. The goal is to reach state 15, which is the bottom right corner of the grid. Each state has an action associated with it that the agent should take based on certain parameters.

First, I need to understand the structure of the problem. The policy is represented by a vector of 16 elements (since there are 4x4 states). Each parameter corresponds to a state number: params[0] for state 0, params[1] for state 1, and so on up to params[15] for state 15.

The agent starts in an unknown state and explores until it reaches the goal. The policy's parameters determine which action is taken when in each state. The actions are 0 (down), 1 (right), 2 (up), and 3 (left). 

I remember that the policy is designed to explore all possible states, especially the holes in the map, by exploring trajectories. This means avoiding exploitation of known good paths but also considering other possibilities when they might lead to better results.

Looking at the examples provided, I notice that some parameters seem inconsistent or suboptimal. For instance, params[0] being 2 (up) and params[15] being 3 (left) don't follow a clear pattern, which suggests there's room for improvement in how these are set.

The user mentioned that the global optimal reward is around None; if below, we should explore. So our goal is to find parameters that maximize the expected reward across all possible paths.

Since the policy is based on given params, and each state has an action, I need to evaluate which combination of params leads to the highest cumulative rewards. This likely involves a trial-and-error approach since the optimal solution might be non-trivial.

Given that we're allowed up to 400 iterations, we can afford some time to explore different parameter combinations. However, it's important to balance exploration and exploitation. We shouldn't just stick to known good actions without considering other possibilities when they could lead to better results.

Perhaps starting with a random set of parameters would give us an initial idea, but that might not be efficient. Instead, I can use an approach where we systematically vary each parameter while keeping others fixed, evaluating the resulting policy's performance. This way, we can identify which parameters are most influential in guiding the agent towards the goal.

I should also consider whether there are any known optimal strategies for this grid. From what I recall, a common heuristic is to prefer exploring states when they're not yet visited, but since the parameter values guide the actions, we need to adjust them accordingly.

In summary, my approach will be:
1. Define all possible parameter combinations.
2. For each combination, simulate the agent's behavior using that policy.
3. Calculate the total reward for this setup across multiple episodes.
4. Track which parameters yield the highest rewards.
5. Repeat until we converge on the optimal set.

Given the complexity and potential variability in the optimal solution, I'll need to experiment with different parameter values carefully, ensuring that both exploitation (sticking to known good actions) and exploration (trying new states when possible) are balanced.
