You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to help the user find the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment. So, the user is trying to maximize the episodic reward by adjusting the policy parameters. The goal is to reach state 15, which gives a +1 reward, while avoiding holes.

First, I need to understand the environment fully. It's a 4x4 grid where each action can lead to three possible directions with equal probability due to the slippery nature. Each state has four possible actions (0-3), and the policy is determined by an array of 16 values, each corresponding to a state.

The user mentioned that the optimal reward should be around 1.0, which suggests that the agent needs to reach the goal consistently without falling into holes. From the examples provided, I can see that most policies are yielding rewards below 0.45, indicating room for improvement.

Looking at the recent parameters and their trajectories, it seems like some states aren't being handled correctly. For instance, state 12 (which is in the third row) might not have a clear path to the goal because of potential holes or slippery actions.

I should focus on ensuring that each state leads towards the goal with minimal risk of falling into holes. Since the environment is slippery, the policy needs to account for all possible movement directions and choose actions that statistically increase the chances of reaching the goal.

Perhaps I should adjust the parameters so that states closer to the goal have a higher probability of moving towards it. Also, avoiding states that are known to be holes is crucial. Maybe some states need to prioritize certain actions over others to navigate around potential dangers.

I'll try modifying the policy for states near the bottom and right sides since those are closer to the goal (state 15). Ensuring these have actions that push towards the goal might help increase the reward.

Another thought: if a state has multiple possible next states due to slipping, the policy should choose an action that maximizes the chance of moving in the desired direction. For example, if the agent is at state 8 (top-left of the third row), choosing an action that primarily moves down or right could help navigate towards the goal.

I also need to make sure that I'm not repeating previous parameter configurations. Looking back, some states have been set to specific actions, so I'll tweak those where necessary to explore new possibilities.

Considering all this, I think adjusting certain key states' actions might yield better results. For example, setting state 8 (third row, first column) to action 3 could encourage movement towards the right or up, which might help avoid holes and move closer to the goal.

I should also check if there are any states that have been causing loops or getting stuck, as seen in some trajectories. Ensuring that each action leads the agent forward without repetition is important for efficiency.

After these considerations, I'll propose a new set of parameters where key states near the bottom and right have actions aimed at moving towards the goal, while other states are adjusted to avoid holes and navigate more effectively.
