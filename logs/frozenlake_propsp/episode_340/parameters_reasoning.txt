You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. It's a 4x4 grid with some holes and slippery states. The goal is to reach state 15 (bottom right) for a reward of +1, and avoid the holes which end the episode.

From what I understand, each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability due to the slipperiness. So, for example, taking action 0 could result in moving down, left, or up. The agent's policy is defined by an array where each index corresponds to a state (0-15), and the value at that index is the action to take.

Looking at the problem, the user has provided some top-performing params and their rewards. The best reward so far is 0.25, which is still below the target of 1.0. So, we need to explore more to find a better policy.

I notice that the recent params tried include a lot of action 3s, especially in states leading towards the goal. However, the trajectories show that some policies are getting stuck or falling into holes. For example, one trajectory went from (0,1) to (4,2), then to (8,2). That might be moving down but slipping elsewhere.

I think a good strategy would be to ensure that each state's action leads towards the goal without putting the agent in danger of falling into holes. Maybe states near the edges or above holes should choose actions that move closer to the right and bottom directions.

Looking at state 0 (top-left corner), it might make sense to go right initially because moving down could lead into a hole if not careful. So, perhaps action 1 is better than others for state 0. Similarly, for states near the goal, we want actions that push towards state 15.

I'll propose a policy where each state's action is chosen to move as close as possible to the goal, considering the slippery nature. For instance, in state 14 (third row, third column), choosing right would take it to state 15 if successful. Similarly, in other states, actions that have a higher chance of moving towards the goal should be selected.

I'll also ensure that no previously seen params are suggested to maximize exploration. So, I'll create a new set where each state's action is carefully chosen based on their position relative to the goal and avoiding holes.
