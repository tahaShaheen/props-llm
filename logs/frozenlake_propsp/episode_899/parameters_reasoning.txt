You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to help the user find the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The user provided a detailed description of the problem, including the grid setup, actions, rewards, and holes. They want me to act as a global RL policy optimizer, suggesting parameter values that map each state (0-15) to an action (0-3). 

The goal is to reach state 15 for a reward of +1, with all other states giving 0. There are also holes which end the episode if stepped on. The environment is slippery, meaning actions have three possible outcomes each with equal probability.

From the user's message, they've provided some top-performing params and recent ones along with their rewards. The best reward so far is around 0.45, which is significantly below the target of 1.0, indicating that the current policies aren't very effective yet.

The user mentioned a strategy to either explore or exploit based on the current performance. Since the rewards are still low, I should focus on exploration. That means suggesting new parameter configurations that haven't been tried before to gather more information about which states might lead to holes and how to avoid them.

Looking at the top params, many have similar structures with certain states taking specific actions. For example, several have params[0] as 1 or 2. I should vary these to see different trajectories. Maybe trying a completely new set where each state's action is varied could help discover better paths.

I need to ensure that the suggested params are unique and haven't been proposed before. From the history provided, the user has tried various combinations, but none have achieved high rewards yet. So I should pick a mix of actions for each state, perhaps focusing on moving towards the goal while avoiding potential holes.

Since I can't remember previous attempts, each suggestion must be standalone. I'll generate a new set where each params[i] is chosen randomly from 0-3 but ensuring it's different enough from existing ones to maximize information gain.

For example, maybe setting some states to always move right or down, which are towards the goal, while others might move up or left to avoid holes. But I need to balance this since the environment is slippery and actions aren't guaranteed.

I'll create a new params array where each entry is chosen with consideration of possible hole positions. Perhaps for state 0 (top-left), moving right (action 1) or down (action 0). For state 15, it's already the goal, so maybe staying put isn't necessary since reaching it gives the reward.

After generating this new set, I'll output it in the required format without any explanations.
