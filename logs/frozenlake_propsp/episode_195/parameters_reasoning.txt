You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so the user is asking about how to find the global optimal policy in the FrozenLake environment using a Reinforcement Learning approach. They provided some detailed instructions and examples of parameter values leading to various rewards. 

First, I need to understand the setup. The environment has 16 states, each identified by a number from 0 to 15, arranged as a 4x4 grid. The agent can move in four directions, but with certain probabilities. Each action leads to different next states based on their probabilities.

The policy is parameterized as an array where each element corresponds to the action (0-3) for each state (0-15). The goal is to maximize the episodic reward. The user has provided examples of different parameter configurations and their corresponding rewards, indicating that some parameters lead to better performance.

The challenge here is identifying the optimal policy without prior knowledge of it. Since each parameter configuration leads to a specific reward, I can use these as data points to infer which combinations are better. 

To proceed, I should consider how to explore different parameter values systematically. One approach could be to randomly sample parameter values from [0,1,2,3] and evaluate the resulting policy's performance. Since each parameter is independent, a uniform random sampling might cover possible optimal combinations.

I need to structure my exploration such that I not only test various parameters but also track their outcomes efficiently. Using an epsilon-greedy strategy could help balance exploration and exploitation, allowing me to explore different action choices when the best policy is near the boundary of the sampled values.

Given the examples provided, some actions yield higher rewards when taken more frequently. For instance, taking action 2 (up, left, down) with probability 1 seems to lead to better results in some cases. However, other parameters might help escape local optima and find a more optimal path forward.

It's important to note that without knowing the true environment dynamics, exhaustive search is impractical. Therefore, Monte Carlo methods or reinforcement learning algorithms like Q-learning with bootstrapping could be applicable here. These methods allow for estimating the expected rewards of each action based on samples, which can then guide policy improvement.

Another consideration is whether there's a known optimal policy in this setup. From what I recall, the optimal policy often involves taking the right action when possible due to the slippery environment and holes that force exploration. However, without testing all possibilities, it's hard to confirm.

In summary, my approach will be:
1. Randomly sample parameter values from [0,1,2,3] for each state.
2. For each sampled policy, run multiple episodes to estimate the expected reward.
3. Use these estimates to guide further exploration or update the policy in an iterative manner.
4. Continue sampling until convergence on the optimal policy is achieved.

By systematically exploring parameter combinations and using statistical methods to evaluate their performance, I can identify the global optimal policy for this environment.
