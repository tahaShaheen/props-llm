You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to propose the next set of parameters for the FrozenLake environment to maximize the episodic reward. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) without falling into any holes. 

First, I remember that the environment is slippery, so each action taken has a 33% chance to go in one of three directions. This means the agent's actual movement isn't deterministic based on its chosen action. The policy needs to account for this uncertainty.

Looking at the history provided, the best performing policies have f(params) around 0.10 or lower, which is significantly below the target of 1.0. Since these rewards are far from optimal, I should adopt an exploratory approach rather than exploiting what's already been tried. 

I notice that in previous trials, several parameters were used but none achieved high rewards. For example, one policy kept taking action 3 at state 0, which might lead the agent to move left with some probability and possibly into a hole. Another policy took action 1 repeatedly, which could cause it to loop without making progress towards the goal.

To maximize information gain, I need to propose parameters that haven't been tried before. Let's consider how each state can best navigate towards the goal while avoiding holes. 

Starting with state 0 (top-left corner), possible actions are 0,1,2,3. Each action gives a 33% chance in three directions. To reach the goal, moving right or down is essential. However, since it's slippery, choosing an action that has a higher probability of moving towards the goal might help.

For state 0, if I choose action 1 (which allows movement right, down, or left), there's a chance to move right towards state 3. But considering other states, maybe action 2 is better because it includes up, right, and down, which might provide more flexibility. Alternatively, action 3 could be useful as it includes left, up, and right.

Wait, let me think again. From state 0, moving right (state 1) or down (state 4) are the primary directions towards the goal. So actions that have a higher chance of moving right or down would be beneficial. Action 1 allows for right with 33% chance, which might be good. But I also need to avoid holes.

Looking at the environment description, certain states are holes. From previous trajectories, it seems that some states are dangerous. For example, state 0 could lead to a hole if action 2 is taken because moving up from state 0 isn't possible (since it's already on the top row), but maybe I'm misunderstanding the slippery effect.

Wait, actually, the movement options when taking an action aren't based on the current position; they're fixed. So regardless of where you are, taking action 0 gives a choice between down, left, up with equal probability. But in some cases, moving up from state 0 isn't possible because it's already at the top, but maybe in this environment, it wraps around or stays put? The problem statement doesn't specify that, so I'll assume movement is attempted regardless of position and might stay in place if it can't move.

So for state 0, action 1 allows moving right (to state 1), down (state 4), or left (stay at 0). So taking action 1 from state 0 gives a chance to move towards the goal or loop. But maybe that's better than other options.

Alternatively, action 3 for state 0 would allow moving left (same as staying in 0), up (which isn't possible but perhaps stays), or right (state 1). So it might have similar chances of moving right as action 1.

But since the goal is to reach state 15, which is down and to the right, I think that from state 0, moving down towards state 4 might be more direct. However, given the slippery nature, perhaps trying a combination that allows both right and down movements could help.

Looking at previous attempts, some parameters have been tried but didn't yield high rewards. To explore new territories, maybe I should vary the actions across different states.

For instance, in state 0, choosing action 2 might allow moving up (but can't from top), right, or down. So, moving down to state 4 is possible, which could be a good path.

In state 1 (top-middle), taking action 3 would allow moving left (to 0), up, or right (state 2). Alternatively, action 1 allows moving right, down, or left. Maybe from state 1, moving right towards state 2 is better.

Continuing this way for each state, I can try to set actions that have a higher chance of moving the agent closer to the goal while avoiding known holes. But since I don't know which states are holes yet, it's tricky.

Alternatively, maybe setting all policies to action 1 except for certain key states could help. For example, in states where the agent is close to the goal, direct towards it.

Wait, considering that the maximum reward achieved so far is 0.10, which suggests that occasionally the agent reaches the goal but not consistently. To improve this, I need a policy that can navigate more efficiently and avoid holes.

Perhaps using a greedy approach where each state's action is chosen to maximize the chance of moving towards the goal while minimizing the risk of falling into holes.

But without knowing where the holes are, it's challenging. Therefore, maybe exploring different paths by varying the actions in key states could help identify safe routes.

I should also consider that some states might be dead ends or near holes, so taking certain actions from those states is risky. For example, if a state is adjacent to a hole, taking an action that has a high probability of moving into it would be bad.

Given all this, I think the next step is to propose a parameter set where each state's action encourages movement towards the goal without repeating previous configurations. Since previous policies have tried various combinations but haven't achieved high rewards, trying a completely new configuration might yield better results.

Perhaps setting most states to action 1 or 3, which allow both right and down movements, could be beneficial. Alternatively, mixing actions so that the agent has multiple pathways to explore.

After considering all this, I'll propose a new set of parameters where each state is assigned an action that maximizes the chance of moving towards the goal while avoiding potential loops.
