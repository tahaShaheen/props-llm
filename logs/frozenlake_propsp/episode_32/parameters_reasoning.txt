You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get the agent from any starting position to state 15, which gives a reward of +1, while avoiding the holes. The environment is slippery, meaning each action has a 33% chance of going in one of three directions. 

First, I need to understand the problem better. The grid is 4x4, with states numbered from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). Holes are present but their locations aren't specified, so the agent has to learn which states are holes through exploration.

The policy is a function that maps each state to an action (0-3). The challenge is to find the optimal set of actions across all 16 states. Since the environment is stochastic and has holes, the agent needs a strategy that maximizes the chance of reaching the goal without falling into any holes.

Looking at the provided data, it seems that most policies tried so far have low rewards (around 0.05), which suggests that they're either not reaching the goal often or are getting stuck in loops or falling into holes. The top-performing params don't seem to be doing much better than others, indicating that the problem is still unsolved.

Since I'm supposed to act as a stateless optimizer, my approach should focus on maximizing information gain each time. Given that the rewards are low, I might need to explore more rather than exploit current policies. But since we're at iteration 32 out of 5000, there's still plenty of time.

I think the key is to find a policy that navigates towards state 15 while avoiding known or potential holes. From the trajectories provided, it looks like some paths are getting stuck in cycles (like staying in state 0 repeatedly) or moving away from the goal.

Maybe I should design a policy that encourages movement towards the right and down directions since the goal is at the bottom-right corner. However, because of the slippery nature, each action could send the agent in any of three directions with equal probability.

Looking at previous policies, perhaps there's a pattern where certain states are not being handled well. For example, state 0 (top-left) might be getting stuck if it keeps taking actions that don't progress towards the goal. So, I should consider changing the action for state 0 to something more likely to move right or down.

I'll try to create a policy where each state is mapped to an action that generally pushes towards the goal, considering possible slippery outcomes. For instance:
- From state 0 (top-left), taking action 1 might help move right, left, or down.
- From other states, actions should be chosen to navigate closer to 15.

I'll need to make sure that each action selected doesn't lead to a hole based on previous trajectories. If certain states are known to be holes, the policy should avoid actions leading there.

After considering all this, I'll propose a new set of params where each state is assigned an action that increases the likelihood of moving towards the goal while avoiding loops and potential holes.
