You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure this out step by step. So, I'm trying to help optimize a policy for the FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right corner) with the highest possible reward, which should ideally be around 1.0. 

First, I need to understand the environment. It's a 4x4 grid where each cell can be represented by a number from 0 to 15. The agent can move in four directions: up, down, left, right. However, because the environment is slippery, each action taken results in moving in one of three possible directions with equal probability. This adds uncertainty and makes the problem more challenging.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 numbers (params[0] to params[15]), where each number corresponds to the action taken when in that state. The actions are 0, 1, 2, or 3, each mapping to different possible movements as described earlier.

Looking at the provided information, the best-performing policies so far have an average reward around 0.45, which is significantly below the target of 1.0. This suggests that there's room for improvement in the current policies. The trajectories show that agents often get stuck in loops or fall into holes without reaching the goal.

Given that I'm supposed to act as a stateless optimizer, I can't remember previous attempts, so each suggestion must be based solely on maximizing information gain. Since the rewards are still low, I should focus on exploration rather than exploitation. This means proposing new configurations that haven't been tried before to discover better reward regions.

Looking at the most recent policies, there's a lot of variation in actions, but it seems like certain states might not be optimized yet. For instance, state 15 (the goal) is always set to action 3 in some cases, which could mean trying to move right or up, but since it's already at the end, maybe staying put isn't necessary. However, the optimal action here should likely be one that doesn't risk moving into a hole.

I also notice that many policies tend to loop between certain states without making progress towards the goal. To break this cycle, I might need to adjust the actions in key states to encourage movement towards state 15 while avoiding holes.

Another consideration is how each action in a given state affects the possible next states. For example, if a state has a hole nearby, the policy should choose an action that minimizes the chance of falling into it. This might involve selecting actions that have higher probabilities of moving away from known holes or towards safe paths leading to the goal.

Given all this, I need to propose a new set of params where each state's action is chosen to either move directly towards the goal if possible or choose an action that maximizes safety and progress. Since it's difficult without knowing the exact hole locations, but based on the trajectories provided, certain states are more risky. Therefore, the policy should guide the agent away from these risks.

I'll start by adjusting some of the key states:

- For state 0 (top-left corner), perhaps action 1 or 2 could help move right or down.
- States in the top row might benefit from moving right to progress towards the goal.
- Middle states should have actions that gradually push towards the bottom-right.

I'll also consider making sure that once the agent is close to state 15, it takes actions that keep it on track without unnecessary risks. For example, in state 14 (one step left of the goal), choosing an action that moves right would be ideal if possible.

After considering these factors, I think a policy that encourages moving towards the goal while avoiding known risky areas could yield better rewards. Now, I'll structure this into specific params values.
