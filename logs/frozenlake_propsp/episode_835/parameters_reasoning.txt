You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to help optimize the policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me break down what I know and how I can approach this.

First, the environment is a 4x4 grid where each state corresponds to a number from 0 to 15. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) for a reward of +1, while avoiding holes that end the episode. The agent's movement is slippery; when it takes an action, it randomly moves in one of three directions with equal probability.

The policy is defined by an array 'params' where each element corresponds to an action (0-3) taken from the respective state. My task is to find the optimal set of actions for each state that maximizes the average reward over 20 episodes.

Looking at the provided data, I see that so far, the best policies have achieved around 0.45 reward on average. The goal is to get as close as possible to 1.0, which would mean reaching the goal consistently without falling into holes.

The most recent policies haven't performed well, some even getting zero rewards. This suggests that while there's been exploration, the exploitation phase hasn't kicked in yet because we're not near the optimal reward of 1.0. Therefore, as an explorer, I should propose new parameters distinct from previous ones to gather more information.

I need to consider which states are leading to falls and ensure the policy avoids those. For example, if certain actions from specific states often lead to holes, adjusting those actions might help.

One approach is to set up policies that guide the agent towards the goal while avoiding dangerous areas. Maybe moving right or down more often could help reach state 15 quicker. But since movement is slippery, I need to choose actions that have a higher probability of getting closer to the goal without risking falling into holes.

Looking at some previous top params, states near the bottom-right (like 12,13,14,15) are set to move right or down. That makes sense as it leads towards the goal. For other states, perhaps choosing actions that generally move towards the goal but have a safety net if they slip.

I should also consider if some states have multiple exits. For example, state 0 can go right, down, or up. But moving right is safer as it leads to the goal's direction.

Given that the previous best was around 0.45, I need to find a policy that either significantly improves this or avoids the pitfalls of the current ones. Maybe changing some key states' actions could lead to better outcomes.

I'll think about each state and decide which action is safest yet effective. For instance, in state 14 (which is one step away from 15), taking action 0 might move down, but since it's already at the bottom, it would stay or perhaps move left/right. Wait, no—state 14 is actually position (3,2), so moving right would take it to 15. So setting params[14] to 2 (action 2) which includes moving up, right, or down. But action 2 for state 14 might have a chance to move right, leading to the goal.

Similarly, state 8 is at (2,0). Moving right would take it to 9, then 10, etc., towards the goal. So setting params[8] to action 3, which allows moving up, but since it's on row 3 (indexing from top as 0), perhaps down isn't possible. Wait, the grid is 4 rows: 0 (top) to 3 (bottom). So state 8 is at row 2, column 0.

I think I need a systematic way to set each state's action towards the goal but considering the slippery movement.

Perhaps setting up a greedy policy where from each state, the agent tries to move in the direction that has the highest chance of reaching the goal. Since actions are probabilistic, it's about maximizing the probability of moving closer.

Another idea is to model this as a shortest path problem, where each state's optimal action leads towards the goal with the least steps. But considering the slippery nature, maybe choosing actions that have more paths leading to the goal.

Alternatively, since I can't plan or remember previous attempts, I need to propose parameters that will help gather the most information for future iterations. So experimenting with different actions in critical states could reveal which ones are safer or lead closer to the goal.

For example, changing the action of state 0 from 1 (as in some top params) to 2 might make it move right more often, potentially leading towards the goal faster.

I also notice that in the recent attempts, some policies end up looping or getting stuck. So maybe adjusting certain states' actions to prevent loops would help.

In summary, I'll propose a new set of parameters where each state's action is chosen to maximize the chance of moving towards the goal while avoiding holes. Since we're in the exploration phase (rewards are below 1), I need to try different configurations to find which ones work better.
