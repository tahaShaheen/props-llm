You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to find the optimal policy for a FrozenLake environment that's 4x4 with slippery ice and holes. The challenge is to maximize the episodic reward, which should ideally be around 1.0 if we reach the goal state (15). 

First, I need to understand the environment thoroughly. It's a grid world where each state can transition to three possible directions with equal probability when an action is taken. The agent needs to navigate from the start (state 0) to the goal (state 15) without falling into any holes.

Looking at the problem statement, the policy is defined by an array of 16 numbers (params), each corresponding to a state and indicating which action to take. The actions are 0, 1, 2, or 3, each with specific movement probabilities. 

The user mentioned that the global optimal reward should be around 1.0, meaning we need a policy that reliably reaches the goal without stepping into any holes. To achieve this, I should focus on designing a policy that navigates towards the goal while avoiding known dangerous states.

Looking at the examples provided, some policies have trajectories that lead to falling into holes or getting stuck in loops. For instance, a trajectory like (0,1) repeated multiple times suggests the agent is moving left from state 0, which might not be the best path. Another example shows the agent moving down and then right, but it's unclear if this leads to the goal.

To improve upon these, I should consider a policy that systematically moves towards the goal while considering the slippery nature of the environment. Since each action can send the agent in three directions with equal probability, the policy needs to account for all possible outcomes without leading into holes.

I think a good starting point is to have the agent move right or down as primary actions, depending on their position. For example, in the top row (states 0-3), moving right might be better initially. As the agent moves towards the bottom-right, they should prioritize actions that increase both the row and column indices.

However, I also need to ensure that these actions don't lead into holes. From the examples, it seems that certain states are more prone to falling into holes when taking specific actions. Therefore, the policy must choose actions that minimize this risk.

Considering the state transitions, each action from a state leads to three possible next states. To avoid holes, I should map out which actions from which states lead to safe or goal-reaching states. For example, if from state 12 (the bottom row), moving right would reach the goal (state 15), so ensuring that's part of the policy could be beneficial.

I also need to look at the recent policies and their trajectories. The most recent ones had rewards of 0.00, indicating they either fell into holes or got stuck. This suggests that previous attempts might have been too risky or not navigated correctly towards the goal.

To maximize information gain, I should propose a policy that explores new paths while avoiding previously tried actions that didn't work. For example, changing some of the earlier states' actions to encourage movement towards the right and down without immediately repeating unsuccessful patterns from past policies.

One approach is to set up the policy so that in each state, the agent has a higher chance (or at least one of the possible moves) leads directly or indirectly towards the goal. For example, from state 0, choosing action 1 might move the agent right, down, or left. If we set params[0] to 1, it gives a chance to move right, which is closer to the goal.

Similarly, for states in the top row (0-3), setting actions that encourage moving right could help navigate towards state 3 and then towards state 7, etc. For states in the leftmost column, moving down might be better to approach the bottom-right corner.

I also need to ensure that once near the goal, the agent doesn't take risky actions that could lead it into a hole. For instance, from state 14 (the one before the goal), choosing an action that has a high probability of moving right would be ideal.

In summary, I'll construct a policy where each state's action is chosen to push the agent towards the goal while considering the slippery transitions and avoiding holes. By adjusting specific states' actions based on their position and possible outcomes, we can maximize the chances of reaching the goal without falling into traps.
