You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, let's try to figure out what the best policy is for this FrozenLake environment. So, from what I understand, it's a 4x4 grid where the agent can move in four directions, but because of the slippery nature, each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability. The goal is state 15 (bottom right), and there are some holes that end the episode if stepped on.

Looking at the top 6 best performing params, most have f(params) around 0.15-0.25. That's way below the target of 1.0. So, it seems like the policies so far aren't getting close to solving the environment consistently. The trajectories show that agents are either falling into holes or not reaching the goal efficiently.

I need to design a policy that maximizes the chance of reaching state 15 without stepping on any holes. Since I can't remember previous attempts, I should focus on strategies that explore new possibilities rather than tweaking existing ones because the rewards aren't close to optimal yet.

Let's think about each state and what action would be best. For example, in state 0 (top-left), moving right or down might help reach the goal faster. But considering the slippery nature, taking actions that have a higher chance of avoiding holes is crucial.

Maybe I should assign actions that push towards the goal while having some redundancy to avoid holes. For instance, from states near the top, moving right or down could be good. From the bottom rows, perhaps moving right since the goal is on the far right.

I also notice that in previous policies, certain states like 0 and 15 are critical. If I set params[15] to 2 (up), but maybe it's better to have a different action. Wait, state 15 is the goal; once there, perhaps staying still isn't necessary since it's terminal.

Looking at some of the trajectories, agents often get stuck or fall into loops. So, I should design policies that avoid revisiting states unnecessarily. Maybe prioritize moving towards the right and down to reach the goal quickly.

I'll start by assigning actions for each state:

- For states on the top row (0-3), moving right might help move towards the goal.
- For states in the first column (0,4,8,12), moving down could be good as it's closer to the bottom where the goal is.
- Avoiding holes would require knowing their positions. Since I don't know exactly where the holes are, I need a general approach.

Wait, the user mentioned that the agent should avoid holes based on previous trajectories. So perhaps certain states lead to holes more often, and the policies have learned to avoid them by choosing safer actions.

Given that, maybe for each state, choose an action that has the highest probability of moving towards the goal while also considering what other policies have done in similar situations.

Alternatively, since I can't remember previous attempts, I need to propose a completely new set of params. Let's try making sure that from each state, the agent has a chance to move right or down to reach 15, avoiding left and up unless necessary.

For example:

- State 0: move right (action 1) since it's top-left.
- States on the second row (4-7): perhaps moving down or right.
- Continue this logic until I cover all states.

But wait, considering the slippery nature, each action has three possible moves. So choosing an action that, on average, leads towards the goal is better.

Another approach: for each state, select the action that maximizes the probability of eventually reaching 15 without hitting a hole. Since I don't know where holes are, perhaps moving in directions that generally lead towards the goal would be safer.

I'll try to assign actions as follows:

- For states near the bottom and right edges, move right or up/down to reach 15.
- For other states, prioritize moving down or right.

Let me draft this:

params[0]: action 1 (right)
params[1]: action 2 (up) but wait, maybe better to go right
Actually, let's see the movement for each action:

Action 0: moves down, left, up.
Action 1: right, down, left.
Action 2: up, right, down.
Action 3: left, up, right.

So, if I choose action 2 for state 0, it can move up (which would be invalid, staying in place?), or right or down. Hmm, maybe better to choose action 1 which allows moving right, down, or left.

Wait, but from state 0 (top-left), the possible moves are:

- Action 0: down to 4, left stays, up stays.
- Action 1: right to 1, down to 4, left stays.
- Action 2: up can't go beyond, so perhaps same as staying? Or maybe moving up isn't possible.

I think when at the edge of the grid, moving beyond would just stay in place. So for state 0:

If action is 0 (down), it goes to 4; if action 1 (right) goes to 1; action 2 might not move up.

So, perhaps from state 0, choosing action 1 allows moving right or down, which are both good directions towards the goal. So let's set params[0] = 1.

Similarly for other states, I'll choose actions that allow movement towards the bottom-right.

Let me go through each state:

State 0: move right (action 1)
States 1-3: perhaps down or right
Wait, but need to think about how slippery affects it. Maybe a mix of directions to maximize chances.

Alternatively, maybe set all states except those near the goal to move towards the bottom-right as much as possible.

But without knowing hole positions, it's tricky. However, looking at previous policies, some had high reward 0.25, so perhaps there's a way to get higher.

Wait, one of the top params had f(params) = 0.25 with trajectory (0,1) (4,2) (8,2). That means it took state 0 action 1 (right), then state 4 action 2 (up?), but in a slippery environment, that might have led to 8.

Hmm, maybe that's not the best path. Alternatively, perhaps moving down from state 4 would lead closer to the goal.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to look for a policy that others might not have tried yet.

Alternatively, try setting all states towards right and down actions.

So:

States on top row (0-3): action 1 or 2
States in other rows: action 4 or whatever moves them closer to the goal.

But since I can't remember previous attempts, I'll just make a guess. Let's set each state to choose an action that tends towards moving right and down.

For example:

params[0] = 1 (right)
params[1] = 2 (up)
Wait, but up from state 1 is invalid, so maybe better to go down or right.
Alternatively, params[1] could be 3 (left), which allows movement left, up, or right.

But moving left from state 1 would take it back to 0, which might not help. So perhaps action 1 for state 1 as well.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's try a uniform policy where each state chooses the best possible direction towards the goal without considering holes, and see if that works.

Alternatively, look at other top params. One had all even states set to certain actions. Maybe trying a different pattern.

Wait, perhaps setting all states to action 2 or 3 to maximize movement towards right and up/down.

But given time constraints, I'll propose a new policy where each state chooses an action that has a higher chance of moving towards the goal, avoiding previous params.
