You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy parameters for this FrozenLake environment using an episodic reward setup with a discount factor of 1. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right corner) and avoid entering any holes. The policy is represented by four parameters corresponding to states 0 to 15, each taking values from {0, 1, 2, 3}. 

First, I need to understand the environment dynamics better. Each action leads to three possible next states with equal probability when using a slippery agent. So, for each state and action, there are three equally likely transitions. The hole locations (other than the goal) will cause the game to end once stepped on.

The challenge is to find parameters that lead to an optimal policy without falling into any holes. Since the environment isn't fully observable beyond the states and actions, I'm supposed to exploit by using previously learned trajectories if possible.

Looking at the examples provided, some policies have action values of 0,1,2,3 corresponding to different directions. For instance, params[0] being 2 means in state 0 (top-left), choose action 2 which is up. But since the hole locations are on certain states, this might not be optimal.

I should start by hypothesizing a set of parameters and see how they perform. Maybe trying to move directly toward the goal whenever possible while avoiding holes. For example, using action 3 (left) in safe areas but ensuring we don't step into holes.

Another approach is using a deterministic policy that always moves towards the goal without falling into holes, which might be more efficient than random actions with equal probability.

I also need to consider how the parameters affect exploration versus exploitation. If too many parameters are fixed, perhaps some randomness or other strategies can guide the agent away from bad paths.

Since the current examples don't seem optimal, I should try experimenting with different parameter combinations. Maybe setting params[0] to 3 (left) in states where left leads directly to the goal, and similar for others. Also, ensuring that certain actions are avoided when holes are involved.

After some trials, perhaps choosing parameters like [2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 1, 0] which seems to move towards the goal while avoiding holes where possible. But I need to verify if this leads to higher rewards.

Alternatively, maybe starting with params as [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1], but that might not account for some transitions accurately. Testing each parameter combination in a systematic way is crucial here.
