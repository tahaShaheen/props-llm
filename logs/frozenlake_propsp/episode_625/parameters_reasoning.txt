You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with the highest possible reward of +1, while avoiding holes. Since it's a slippery environment, each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability.

Looking at the history provided, the top-performing policies have rewards around 0.20 to 0.30, which is quite low compared to the optimal goal of 1.0. This suggests that there's room for improvement in the current strategies.

The most recent policies tried include all actions set to 2 or a mix of 0 and 3, but they didn't yield high rewards. The trajectories show that many times, the agent gets stuck in loops or falls into holes quickly, indicating that the current policies aren't effectively navigating towards the goal without hitting hazards.

I notice that the best-performing params had some varied actions, like a mix of 0,1,2,3 across different states. So maybe varying the actions based on state could help explore more paths. Also, avoiding staying in the same place or moving in circles is crucial to prevent falling into holes or getting stuck.

Since the rewards are still low, I should focus on exploration rather than exploitation. That means proposing a new set of params that hasn't been tried before and can potentially lead to discovering safer paths towards state 15.

I'll create a new policy where each state chooses an action that maximizes the chance of moving right or down, which are the directions towards the goal (state 15). However, because of the slippery nature, I need to ensure that these actions don't often lead into holes. Maybe setting different actions for each state based on their position.

For example:
- In states closer to the top-left, encourage moving right or down.
- In middle states, use a mix of actions to avoid getting stuck.
- Near the goal, choose actions that can push towards it without risking falling into holes.

But since I have to represent this as specific action choices, I'll assign each state an action from 0 to 3 in a way that spreads out the exploration and avoids repeating previous policies. Maybe alternating between right and down actions across different states.

I also need to ensure that the new params are distinct from any previously seen ones, so I'll shuffle some of the action assignments to break the patterns from prior trials.
