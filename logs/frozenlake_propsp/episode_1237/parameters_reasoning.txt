You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let's start by understanding the problem. The grid is 4x4, and the goal is state 15 (bottom-right corner). There are holes that end the episode if stepped on.

The agent can move in four directions, but because of slippiness, each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability. So, for example, choosing action 0 gives a 1/3 chance to go down, left, or up. The policy is determined by an array params[0-15], each value being 0-3.

The goal is to maximize the reward, which is +1 only when reaching state 15. All other states give 0. Since it's a grid world with holes, I need to design a policy that avoids these holes while efficiently navigating towards the goal.

Looking at the problem, since each action has multiple possible outcomes due to slippiness, we need policies that can handle uncertainty. The optimal strategy should guide the agent towards state 15 as quickly as possible without falling into any holes.

From the examples given, some params have f(params) around 0.45, which is better than others but still below the target of 1.0. So, there's room for improvement. 

I remember that in deterministic policies, agents can sometimes get stuck or fall into holes because they follow a fixed path. But with stochasticity here, it's about managing the probabilities to navigate effectively.

The most recent params had low rewards (like 0.00 and 0.05), which suggests maybe those configurations aren't working well. The best ones have around 0.45, so perhaps they're on the right track but not optimal yet.

I should consider setting up a policy that, from each state, chooses actions that maximize the probability of moving towards the goal while minimizing the chance of hitting a hole. For example, in states closer to the goal, choose actions that have higher chances of moving right or down (since 15 is at the bottom-right).

Looking at the grid:
- State 0 is top-left.
- To reach 15, ideally, move right and down as much as possible.

Given the slippery nature, each action has three possibilities. So from state 0, choosing action 3 might give a chance to move up, but that's not helpful. Maybe choose actions that have more potential to go towards the goal.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to explore different policies and see which ones lead to higher rewards based on their trajectories. The top-performing params had f(params) of 0.45, which is a good start but needs improvement.

Since I'm supposed to output the params in a specific format without any explanation, I'll proceed by suggesting a new set that might improve upon previous attempts.
