You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. So, the user is working on optimizing a policy for the FrozenLake environment using a specific setup where each state has an action that's selected deterministically. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) while avoiding holes, which end the episode with zero reward.

First, I need to understand the environment fully. It's a 4x4 grid, and each cell can be represented by a number from 0 to 15. The agent starts at 0, and the goal is at 15. The actions are slippery, meaning that when an action is taken, the agent moves in one of three directions with equal probability.

Looking at the previous attempts, all the top-performing policies have resulted in an average reward around 0.15, which is quite low. The optimal policy should achieve a reward close to 1.0, so clearly these are not optimal yet.

The user mentioned that we need to propose new parameters each time without repeating any previously seen configurations. So, I need to come up with a new set of params that hasn't been tried before and could potentially lead the agent closer to the goal.

One strategy is to consider how the policy should guide the agent towards state 15 while avoiding holes. Let's think about each state and what action would be most likely to progress towards the goal, considering the slippery nature.

For example:
- In state 0 (top-left), moving right or down might be good, but since it's slippery, the agent could end up in different states.
- For state 15, we can set the action to something that keeps it there or perhaps stay still, but since reaching 15 is the goal, maybe any action would do as long as it doesn't move away.

Looking at the previous trajectories, many ended quickly by falling into holes. So, I need to ensure that the policy avoids leading the agent into these holes. Perhaps focusing on actions that direct towards the right and down, which would generally lead towards state 15, but considering the slippery nature, we have to choose actions that maximize the chance of moving in that direction.

Maybe a good approach is to set all states except those near the goal to move either right or down, depending on their position. For example, states in the top row (0-3) should try to move right towards the end of the row, and then down. Similarly, for other rows.

But considering the slippery nature, each action has a 1/3 chance of moving in three directions. So, perhaps choosing actions that have higher probability of moving towards the goal direction.

Wait, looking at the previous policies, they had a pattern where even-numbered states took certain actions and odd-numbered others. Maybe that's not effective. Perhaps varying the actions more strategically could help.

I need to think about each state individually and decide what action would best guide the agent towards 15 while avoiding holes.

For example:
- State 0: maybe move right (action 1 or 2?), but looking at the action definitions, action 0 for state 0 is [down, left, up]. Action 1 is [right, down, left], which includes moving right with probability 1/3. So perhaps choosing action 1 for state 0 to have a chance to move right.

Similarly, state 1: possible actions could be 3 (which allows movement left, up, or right). But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should create a map of the grid and determine for each cell what's the best action to take to get closer to the goal, considering all possible slippery outcomes.

Alternatively, perhaps using some heuristic like always trying to move towards the goal in the direction that has the highest chance of getting there. For example, from state 0 (row 0, column 0), moving right would take it to column 1, which is better than down or up.

But since each action leads to three possible directions, perhaps choosing actions that have a higher chance of moving towards the goal.

Another approach: think about the optimal policy for non-slippery FrozenLake and see how the slippery nature changes things. In standard FrozenLake, the optimal policy often involves moving right and down when possible.

But with slipperiness, we need to choose actions that give the highest probability of eventually reaching 15 without falling into a hole.

I think I should focus on creating a deterministic policy where each state chooses an action that has the best chance of leading towards the goal, considering the slippery transitions.

For example:
- States in the top row (0-3) might choose right or down.
- States in the leftmost column (0,4,8,12) might choose down to move towards the bottom-right.

But I need to map each state's possible actions and see which one gives the best chance of moving closer.

Alternatively, perhaps a greedy approach where each state chooses an action that maximizes the expected progress towards the goal.

Given that all previous attempts have low rewards, maybe the policy is not effectively guiding the agent towards the goal or is getting stuck in loops or falling into holes too often.

So, I need to design a new set of params where for each state, the chosen action has a higher probability of moving towards 15 and avoids holes.

Perhaps setting states near the right edge (like 3,7,11) to move down, and states near the bottom row (12-15) to stay or move right, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me try to assign actions based on this logic:

For each state i:
- If i is in the top-right corner (i=3), choose action that moves down.
- For other states, prefer moving right or down depending on their position.

Alternatively, perhaps setting all even-numbered states to move right and odd-numbered to move down, but I'm not sure if that's optimal.

Another idea: since the agent can end up in any of three directions when taking an action, maybe choose actions that have a higher probability of moving towards the goal direction. For example, for state 0 (top-left), choosing action 1 (which includes right) gives a chance to move right, which is better than other options.

So, perhaps setting state 0 to action 1, state 1 to action 3, etc., trying to cover different directions.

But without knowing the exact positions of the holes, it's tricky. The user said that we need to locate the wholes via previous trajectories, but I don't have information on where the holes are located.

Wait, in FrozenLake, typically there are some frozen states and some hole states. Maybe the holes are at certain positions like 5,6,7 or others. But since it's not specified, perhaps we need to assume they're in certain locations based on previous trajectories.

Looking at the trajectories provided:

- One trajectory was (0,1) (4,2) (8,2), which ended without falling into a hole but didn't reach 15.
- Another was (0,3) (0,3)... which suggests that moving in certain ways leads to staying in place or moving around.

Wait, the problem says we need to find holes by exploring previous trajectories. So perhaps from the given trajectories, we can infer where the agent is likely to fall into a hole.

For example, if an action led the agent into a state where it fell into a hole, that would indicate which states are holes.

But looking at the examples provided, none of the trajectories resulted in falling into a hole except for one:

Looking at the most recent params:
- One trajectory was (0,3) (0,3) (1,0) (1,0)... which implies that from state 0, taking action 3 might have led to moving down or right or up. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps in the given examples, only some of the trajectories ended with falling into a hole. For instance, the second most recent param had f(params): 0.05 and trajectory (0,0) ... which suggests that maybe it fell into a hole.

But without specific information on where the holes are, I might have to make an assumption or find a general policy that avoids likely dangerous states.

Alternatively, perhaps focusing on getting the agent to reach state 15 by creating a path towards it with minimal risk.

Given all this, perhaps setting up a deterministic policy where each state chooses an action that maximizes the chance of moving towards 15 while avoiding known or likely hole positions.

Since I don't have exact info on holes, maybe a general approach is to set each state to move in a direction that would take it closer to 15 as much as possible.

For example:
- From states in the top row (0-3), move right.
- From states in columns other than the last, move right or down depending on position.
- From the bottom row (12-15), move right if not already at 15.

But considering the slippery nature, each action has a 1/3 chance of moving in three directions. So perhaps choosing actions that have higher probability of moving towards the goal.

Alternatively, maybe assign for each state an action that gives the highest probability of eventually reaching 15.

Wait, but without knowing the hole positions, it's hard to adjust for them. Maybe I can assume that certain states are holes based on previous trajectories where the agent fell into them.

Looking at the examples, one trajectory was (0,3) (0,3)... which suggests that taking action 3 from state 0 might have led to a hole. But without knowing, it's unclear.

Perhaps, given all this uncertainty, I should propose a new set of params where each state chooses an action that would generally lead towards the goal, varying actions to explore different paths.

For example:
- Set states in the top row (0-3) to move right or down.
- States in other rows to move towards the right and bottom.

But since I can't remember previous attempts, I need to ensure this new params array is unique.

Looking at previous examples, many had a pattern like alternating actions. So maybe breaking that pattern would help.

Perhaps setting state 0 to action 1 (which allows moving right), state 1 to action 3, etc., varying the choices to explore different paths.

But without knowing which states are holes, it's challenging, so I think focusing on getting closer to the goal is key.
