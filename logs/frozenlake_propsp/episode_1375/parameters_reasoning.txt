You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy parameters for this FrozenLake environment. Let's see what information I have.

First, the environment is a 4x4 grid with slippery movements. The agent can move in four directions, but each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability. Holes are present, and stepping on them ends the episode immediately. The goal is state 15, which gives +1 reward. Other states give 0.

The policy is a function that maps each state (from 0 to 15) to an action (0-3). My job is to find the optimal set of these parameters to maximize the average episodic reward.

Looking at the top 6 best-performing params, they all have an average reward around 0.45. That's not too high, considering the maximum possible is 1.0. So there's room for improvement.

In the most recent two policies, one gave a reward of 0.30 and another 0.00. That suggests that some configurations aren't performing well. I need to explore more.

Since the goal is around 1.0, which means almost always reaching state 15, the current best isn't optimal yet. So, perhaps the policies are not effectively avoiding holes or navigating towards the goal efficiently.

I notice that in the top params, several states (like 10 and 14) have action 2, but maybe they should choose a different direction to avoid getting stuck near the hole at state 7.

Wait, I need to think about where the holes are. From the trajectories provided, it seems some states might be holes. For example, in one trajectory, stepping on state 6 leads to (1,2) and then to state 10, which might be a hole because the agent stops moving. So maybe state 7 is a hole because when the agent steps there, the episode ends.

If I can map out the holes based on the trajectories, that would help avoid them. For instance, in one trajectory, after (0,2) the next state is (4,2), which might be another part of the grid. But if an action leads to a hole, the agent stops, so the policy needs to choose actions that don't lead there.

Looking at the most recent params, some have high indices with action 3, but maybe those aren't leading towards the goal effectively. Perhaps certain states should prefer moving right or down more to reach state 15.

Also, since the environment is slippery, even if the policy chooses an optimal direction, it might not always go as intended. So the policy needs to be robust against such uncertainties.

I think I should adjust the policies for states near the goal. For example, in state 12 (bottom row, first column), maybe moving right more often would help reach the goal. But since actions are probabilistic, it's a balance between exploration and exploitation.

Maybe I can tweak some of the top-performing params by changing one or two actions to see if that improves the reward. For instance, in state 14, if action is 2, maybe changing it to 3 could help move towards the goal more directly.

I also need to ensure that the policy doesn't get stuck in loops. Looking at some trajectories, like (0,1) moving around without progress, perhaps adjusting those states' actions to break the loop would help.

In summary, I should focus on modifying a few parameters where the current best policies might be suboptimal, especially near the goal or near holes, to see if that improves the reward towards 1.0.
