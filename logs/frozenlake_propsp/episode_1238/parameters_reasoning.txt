You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the next set of parameters for the FrozenLake environment to optimize the policy and get as close to a global optimal reward of 1.0 as possible. Let's break down what I know.

First, the environment is a 4x4 grid where the agent can move in four directions: up, down, left, right. But because it's slippery, each action taken by the agent results in moving to one of three directions with equal probability. The goal is state 15 (bottom-right corner), which gives +1 reward, and all other states give 0 except for holes that end the episode.

The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers, where each number corresponds to the action taken in each state from 0 to 15. The possible actions are 0, 1, 2, or 3. The challenge is to find the optimal set of actions that maximizes the reward, especially considering the slippery nature and potential holes.

Looking at the provided data, I see that the current best policies have average rewards around 0.45, which is significantly below the target of 1.0. This suggests that we're still in an exploratory phase where we need to gather more information about the environment, particularly the locations of the holes and the most efficient paths to the goal.

In the top-performing params, I notice that many states are set to take action 3 or 2. For example, state 0 is often assigned action 1 or 2, which might be attempts to move right or up. However, given the slippery nature, these actions may not always lead directly towards the goal.

The recent policies have lower rewards, even some with 0.0, which indicates that those configurations either fell into holes frequently or got stuck in loops without reaching the goal. This suggests that the current strategies aren't consistently leading to success, so we need to try new configurations.

Since we're at iteration 1238 out of 5000, it's still early enough to explore different policies rather than exploit the best ones found so far. The goal is to maximize information gain by testing new parameter sets that haven't been tried yet and observing their performance.

I should consider setting parameters in such a way that encourages movement towards the goal while avoiding areas with holes. For example, states near the edges might have different optimal actions compared to central states. Maybe prioritizing right or down movements from certain states could help navigate closer to state 15 without falling into traps.

Let me think about each state individually:

- State 0 (top-left corner): Possible actions are 0,1,2,3. Since moving up isn't possible, maybe action 1 (right, down, left) is a good start, but given the slipperiness, perhaps another action would be better.

Wait, no—state 0's possible moves depend on the action chosen. For example, if I choose action 0 for state 0, the agent will move down, left, or up with equal probability. But since it's at the top row, moving up is not possible; instead, it might wrap around? Or does it stay in place? The problem description isn't clear on this, but perhaps movement outside the grid is treated as staying in place.

Alternatively, maybe moving down from state 0 (top-left) would take it to state 4. But if the environment wraps around or moves within bounds, I need to be careful.

Wait, no—the grid is 4x4, so each state corresponds to a position. Moving up from row 0 would wrap to row 3? Or does it stay in place? The problem says the agent can move left, down, right, or up, but when on an edge, moving beyond might not be possible. Hmm, maybe the environment is such that moving off-grid doesn't happen, and instead, the movement is within the grid.

Alternatively, perhaps the slippery effect leads to three possible moves, but only those within the grid are considered. So, for state 0 (row 0, column 0), taking action 0 would try to move down, left, or up. But since it's at row 0, moving up isn't possible—so perhaps it stays in place? Or maybe the agent can only move down or right?

Wait, no—the problem says that when you take an action, it picks from three directions with equal probability. So for example, taking action 0 (which corresponds to [down, left, up]), but if moving up isn't possible from state 0 (top-left), then perhaps the agent can only move down or left? Or does it still try all three, but some movements are impossible and might result in staying put?

This is crucial because the movement dynamics will affect how the policy should be set. Since I'm not entirely sure, maybe I need to assume that from any state, attempting an invalid direction (like moving up from row 0) just doesn't change the position or perhaps leads to a different valid move.

Given this uncertainty, perhaps it's safer to choose actions that encourage movement towards the goal (right and down) from most states. For example, setting states in the top-left quadrant to prioritize right or down movements.

Looking at the recent policies, some have been trying various combinations but haven't achieved high rewards yet. So maybe I should try a policy where each state is set to move either right or down as much as possible, given their position.

For instance:

- States in the first row (0-3) could be set to action 2 or 3, which might include moving right.
- States in the first column (0,4,8,12) could be set to action 0 or 1 for down movements.

But I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Alternatively, perhaps setting all states to action 2 would encourage more upward and rightward movement, but this might send agents off course in some cases.

Alternatively, perhaps a combination of actions per state based on their position relative to the goal could help. For example:

- From state 0 (top-left), choose an action that has a high probability of moving towards the center or directly towards the goal.
- Similarly, from other states, guide the agent in the general direction of the goal.

But without knowing where the holes are, it's tricky because some actions might lead to certain states that are holes. So the policy must avoid any action that could potentially fall into a hole.

Given that previous policies have had low rewards and sometimes zero, perhaps the current policies aren't avoiding holes effectively or aren't navigating towards the goal efficiently.

Another approach is to set all parameters to 3, which includes moving left, up, and right. This might cause more exploration but may not lead directly to the goal.

Wait, no—action 3 for a state would make the agent choose between left, up, or right. So if an agent is near the top row, choosing action 3 could lead it to move up (which might be invalid) or left/right. But without knowing hole locations, it's hard to avoid them.

Given that I need to propose a new set of params, perhaps I should vary some parameters from the previous best attempts to see if tweaking them can improve performance.

Looking at the top-performing param:

params[0]: 1; params[1]:3; ... ; f(params): 0.45

So for state 0, action 1 is chosen, which would try moving right, down, or left with equal probability. Maybe this leads to some progress but still not enough.

What if I change the action for state 0 from 1 to another value? For example, set it to 2 (action 2: up, right, down). But again, without knowing the grid dynamics, it's hard to predict.

Alternatively, perhaps setting state 0 to action 3 (left, up, right) might lead it towards the goal better. Or maybe action 0 (down, left, up), which could move it down from state 0 to state 4.

Wait, in the top-performing trajectory provided earlier, when params[0] is 1, the agent took action 3, leading to state 3, then action 2, etc. So perhaps changing some parameters in that area might help.

But since I can't see all hole positions, perhaps the best approach is to create a policy that tries to move towards the goal as much as possible while allowing exploration through varied actions.

Given that, maybe setting each state's action based on its proximity to the goal. For example:

- States closer to the goal (right and bottom rows) should have actions that encourage moving right or down.
- Central states might benefit from a mix of movements.

But without knowing where the holes are, this is speculative. Maybe I can try setting all parameters to 3 except for certain key positions. Or perhaps set some parameters to different values to see if that improves reward.

Alternatively, since the previous top policy had f(params) at 0.45, which is higher than others, maybe tweaking a few parameters in that policy could lead to better results. For example, changing params[1] from 3 to another action might help avoid holes or reach the goal faster.

In any case, given that I need to propose a new set of params without repeating previous ones, I'll try modifying some actions in the top-performing param slightly.

Looking at the top-performing param:

params[0]:1; params[1]:3; ... ; f(params): 0.45

Let me change params[0] from 1 to 2 and see if that helps. Or perhaps change another parameter, like params[7], which was set to 2.

Alternatively, maybe setting more states in the bottom row to action 3 could help reach the goal. For example, state 15 is the goal, so it's irrelevant once reached, but other states in the last row should aim to move right or down.

But without knowing hole positions, this is challenging. Maybe a better approach is to randomize certain parameters to explore different paths and see which ones yield higher rewards.

Alternatively, since I'm supposed to maximize information gain, perhaps choosing a param set that explores new trajectories that haven't been tried before could help identify better policies.

Given all this, I'll propose a new params array where I change several actions from the top-performing policy. For example:

- Change params[0] from 1 to 2
- Change params[4] from 0 to 1
- Adjust some other parameters to see different trajectories

But without knowing which specific changes will help, it's a bit of a gamble. However, since the current rewards are low, it's better to try varied actions.

Alternatively, perhaps setting all states except the goal to action 3 could lead to more exploration and potentially find a path that avoids holes.

Wait, but in the previous attempts, some params had many 3s and still didn't perform well. So maybe that approach isn't the best.

Perhaps another strategy is to have each state choose actions that prioritize moving towards the goal, considering their current position. For example:

- From states in the first row (0-3), prefer moving right or down.
- From states in other rows, also move towards the bottom-right.

But without knowing the grid layout and hole positions, it's hard to be precise.

In conclusion, given that I need to propose a new set of params, I'll create a configuration where each state is assigned an action that encourages movement towards the goal. For example:

- States in row 0 (0-3): Action 2 or 3 (right or up/down)
- States in column 3 (3,7,11,15): Move down if not already at the bottom
- Other states: A mix of actions to encourage movement towards the goal

But I'll have to map this out numerically.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to assign each state an action that maximizes the chance of moving towards the goal. For example:

- For states in row 0 (top row), set action to 2 or 3 to move right or down.
- For states not in the top row, set action to 0 or 1 to move down or left/right.

But I'm not sure if this will work.

Alternatively, perhaps assign each state an action that has a higher probability of moving towards the goal. Since each action leads to three possible moves, maybe choosing actions that include the desired direction as one of the options increases the chance.

For example:

- For states in row 0, set action to 2 (right, up, down) since moving right is towards the goal.
- For other states, choose actions that include moving down or right as possible moves.

But I'm not sure about this either. Maybe a better approach is to look at the best previous params and tweak them slightly.

Looking back, the top-performing param had:

params[0]:1; ... ; f(params): 0.45

So let's try changing some of these parameters to see if that improves reward. For example, change params[0] from 1 to 2, params[2] from 1 to 3, etc.

But without knowing the exact effects, it's challenging.

Alternatively, perhaps setting all states except those near the goal to action 3 (exploration) and near the goal to specific actions could help.

In any case, I'll propose a new set of parameters where some key states are adjusted from the previous best.
