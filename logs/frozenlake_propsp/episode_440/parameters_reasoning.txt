You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The environment is a 4x4 grid where each state corresponds to a number from 0 to 15. The agent can move in four directions: up, down, left, right. But because the ice is slippery, when the agent takes an action, it randomly moves in one of three possible directions with equal probability.

The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) for a reward of +1, while avoiding holes which end the episode immediately. The policy is defined by an array of 16 numbers where each element indicates the action taken from that state.

Looking at the user's message, they provided some top-performing params and recent ones along with their rewards. The highest reward observed so far is 0.30, which is significantly below the target of around 1.0. This suggests there's room for improvement.

The most recent policies have lower rewards, like 0.10, 0.05, or even negative. So maybe we're not exploring effectively yet.

I need to propose a new set of params that are different from previous ones and could lead to higher rewards. Since the goal is state 15, I should focus on states near it and ensure their policies guide towards it without falling into holes.

Looking at the grid layout:

- State 0: top-left
- State 3: top-right
- State 4: second row first column
- ...
- State 12: third row first column
- State 15: bottom-right (goal)

Holes are present, but their exact locations aren't specified. I need to make sure that the policy avoids actions leading into holes.

Perhaps focusing on states near the goal and ensuring they have policies that move towards state 15 would help. Also, states near the edges should be cautious about moving out of bounds or into holes.

Let me think about each state:

- State 14: top-right of the third row. If the agent is here, it's close to the goal (state 15). So action could be right or down.
- State 13: middle of the third row. Maybe move right towards 14 or down.
- Similarly for other states.

But since I don't know where the holes are, maybe a safer approach is to have policies that generally push towards the goal but avoid edges unless certain it's safe.

Looking at previous params, many had action 2 (right) and 3 (up). Maybe mixing actions to increase the chance of moving towards the goal without getting stuck in loops or falling into holes.

I think a good strategy is to make states near the bottom and right prefer moving towards state 15. For example:

- States 12,13,14: move right or down.
- States on the third row (8-11): prioritize down or right to approach the goal.
- Upper rows should navigate towards lower-right directions.

I'll propose a new params array where each state's action is chosen to generally move towards the bottom-right while avoiding obvious paths into holes. For example, states near edges might prefer staying in bounds by moving towards the center or goal.

Wait, but without knowing the hole positions, it's tricky. Maybe setting up a general policy that moves right and down as much as possible, with some randomness to avoid getting stuck.

Alternatively, maybe using a greedy approach where each state chooses the action that has the highest probability of eventually reaching the goal without falling into holes. But since we don't know the hole locations, this is challenging.

Another thought: if previous policies have low rewards, perhaps the agent is failing to reach the goal often. Maybe adjusting the policy so that states closer to the goal have higher priority to move towards it, while others explore more.

Perhaps setting params for state 15 as a terminal state (no action needed), but in our case, it's already the end. For other states, actions should be chosen to maximize the chance of moving closer to 15 without stepping into holes.

I'll try to create a new set where:

- States 0: move right or down.
- States on the top row (0-3): prefer moving down to avoid edges and potential holes in the first column.
- Middle states should have varied actions, maybe preferring right and down.
- Near the goal (states 14,15), ensure they move towards each other.

I'll draft a params array where:

params[0] = 2 (right)
params[1] = 3 (up? Maybe not, since top row can't go up. Wait, the action definitions are a bit unclear. Let me check.

Wait, according to the user's message:

- Action 0 leads to [down, left, up]
- Action 1 leads to [right, down, left]
- Action 2 leads to [up, right, down]
- Action 3 leads to [left, up, right]

So each action has three possible moves. So for example, if the agent is in state 0 and takes action 0, it can go down (state 4), left (invalid, wraps around?), or up (also invalid). Wait, actually, since it's a grid, moving beyond boundaries might not be allowed. Or perhaps the environment handles it by staying in place.

Wait no, in standard FrozenLake, movement is such that trying to move outside the grid stays put. So for state 0 (top-left), moving up or left would keep it in state 0. But according to the problem statement, when taking an action, it picks from three directions with equal probability, but I'm not sure if invalid moves result in staying or maybe they loop.

This is important because choosing actions that have higher probabilities of leading towards the goal without getting stuck in loops.

Given this, perhaps for state 0:

If we choose action 1 (which allows right, down, left), moving right would take it to state 1. Moving down takes it to 4, and moving left keeps it at 0 with some probability.

But since action 1's possible moves are right, down, or left, maybe choosing action 1 for state 0 is better as it has a chance to move right (to state 1) or down (state 4), both of which are towards the goal.

Alternatively, action 2 (up, right, down). Up is invalid, so it would have a higher chance to go right or down. Wait no: each direction in the possible set has equal probability, but if one direction is invalid, does it just choose from valid ones? The problem statement isn't clear on that.

Wait, re-reading the user's message:

"When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability."

So each action leads to three possible moves, regardless of whether they are valid. So for state 0, taking action 0 would allow moving down (state 4), left (state 3?), or up (invalid, but perhaps stays in place? Or maybe it's considered as not moving.)

Wait no, the grid is 4x4, so each move changes the state accordingly.

For example:

State 0: row 0, column 0.

- Move down: row+1 → state 4.
- Move left: column-1 → since it's at column 0, maybe stays in same row but column wraps? Or perhaps invalid moves stay put. The problem statement isn't clear on this.

But the environment is slippery, and when taking an action, it goes to three directions with equal probability. So for each action, there are three possible outcomes, regardless of the state's position.

Thus, for state 0:

- Action 0: move down (state 4), left (invalid; perhaps treated as a no-op?), or up (no-op?).

But in reality, moving left from column 0 would probably stay in the same column or wrap around, but I think it's more likely that invalid moves result in staying in place.

So for state 0:

- Action 0: possible to move down (state4), left (stay at 0), or up (stay at 0). So the probabilities are 1/3 each. But since moving left and up both stay, it's actually a 50% chance of staying and 25% to go to state4.

Alternatively, perhaps all three directions are considered, but moving in impossible directions is treated as not changing state. Or maybe they loop around, which would complicate things.

Given the uncertainty, I think it's safer to assume that invalid moves result in no change (stay in place). So for state 0:

- Action 1: move right (state1), down (state4), or left (no-op). So the possible outcomes are stay, move right, or move down.

Therefore, action 1 from state0 gives a chance to move towards the goal by moving right (to state1) or down (state4).

Similarly, for other states:

- States near the edges should choose actions that have higher probabilities of moving in safe directions towards the goal.

Given this, perhaps setting up policies where each state prefers actions that increase their likelihood of moving closer to the goal while avoiding paths leading into holes.

Since I don't know the hole positions, it's a bit challenging. But maybe by looking at previous trajectories, I can infer possible hole locations.

Looking at the top 6 params:

For example, one trajectory was (0,1) → (4,2) → (8,2). Then it ended with reward 0.30. So perhaps state8 is a safe state, and moving from there leads closer to the goal.

Another trajectory had (0,3) leading to (0,3), suggesting that maybe taking action3 in state0 leads to staying in place or looping around without progress.

Alternatively, if state3 has a hole, then taking actions that lead there would be bad. But without knowing, I have to proceed carefully.

Given the current setup, perhaps proposing a policy where each state chooses an action that maximizes the chance of moving right or down, which are towards the goal.

So for states in row 0 (states 0-3), prefer actions that can move right or down. For example:

- State0: choose action1 (right, down, left) → possible to move right or down.
- State1: choose action2 (up, right, down) → can move up, right, or down. But moving right from state1 would go to state2, which is not closer. Maybe better to move down or right towards the goal.

Wait, actually, moving down from any row brings you to the next row, which is towards the bottom. Moving right increases the column index, towards 3 (the rightmost in each row).

So perhaps setting up a policy where:

- For states not in the last row or column: choose actions that can move right or down.
- For states in the last row or column: choose actions to stay or move towards goal.

But without knowing hole positions, it's hard to say. But maybe setting all non-terminal states to choose action2 (up, right, down) which allows a mix of moving up, right, or down.

Alternatively, for each state, choose the action that has the highest chance of eventually reaching the goal, considering possible slippery moves.

Wait, but since actions are probabilistic, perhaps we need policies that balance exploration and exploitation.

Given all this, I think it's best to propose a params array where:

- States near the bottom-right (e.g., 12,13,14) choose actions that push towards state15.
- Middle states choose actions that have a chance to move right or down.
- Avoid actions that lead into probable hole locations based on previous trajectories.

Looking at the recent params, many had action patterns that didn't reach the goal. So maybe adjusting certain states' actions could help.

For example:

- State0: action1 (can go right or down)
- State1: action2 (up, right, down) → can move towards state4 or stay
- ...
But without knowing hole positions, this is speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps all states should choose the same action to maximize consistency. For instance, setting all params to 3, which includes right, up, and left moves. But that might not be optimal.

Wait, another approach: since each action has three possible outcomes, maybe a policy where each state randomly selects one of four actions can lead to higher exploration. But the user's problem requires proposing specific params, so I need to define each state's action.

Given the time constraints and information available, perhaps I should suggest a new set of params that are different from previous ones but follow a logical pattern towards the goal.

I'll propose:

- For states in row 0: choose action1 (right, down, left) → can move right or down.
- States in rows 1-2: choose action3 (left, up, right) → allows moving in various directions.
- States in row 3 (last row): choose action2 (up, right, down) → but since they're already in the last row, maybe action0 to move left or down.

Wait, state15 is the goal. So when in state14, choosing action2 would have possible moves up, right, or down. But being in state14, moving right leads to 15 (goal), so that's ideal.

So perhaps:

- State14: choose action3 (right, up, left) → higher chance to move right.
- Similarly, state13: action2 (up, right, down) → can move right or down.
- States in column 3 (except goal): choose actions that push towards the next row or right.

But without knowing hole positions, it's still risky. However, given that previous policies didn't reach high rewards, this approach might help.

I'll draft a params array where:

- For states in rows 0-2: prefer action1 and action3 to allow movement right and down.
- For state15: no action (but it's already the end).
- For other states, set actions that encourage moving towards the goal.

Alternatively, perhaps setting all non-goal states to choose action2 or 3 to have a mix of up/right/down/left movements, increasing chances of reaching the goal without getting stuck.

I think I'll proceed with creating a new params array where:

params[0] = 1 (action1)
params[1] = 3
params[2] = 2
...
But perhaps it's better to define each state based on its position, choosing actions that can move right or down.

Given the time constraints, I'll propose a new set of params where:

- States in row 0: action1 (right, down, left)
- States in rows 1-2: action3 (left, up, right)
- State15: no action needed

So for example:

params[0] = 1
params[4] = 1
...
But I need to define all 16 params.

I'll make a tentative proposal where states in the top row choose action1, middle rows choose action3, and bottom rows choose action2.
