You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out the best action to take at each state in this FrozenLake environment. The policy is a function that maps states (0-15) to actions (0-3). Each action affects where the agent moves next based on certain probabilities.

First, I recall that when an action is taken, especially when it's 2 or 9, the agent has two possible directions chosen randomly among three options. But if the action is 0 or 1, all transitions are equally likely. So, for each state, I need to compute the expected reward from taking each action and choose the one with the highest expected value.

Looking at the provided examples, when the action is 2 (up), there's a 2/3 chance of moving in three directions, so two actions have an equal probability, but this might not be optimal. When action 1 is taken, the transitions are between right, down, and left with equal probabilities, which could lead to different states.

I think I should calculate for each state (0-15) what's the expected reward for taking each action and choose the highest one. Since I don't have all the data, I'll focus on known optimal points. For example, certain positions near the goal (state 15) might require specific actions to avoid falling into holes.

In some examples, taking action 0 (left) from state 3 leads directly to the hole at state 4. So, action 0 isn't good there because it risks stepping into a hole. Instead, other actions are better there.

By analyzing these examples, I notice that in positions around the edges or near holes, certain actions are safer and more rewarding. For instance, when on state 3 (top-right corner), taking action 2 might lead to safe moves, avoiding immediate pitfalls.

Putting this together, I decide that a policy of mostly choosing directions with two possible options but favoring left and right could maximize the chances of moving toward the goal without risking stepping into holes. This approach should balance risk and reward effectively.
