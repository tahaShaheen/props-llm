You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15, which gives a reward of +1, while avoiding holes that end the episode with 0 reward. The environment is slippery, meaning each action has three possible outcomes with equal probability.

First, I need to understand how the actions work in terms of movement. Each action (0-3) leads to different directions. For example, action 0 can move down, left, or up. But since it's slippery, there's a lot of uncertainty in where the agent actually ends up after taking an action.

Looking at the params array, each value from 0 to 15 represents a state, and the corresponding number is the action taken when in that state. The challenge is to set these actions such that the agent navigates towards the goal (state 15) while avoiding holes.

The best performing policies so far have an average reward around 0.45, which is below the target of 1.0. This suggests that we're not yet optimal and need to explore more.

I notice that in the top params, there's a lot of variation in actions, especially in states near the start. For example, state 0 might be taking action 1 or 2, leading it towards different directions. The trajectories show that sometimes the agent gets stuck in loops or ends up in holes, indicating that some policies are not effective.

Since we're at iteration 1153 out of 5000, there's still a lot of room for exploration and optimization. Given that the rewards aren't close to 1.0 yet, I should focus on exploring different strategies rather than exploiting the current best ones.

One approach is to set policies that move the agent towards the right or down since those are the directions leading closer to state 15 (bottom-right corner). For example, states in the top row might benefit from moving right or down. However, due to the slippery nature, I need to ensure that even if there's a slight chance of moving left or up, it doesn't lead into a hole.

Looking at the recent params, some have high exploration but low rewards. Maybe adjusting certain key states' actions could lead to better paths. For instance, state 0 (top-left) might be set to action 2 (right), which could help move towards the goal more directly.

I should also consider that each action has a 1/3 chance of going in different directions. So, for states near holes, it's crucial to choose actions that minimize the risk. For example, if state 4 is adjacent to a hole, choosing an action that moves away from it would be better.

After considering all this, I'll propose a new set of params where each state is assigned an action that generally moves towards the goal while avoiding known holes based on previous trajectories.
