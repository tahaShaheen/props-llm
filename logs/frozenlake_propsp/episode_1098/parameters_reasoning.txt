You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me start by understanding the problem deeply.

The grid is 4x4, and each state is represented from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). The goal is to reach state 15, which gives a reward of +1, while all other states give 0. However, there are holes in some grids that end the episode immediately if stepped on.

The environment is slippery, meaning each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability. The actions are as follows:
- Action 0: move down, left, or up
- Action 1: move right, down, or left
- Action 2: move up, right, or down
- Action 3: move left, up, or right

The policy is an array of 16 elements (params[0] to params[15]), each taking values from [0,1,2,3]. The task is to find the optimal policy that maximizes the average reward over 20 episodes.

Given that we're at iteration 1098 out of 5000, and I need to propose the next set of params based on the previous data. 

Looking at the provided top 5 best-performing params, all have f(params) around 0.35-0.45. The most recent params have lower rewards, suggesting that maybe we're not yet close to the optimal policy.

Since the global optimal should be around 1.0, which indicates success, I need to explore more. The current policies aren't reaching the goal reliably, so perhaps they're falling into holes or getting stuck in loops.

I remember that in FrozenLake, the optimal strategy often involves moving right and down when possible, avoiding the holes. But with the slippery nature, the agent's actions are uncertain, so the policy needs to account for all possible moves.

Let me think about each state:

- State 15 is the goal; it should stay as is (maybe not part of params).
- States adjacent to 15 (like 14 and 11) should move right or down.
- The start state (0) should probably move right to increase chances of moving towards the goal.

Looking at the current policies, some have params[0] set to 1 or 2. Let me try varying these actions to see if a different initial action could lead to better exploration.

I also notice that in the most recent trials, there were trajectories where the agent took too long or fell into holes. So maybe adjusting certain states' actions can help avoid those holes.

Perhaps I should change some of the params for states near the top-left and middle areas to encourage moving towards the goal while avoiding dangerous moves.

I'll try creating a new policy where each state's action is chosen to maximize the chance of eventually reaching 15 without hitting any holes. This might involve setting certain states to move right or down more often, considering the possible slipperiness.

Wait, but since each action leads to three possible directions, I need to choose actions that, on average, bring the agent closer to the goal while minimizing risks of falling into holes.

I think a greedy approach could be effective here. For example, in states where moving right or down brings the agent closer to 15, setting those as primary actions might help.

Let me outline possible directions for each state:

- State 0 (top-left): Moving right is better than down because it's already on the top row.
- States near the bottom-right (like 12,13,14,15) should move towards 15.
- Middle states need to balance between moving right and down.

I'll try setting params for each state to prioritize actions that lead closer to 15. For example:

- In state 0, choose action that can move right or up/down but considering the best path.
Wait, action 0 from state 0 would allow moves down (to 4), left (invalid, wraps around?), or up (invalid). So maybe action 1 is better for state 0 to try moving right.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe testing different actions and seeing how they perform in the next iteration will help.

I think it's time to propose a new set of params that are distinct from previous ones, focusing on exploring paths towards the goal while avoiding holes.
