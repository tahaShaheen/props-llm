You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) while avoiding holes. The agent moves in a 4x4 grid, and each action has three possible outcomes due to the slippery nature of the environment.

From the problem statement, I know that the policy is an array of 16 integers, each representing the action taken from states 0 to 15. The rewards are around 0.05 in previous attempts, which is much lower than the target of 1.0. So, it's clear that we're not yet exploiting effectively; instead, we might still be exploring.

Looking at the trajectories provided, most of them end quickly without reaching the goal or falling into a hole. For example, one trajectory ends at state 8 after taking action 2, which suggests that maybe the policy isn't guiding towards state 15 properly.

I need to consider what actions would lead closer to state 15. Let's think about each state:

- State 0 (top-left corner): The best move might be right or down. But since it's slippery, choosing an action that has a higher probability of moving in the desired direction is tricky.
- States near the goal (like 12, 13, 14) should push towards state 15.

Perhaps I should design the policy to guide the agent towards the right or down as much as possible. For instance:
- From states that are on the top row, encourage moving right or down.
- From leftmost columns, encourage moving right.
- From middle rows and columns, maybe alternate between right and down based on position.

But considering the slippery nature, each action has three possible outcomes. So, for example, choosing action 0 might move down, left, or up. Maybe selecting actions that have a higher chance of moving towards the goal despite the slipperiness is key.

Looking at the action definitions:
- Action 0: down, left, up.
- Action 1: right, down, left.
- Action 2: up, right, down.
- Action 3: left, up, right.

So, for state 0 (top-left), to move towards the goal (right or down):
- Action 1 has a chance to go right, which is good. So maybe set params[0] = 1.
- Similarly, other states can be analyzed.

I should also ensure that from any state near a hole, the policy avoids actions that could lead there. For example, if a hole is at state 5, then in states adjacent to it, certain actions might increase the risk of falling into the hole.

But since I don't know where the holes are exactly, maybe focusing on getting to the goal is more important. However, given the trajectories, the agent isn't reaching the goal often, so perhaps the current policies aren't leading towards state 15 effectively.

Another approach could be to try policies that have a higher tendency to move right and down, which would generally lead towards the goal. For instance, setting params[i] for states on the top row to action 1 (right), except when near edges where moving down might make more sense.

Alternatively, using a more systematic approach, perhaps assigning actions based on grid positions:

- Top row: move right or down.
- Left column: move down or right.
- Other states: prefer right and down.

But since each action has three possible directions, it's not straightforward. For example, choosing action 2 from state 0 might sometimes take the agent up (which would be bad), so maybe that's riskier than action 1 which can go right.

Wait, looking at the previous params where f(params) was around 0.05, most trajectories end without reaching the goal. So perhaps we need to find a policy that more consistently navigates towards state 15.

I think I should propose a policy that encourages movement towards the goal as much as possible, considering the slipperiness. Maybe setting all params to action 2 for states where moving right or down would help reach the goal, but I'm not sure if that's optimal.

Alternatively, perhaps trying different combinations to see which leads closer to the goal. For example, set some states to action 1 (right) and others to action 0 (down). Maybe mixing these actions can lead to a better path despite the slippery nature.

Given that in previous attempts, the rewards were low, I think we need to try a different policy that might get closer to the goal. So perhaps changing some of the params from their current values to push towards state 15 more effectively.

After considering all this, maybe setting most of the states to action 2 or 3, which have right and up/down probabilities, could help navigate towards the goal better. Alternatively, focusing on action 1 (right) for top row states might be beneficial.

In conclusion, I'll propose a new set of params where each state is assigned an action that has the highest probability of moving towards the goal. For example, setting states closer to the goal to have actions that move right or down.
