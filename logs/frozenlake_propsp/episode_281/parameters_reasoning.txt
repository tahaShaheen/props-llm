You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment using a reinforcement learning approach. The problem specifies that the policy is represented by an array of 16 parameters (one for each state), and each parameter can be set to 0, 1, 2, or 3. My goal is to determine which values for these parameters will maximize the episodic reward f(params) across all iterations up to 400.

First, I need to understand how the policy works. The agent's state is represented by a number from 0 to 15, each corresponding to a grid cell in a 4x4 grid. The allowed actions are moving down, left, right, or up. However, when an action is taken, the next state and reward have specific probabilities based on the current state.

Looking at the problem statement, I see that for each action (0-3), certain transitions are possible with equal probability. For example:
- Action 0 comes from moving down, left, or up.
- Action 1 comes from right, down, or left.
- Action 2 is from up, right, or down.
- Action 3 is from left, up, or right.

The goal state is 15 (the bottom-right corner), which yields a +1 reward. All other states give a reward of 0. There are holes in the map that can trap the agent, meaning if it steps on them, the game ends immediately once taken.

I should note that each action has equal probability when chosen by the policy. The challenge is to find the best set of parameters (action probabilities for each state) such that the expected reward from any starting state is maximized over time.

Given the complexity of evaluating every possible combination of actions, a suitable approach would be to use a Q-learning algorithm with exploration strategies like ε-greedy or Boltzmann exploration. However, since the goal is to find the global optimal policy within 400 iterations without prior knowledge, I might need to simulate multiple runs and keep track of the best reward encountered.

The user mentioned that I should propose parameters from [0,1,2,3] for each state, avoiding previously seen ones. Each run will provide a specific set of parameters and the corresponding f(params) at that iteration. After several iterations (up to 400), I can observe which combination yields the highest reward.

I'll start by proposing some initial parameters based on intuition about typical optimal policies. For example, in grid-based problems, often moving directly towards the goal is beneficial. However, avoiding holes might require more cautious exploration of surrounding states.

Considering that action 2 (up) is sometimes used to avoid obstacles, perhaps parameters where 0 and 1 are set to higher probabilities for certain states could be effective. For instance, allowing some randomness in taking steps toward the right side (state 15) while avoiding holes by sometimes moving up or left when necessary.

After several trials, each with a different combination of parameters, I should track which parameter sets yield the highest rewards and converge to an optimal balance between exploration and exploitation.
