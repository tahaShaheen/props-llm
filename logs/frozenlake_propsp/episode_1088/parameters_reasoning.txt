You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me start by understanding the problem.

So, it's a 4x4 grid with states numbered from 0 to 15. The agent can move in four directions—up, down, left, right—but because of the slippery nature, each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability. The goal is to reach state 15, which gives +1 reward, and avoid holes that end the episode.

The policy is a function params where each element corresponds to an action for a specific state. My task is to propose these parameters in such a way that maximizes the reward, ideally reaching around 1.0, which would mean successfully reaching the goal every time.

Looking at the provided examples, the top-performing policies have average rewards around 0.35 to 0.45. That's much lower than the target of 1.0, so clearly there's room for improvement. The recent attempts are even worse, sometimes getting zero reward, which means they're either falling into holes or not reaching the goal.

Since I'm acting as a stateless optimizer, I need to focus on maximizing information gain each time. Given that rewards are low, I should explore more. But also, since some policies have shown better results, maybe tweaking them slightly could help.

I notice that in the top 5 best params, certain patterns emerge. For example, params[0] is often 1 or 2, which correspond to specific actions. Maybe starting with a policy that tries to head towards the goal more directly would be better. Also, I need to ensure that the chosen actions don't lead into holes.

Another approach could be to set up policies where from each state, there's a higher chance of moving towards the right or down (since the goal is at 15). However, due to the slippery nature, we have to choose actions that maximize the probability of eventually reaching the goal without falling into holes.

I should also consider states around the edges and near the goal. For instance, state 14 is just one step away from 15 if moving right or down. So setting params[14] to an action that increases the chance of getting to 15 makes sense.

Let me think about each state:

- State 0 (top-left corner): Possible actions should move towards either right or down, avoiding left which would go out of bounds or into a hole if near.
- States along the top row: Moving right is safer unless there's a hole in that column.
- Middle states: Actions should guide towards the right and down direction.

I'll need to design params such that from each state, the chosen action has the highest probability of leading towards the goal without risking falling into a hole. Considering that each action leads to three possible moves, I might want to choose actions that have at least one safe move towards the goal.

For example, if in state 4 (top-middle), choosing an action that can move right or down would be better. Similarly, for states near the edges, avoiding left or up unless they lead towards the goal is crucial.

Maybe trying a policy where most states are set to action 1 (which allows moving right, down, or left with equal chance). But I need to check if this leads them towards the goal without falling into holes.

Wait, in the examples provided, when params[0] was 2, sometimes the trajectory went (0,1) -> (1,2), which might be a way to explore more.

I think the best approach is to set as many states as possible to actions that prioritize moving right or down. However, I also need to consider that some moves may lead into holes, so the policy must avoid those.

Given the information, I should propose a params array where most of the states choose actions that have a higher chance of leading towards the goal while avoiding risky moves. Maybe setting several key states (like near the goal) to specific actions that directly aim for 15.

After considering all this, here's a tentative plan:

- Set states closer to the goal (like 14 and 12) to actions that push towards 15.
- For middle states, choose actions that have multiple safe paths towards the right or down.
- Avoid actions that could lead into known holes.

I'll now try to construct such a params array. Maybe setting most of them to 1 or 3 to encourage movement towards the right and down. I need to ensure no state leads into a hole, but without knowing where exactly the holes are, it's tricky. However, based on previous trajectories, certain actions might be safer.

So, I'll proceed with setting params to prioritize right and down movements in states that can lead towards the goal.
