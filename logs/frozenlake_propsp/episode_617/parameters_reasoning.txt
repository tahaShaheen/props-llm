You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15, which gives a reward of +1, while avoiding holes that end the episode. The environment is slippery, meaning each action has three possible outcomes with equal probability.

First, I need to understand how the actions map to possible moves. Each action (0-3) leads to three directions. For example, action 0 can move down, left, or up. This makes the movement stochastic, so planning a deterministic path is tricky because the agent's next state isn't certain.

Looking at the policy parameters, each state from 0 to 15 has an associated action (0-3). The challenge is to choose these actions such that the agent maximizes the chance of reaching state 15 without falling into any holes. 

The user provided some top-performing params and recent ones, but all had relatively low rewards. Since we're at iteration 617 out of 5000, there's still a lot of room for exploration.

I recall that in the initial examples, certain policies led to trajectories that either reached the goal or fell into holes. For instance, one trajectory went (0,1) -> (4,2) -> (8,2), which didn't reach 15 but at least moved closer. Another trajectory was shorter and ended earlier.

Since the rewards are still below 1.0, I should act as an Explorer, trying out new configurations to gather more information. However, I also need to ensure that each proposed policy hasn't been seen before to maximize information gain.

Let me think about how to structure the next set of params. Maybe focus on states near the goal and see if there's a way to increase the probability of reaching state 15. For example, states 12 (bottom row left), 13, 14, and 15. Ensuring that from these states, the actions lead towards 15.

Looking at the grid, state 15 is the bottom-right corner. So to reach it, the agent should be moving right or down when in certain positions. However, due to the slippery nature, actions might not directly lead there but increase the chances.

For example, in state 14 (which is row 3, column 2), taking an action that has a high probability of moving right would help reach 15. Similarly, in state 13 (row 3, column 1), moving right or down could be beneficial.

I should also consider avoiding holes. From the examples given, some trajectories fell into loops or got stuck. So, ensuring that actions from each state don't lead to such situations is crucial.

Maybe I can propose a policy where states closer to the goal have actions that prioritize moving towards 15, while other states balance exploration and safe movement. For example, in state 0 (top-left), choosing an action that moves down or right could help start moving towards the goal.

Let me try constructing such a policy. Starting from the top:

- State 0: Let's choose action 2 (up). Wait, but action 2 for state 0 would move up, which might take it to state -1? No, in FrozenLake, I think moving beyond grid boundaries stays in place or wraps around? Wait no, in standard FrozenLake, moving left from the top row keeps you in the same position. So perhaps in this environment, if you're at state 0 and move up, you stay there.

Alternatively, maybe action 1 for state 0 would be better, as it can move right, down, or left. Moving right is towards the goal direction, so action 1 might be a good choice.

Wait, let me think again: Action 1 when in state 0 (top-left) will choose from [right, down, left]. So moving right takes you to state 1, down takes you to state 4, and left keeps you at 0. Since the goal is at 15, moving towards the right or down would be better.

So maybe in state 0, action 1 (which can move right) is a good choice. Similarly, in other states near the top-left, choosing actions that move towards the right or down could help progress towards the goal.

I also need to ensure that from any state, the chosen action doesn't have a high probability of leading into a hole. Since the user didn't specify where the holes are, I need to infer based on trajectories provided. For example, some trajectories ended quickly, which might indicate falling into a hole.

In the top-performing params, one had f(params) 0.30 and trajectory (0,1) (4,2) (8,2). So from state 4, action 2 was taken, leading to state 8. Then from state 8, action 2 led to... Well, I need to see what those transitions do.

Wait, maybe it's better to look for a policy that allows the agent to move towards the goal while minimizing the risk of falling into holes by avoiding certain actions in states near holes.

Another approach is to use a greedy strategy where each state chooses the action most likely to lead directly to the goal. But since the movement is stochastic, this isn't straightforward.

Perhaps I can structure the policy such that from each state, the agent has a high probability of moving towards the goal, considering all possible outcomes.

For example:

- States near the bottom-right (like 12,13,14) should prioritize right and down movements.
- Middle states should balance between exploring different paths while heading towards the goal.

Let me try to assign actions for key states:

- State 0: action 1 (right or down)
- State 1: action 3 (left, up, right) but since it's in the top row, moving down is better
- Wait, maybe state 1 can choose action 2, which allows moving up, right, or down. Moving down would take to state 5.

Alternatively, perhaps using a uniform approach where each state chooses an action that maximizes the chance of eventually reaching the goal through all possible paths.

But without knowing the exact hole positions, it's challenging. So maybe focusing on safe moves towards the goal is better.

I think I need to propose a new set of params that hasn't been tried before and explores different trajectories while avoiding previously seen configurations.
