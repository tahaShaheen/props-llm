You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 334 out of 400. OUTPUT ONLY THIS SINGLE LINE:

Do NOT output anything else. No explanation, no reasoning, nothing.



LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment with the slippery action rule. The goal is to reach state 15, which is the bottom right corner. All other states give a reward of 0, but stepping on a hole yields +1 reward. 

First, I need to understand the policy parameters. Each param represents an action when in a specific state. Since there are four actions (left, down, up, right), each param corresponds to a state from 0 to 15. The agent's strategy is represented by an array of these params.

The environment is slippery, meaning each action is chosen with equal probability when taking an action. So for any given action taken, the next state can be one of three directions uniformly. That complicates things because it means that even if I have a certain policy, the actual transitions are probabilistic based on this rule.

I need to find the best set of params values (0-3) such that the expected reward is maximized. Since each param is an action for its state, and actions can lead to different next states with equal probability, I'll need to simulate multiple runs of the agent using these parameters and calculate their average rewards.

But how do I choose which params to test? The user has given several examples, but only the best-performing ones. They seem to be trying various combinations, some increasing or decreasing action probabilities. However, without knowing which params are better, it's challenging to identify a clear pattern.

I think a good approach is to run multiple trials with different param settings. Since each trial uses the same max iterations and initial exploration, I'll need to run enough trials to average out variations due to randomness in transitions. Maybe 100 or more runs would be sufficient for convergence on the optimal policy.

Each trial will involve starting at state 0 and following the policy until the agent either reaches the goal (state 15) or gets stuck (falls into a hole). The reward is accumulated each time, so I'll need to average this over multiple trials to get an estimate of f(params), the total expected reward.

After running all these trials, I can find the params that give the highest average reward. This should help identify which combination of action probabilities leads to the best long-term outcome.
