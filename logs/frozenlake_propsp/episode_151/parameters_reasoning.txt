You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with a reward of +1, avoiding holes. The environment is slippery, so actions don't always lead directly to the intended state.

First, I need to understand how the slippery nature affects each action. For example, if an agent chooses to move right (action 0), it actually has a 33% chance to go down, left, or up instead. So, each action choice results in three possible next states with equal probability.

Looking at the current best policies provided, most of them have f(params) around 0.15, which is way below the target of 1.0. This suggests that the agent isn't consistently reaching the goal and might be getting stuck or falling into holes frequently.

I need to design a policy that maximizes the chance of reaching state 15 while avoiding known holes. From the trajectories given, some policies end quickly in states like 4,8, etc., which might indicate proximity to the goal but also could lead into holes if not careful.

Let me think about each state:

- State 0 (top-left corner): Moving right or down makes sense as moving up would take it out of bounds. But given the slippery nature, choosing an action that has a higher probability towards moving right or down might be better.
- States near the goal (like 12,13,14) should push the agent directly towards state 15.

Wait, I realize that the optimal policy should guide the agent towards state 15 as quickly as possible while avoiding any states leading to holes. Since the environment is slippery, the policy needs to be robust against the probabilistic movement.

Looking at the best-performing params provided earlier, they have alternating actions between 1 and 3, which might not be optimal because of the low rewards achieved. Maybe I need a more deterministic approach, but since the environment is slippery, it's tricky.

Perhaps setting all states near the goal to take actions that would most likely lead towards state 15. For example, from state 14 (which is directly above 15), choosing action right (action 0) might help reach 15, but considering the slipperiness, it could also go down or left.

Wait, maybe I should consider each state's possible transitions and set the policy to choose actions that have the highest probability of leading towards the goal without falling into holes. This would involve mapping out safe paths and ensuring that each action choice doesn't lead to a hole with high probability.

I might need to structure the policy so that states in the lower-right quadrant push towards state 15, while other states guide towards those quadrants. For example:

- States near the goal (like 12,13,14) should have actions that directly target moving right or down.
- Middle states should move towards the goal direction as much as possible.

But without knowing where the holes are exactly, it's a bit challenging. However, from the trajectories provided, some policies end quickly in certain states, which might indicate proximity to holes.

In the most recent params, some have f(params) around 0.10, suggesting that while they're not great, they're still providing data points. To maximize information gain, I should propose a new set of params that tests different actions, especially in critical states like near the goal or starting positions.

I think changing the policy for key states might help. For example:

- State 14: choose action right (0) to try to reach 15.
- States around it: ensure they move towards the lower-right.

But given that each action leads to three possible moves, maybe setting state 14 to take an action with a higher chance of moving down or right would be better. However, since all actions are equally likely, perhaps choosing any direction is similar, but it's better to choose one and see.

I'll propose a new policy where the agent tends to move towards the goal as much as possible. For example:

- From state 0 (top-left), choose action right (1) to go towards the goal.
- States in the top row: move right until reaching the end, then down.
- Middle states: move towards the lower-right quadrant.

But since actions are slippery, maybe setting all states to always try to move towards the goal direction. For instance:

- All even-numbered states (0,2,4,...) choose action 1 (right or something else), while odd-numbered states choose another action. But I'm not sure if that's optimal.

Alternatively, perhaps a simple policy where all states except the goal push down or right could be tried. For example:

- For each state, if possible, move towards the right or down to get closer to 15.

But considering the grid is 4x4 (0-3 rows and columns), moving right when in column less than 3, else down; similarly for other directions.

Wait, maybe a more structured approach: create a deterministic policy where each state chooses an action that leads towards the goal as much as possible, then test it. However, due to slipperiness, this might not always work but could be a starting point.

Given that all previous policies have low rewards, I should propose something significantly different to explore new trajectories and gather more data. Perhaps setting some states to take different actions than before, especially in key positions like near the goal or the starting state.

I think the best approach now is to create a policy where:

- The agent tries to move towards the right or down as much as possible.
- Avoids actions that might lead it back into areas with holes based on previous trajectories.

But without knowing the exact hole locations, I'll proceed by proposing a new set of params where each state chooses an action that would logically bring it closer to 15. For example:

- States in row 0 (top) choose right or down.
- States in row 3 (bottom) move towards column 3.
- Ensure states near the goal push directly towards it.

But considering slipperiness, maybe choosing actions that have a higher chance of moving towards the goal direction.

After thinking through, I'll propose a new set of params where:

- For even-numbered states, choose action 1 (which includes right, down, left), but in a way that prioritizes movement towards the goal.
- Adjust specific states to avoid known dangerous actions based on previous trajectories.

But given the lack of detailed hole locations, I'll proceed by suggesting a policy where each state has a specific action designed to move closer to the goal, considering the slippery nature. For example:

params[0]: 1 (right)
params[1]: 3 (left might not be good; maybe right is better)
...
Wait, perhaps setting all states except the last few to choose actions that would generally move towards the goal.

Alternatively, since most previous policies have low rewards, I should try a completely different approach. Maybe set all states to always choose action 1 or 3, which might spread out the movement more and avoid getting stuck.

But without knowing the hole locations, it's challenging. Perhaps trying to maximize exploration by varying the actions across states.

In conclusion, I'll propose a new set of params where each state has an action that varies from previous policies, ensuring we explore different trajectories to gather more data on which paths are safe and lead towards the goal.
