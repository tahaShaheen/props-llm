You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me first understand the problem thoroughly.

The environment is a 4x4 grid, which means there are 16 states (0-15). The agent can move in four directions: up, down, left, right. However, because the lake is slippery, each action leads to three possible next states with equal probability. For example, if the agent chooses to move right, it might end up moving down, left, or up instead.

The goal is state 15 (bottom-right corner), which gives a reward of +1. All other states give 0, except for the holes which end the episode immediately upon stepping on them. The policy is defined by an array of 16 actions, each corresponding to a state.

In the interaction process, I propose a set of params, and then receive feedback on their average episodic reward. The goal is to get as close to a reward of 1.0 as possible, which would indicate that the agent almost always reaches the goal without falling into any holes.

Looking at the provided data, the top-performing params have rewards around 0.45, which is lower than the target of 1.0. This suggests that none of these policies are optimal yet. The most recent attempts yielded even lower or zero rewards, possibly because they fell into holes more frequently.

Given that the maximum iterations are 5000 and we're currently at 1134, I need to adjust the policy to explore further without repeating previous configurations.

Since the rewards are still significantly below 1.0, my role should be as an Explorer. I should propose a new set of params that haven't been tried before, focusing on states near the goal and along common paths to state 15.

I'll start by considering what actions lead towards state 15 from neighboring states. For example, state 14 is one step left from 15; moving right would take it directly. Similarly, state 11 is above 15, so moving down would reach the goal. Therefore, setting params[14] and params[11] to actions that can move towards or stay in the goal area might be beneficial.

Looking at previous top params, many have params[15]=3, which suggests they are trying to go right or up from the goal state. But since 15 is terminal, perhaps it's better to set it to a safe action (like staying put). However, since reaching 15 ends the episode with +1 reward, maybe it's best not to change it.

For other states, I'll try setting actions that generally move towards the goal. For instance, in state 0 (top-left), moving right or down could be better. From state 3, moving down leads directly to state 7, which is in the second row.

I should also avoid actions that might lead into holes. Holes are states where stepping on them ends the episode, so policies must avoid these. Without knowing exactly where the holes are, I'll assume they're positioned similarly to standard FrozenLake (like state 5 being a hole). So, for example, in state 4, moving right leads to state 8, which is further down.

I need to generate a params array that's different from previous ones. Looking at recent attempts, many have params[0]=1 or 2. Maybe setting it to 3 (left) could explore a new path. However, since the goal is in the right, moving left might not be optimal unless it loops around.

I'll create a params array where each state's action leads towards the goal as much as possible while considering the slippery nature and avoiding known holes. I'll ensure that no previously used params are repeated and that the new configuration explores different paths to maximize information gain.
