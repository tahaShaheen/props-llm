You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. So, from what I understand, it's a 4x4 grid where each state can transition probabilistically because of the slippery nature. The goal is to reach state 15 with the highest possible reward, and there are holes that end the episode if stepped on.

Looking at the problem, the agent's policy is defined by an array of 16 values, each corresponding to a state (0-15) and indicating which action to take. The actions correspond to different movement options, but because of the slipperiness, each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability.

The user has provided some top-performing params and their trajectories. For example, one policy had an average reward of 0.45, but all recent ones have lower rewards, even some zero. So, it seems like most policies aren't performing very well yet.

I remember that the optimal reward should be around 1.0, which means reaching the goal consistently without falling into holes. To achieve this, the policy needs to navigate safely towards state 15 while avoiding any holes.

In the recent attempts, some trajectories are getting stuck in loops or immediately falling into holes. For example, one trajectory went (0,2) then (4,2), which led to a loop without reaching the goal. Another fell into a hole quickly after taking an action.

Given that, I need to propose a new set of params that can explore new paths without repeating previous attempts. Since the recent policies have lower rewards, especially zeros, it's probably better to act as an explorer and try different actions, especially in areas where there might be holes or where the current policies are failing.

I should make sure that each state's action choice leads towards the goal while minimizing the risk of hitting a hole. For example, states near the edges (like 0, 3, 12, etc.) might have higher risks, so their actions need to be carefully chosen.

Maybe I can try setting certain key states to specific actions that push towards state 15 and avoid areas with holes. For instance, in state 0 (top-left), moving right or down could help progress towards the goal. Similarly, in state 15, staying put isn't necessary since it's the goal.

But I'm not sure about all the hole positions, so exploration is crucial. Each new policy should try different paths to find which ones are safe and lead to the goal.

I think a good approach would be to set actions that generally move towards state 15 while allowing for some flexibility in case of slippery movement. For example, from state 0, moving right or down could be beneficial. From other states, similar directional pushes can help navigate towards the target.

So, I'll create a new params array where each state is assigned an action that moves it closer to state 15 as much as possible, considering the slippery nature. For example, from state 0, choosing right (action 1) or down (action 3). From other states like 1, maybe up or right.

But I need to ensure that these choices haven't been tried before. Looking back at previous params, some have used action 1 and 3 in certain states, so I should vary it a bit. Maybe assign different actions in key positions to see if they can avoid holes and reach the goal more effectively.

After considering all this, I'll propose a new set of params where each state's action is chosen to push towards the goal while exploring new paths that haven't been tried yet.
