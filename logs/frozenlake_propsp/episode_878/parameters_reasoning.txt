You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help optimize the policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with a reward of +1, avoiding holes along the way. The agent's actions are slippery because each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability.

First, looking at the problem statement, the policy is represented as an array of 16 elements (params[0] to params[15]), each corresponding to the action taken in that state. Each action can be 0, 1, 2, or 3, which determine the possible directions the agent will move with equal probability.

The challenge here is to design a policy that navigates the agent from the start (state 0) to the goal (state 15) without falling into any holes. Since the environment is slippery, the agent's chosen action doesn't directly lead to the intended state but instead has a 33% chance of moving in each of three directions.

Looking at the provided top 5 best performing params and their trajectories, it seems that most policies are getting stuck or not reaching the goal efficiently. For example, one trajectory went from (0,1) to (4,2) and then to (8,2), which is state 8, but didn't proceed further towards the goal.

I need to think about how each action in a given state affects the possible next states. The agent should be directed towards moving right or down since those are the directions that would lead closer to the goal (state 15). However, because of the slipperiness, we have to choose actions that maximize the chance of moving towards the goal while minimizing the risk of falling into holes.

Let me consider each state and figure out which action would best help the agent progress towards the goal:

- State 0 (top-left corner): Possible moves are down, left, or up. Since it's at the edge, moving left isn't possible without falling into a hole if that's where the hole is. So, actions should be either down (to state 4) or right (to state 1). But considering the slipperiness, choosing an action that has a higher chance of moving towards the goal.

Wait, actually, in the problem statement, each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability. For example, action 0 for state 0 would lead to down, left, or up. So, if the agent is at state 0 and takes action 0 (which is one of the actions), it can go down to state 4, left which might be a hole, or up, but since it's on the top row, moving up isn't possible, so perhaps it stays in place or falls into a hole. So, taking action 1 for state 0 would lead to right, down, or left. But if left is a hole, then moving left could end the episode.

Therefore, to avoid holes, the policy must choose actions that minimize the chance of stepping into holes and maximize the chance of moving towards the goal.

Looking at the recent trajectories, some agents are taking too long or getting stuck in loops, so maybe adjusting certain states' actions can help break those loops.

For example, state 15 is the goal. So, for all other states, the policy should guide the agent towards it without falling into holes.

I think a good strategy would be to have each state's action point towards the right or down direction as much as possible, considering their respective positions on the grid. However, because of the slipperiness, we need to choose actions that have the highest probability of moving in the desired direction.

Let me try mapping out the optimal directions:

- State 0 (row 0, column 0): To move right or down.
- Action options: Let's see what each action does here. Action 0 for state 0 leads to [down, left, up]. Left is a hole? So action 0 could lead to falling into a hole with probability 1/3. Action 1 for state 0 leads to [right, down, left], so again, moving left might be a hole. Therefore, maybe the best actions are those that have fewer chances of leading into holes.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to choose action 1 for state 0, which allows movement right or down but also includes left. But if left is a hole, this could still lead to failure. So, maybe instead, we need to find an action that avoids the direction towards the hole.

Wait, I might be overcomplicating this. Since each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability, perhaps the best approach is to choose actions for each state that have a higher chance of moving towards the goal and avoid holes.

Let me try constructing the policy step by step:

1. State 0 (top-left): Possible moves are right, down, or up. But up isn't possible because it's on the edge. So, action 1 would allow movement to state 1 (right), state 4 (down), or left which might be a hole. To avoid the hole, perhaps choosing an action that doesn't include moving left.

Wait, but in the problem statement, each action for each state has fixed possible moves. For example:

- Action 0: [down, left, up]
- Action 1: [right, down, left]
- Action 2: [up, right, down]
- Action 3: [left, up, right]

So, for state 0, which is (row 0, column 0):

- If the agent takes action 0: can move down to state 4, left which might be a hole (state -1 or out of grid?), or up, but since it's on row 0, moving up would probably stay in place or maybe wrap around? Wait, no. The environment is 4x4 grid, so moving up from state 0 would not change the position or perhaps lead to a hole.

Wait, this might be an important point. If the agent tries to move left from state 0 (which is column 0), it might either stay in place or fall into a hole. Similarly, moving up from row 0 could also lead to a hole or stay put.

So, for state 0:

- Action 1: possible moves are right (state 1), down (state 4), left (hole). So, taking action 1 gives a 2/3 chance of moving towards the goal (right or down) and 1/3 chance of falling into the hole.

Alternatively, if state 0's action is set to 2: possible moves are up (maybe invalid, leading to hole), right (state 1), down (state 4). So again, 2 valid directions and one that could be a hole.

So perhaps for state 0, it's better to choose an action that has the least chance of falling into a hole. But since all actions from state 0 have at least one direction leading towards a hole, maybe we need to balance between moving towards the goal and minimizing the risk.

Alternatively, perhaps state 0 can be set to move right (action 1), which gives a higher probability of moving towards the goal without immediately falling into the hole.

Moving on to other states:

- State 1: top row, second column. Possible actions would affect where it goes next. For example, action 3 for state 1 might lead to [left, up, right], which could be towards state 2 (right), back to state 0 (up if possible?), or left to state 0.

But again, considering the slipperiness, we need actions that push towards the goal.

Perhaps a better approach is to set each state's action such that it tries to move towards the right or down as much as possible. For instance:

- In row 0 (top), moving right towards higher column indices.
- In columns, moving down towards lower rows.

So for each state, choosing actions that have a higher chance of moving in the desired direction.

But because each action has three possibilities, it's not straightforward.

Another approach is to look at the optimal policy structure. The FrozenLake environment is a classic one, and I recall that the optimal policy usually involves moving towards the goal while avoiding holes. In this slippery version, the policy needs to account for the uncertainty in movement.

Given that the global optimal reward should be around 1.0, meaning the agent successfully reaches the goal most of the time.

Looking at the recent policies provided, they are getting rewards around 0.35-0.45, which is below the target. So, I need to propose a policy that can improve this.

Perhaps focusing on states near the holes and adjusting their actions to avoid them could help.

For example, in state 1 (top row, second column), if the action leads to moving left, which might be a hole, we should choose an action that doesn't include moving left. Looking at the possible actions:

- Action 0: [down, left, up] → includes left.
- Action 1: [right, down, left] → includes left.
- Action 2: [up, right, down] → no left.
- Action 3: [left, up, right] → includes left.

So, to avoid moving left from state 1, the best action would be action 2. Therefore, setting params[1] = 2 might help reduce falling into holes.

Similarly, for other states where certain actions lead towards holes, we should choose actions that minimize such risks.

Another important point is to ensure that once the agent reaches a state near the goal, it can move directly towards it without getting stuck. For example, in state 14 (third row, third column), which is adjacent to the goal (state 15), taking an action that moves right or down could lead to the goal.

Wait, state 14 is (3,2) because the grid is 0-based. The goal is at (3,3). So from state 14, moving right should take it to state 15. But due to slipperiness, action 2 for state 14 would allow movement up, right, or down. So choosing action 2 for state 14 gives a chance to move right and reach the goal.

But looking at the previous policies, some have params[14] set to 3, which might not be optimal.

Putting this all together, I think the optimal policy would:

- For each state, choose an action that maximizes the probability of moving towards the goal while avoiding directions leading to holes.
- In states where certain actions could lead to immediate failure (holes), select actions that avoid those directions.

Therefore, I'll propose a new set of params based on this reasoning. I'll ensure that for each state, the chosen action doesn't include directions towards known holes and increases the chance of moving closer to the goal.
