You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy parameters for the FrozenLake environment. The user mentioned that there's a slippery environment where each action has an equal probability of 3/4 when taken, except for the first action which can choose between three directions with equal chance. 

I remember from the examples provided that certain parameter values lead to higher rewards (like 1.0). But I need to consider all possible combinations since the parameters are in [0,1,2,3]. Each param represents an action when on a specific state. The goal is to find a combination of these actions that maximize the expected reward.

I should think about which actions are better when certain states are visited. For example, moving right (action 1) might be crucial for reaching the bottom-right corner, so sometimes it's beneficial to have this action more often. Similarly, up or down could be important in other parts of the grid. 

Since the policy is a vector of parameters, each element represents an action on its respective state. I need to balance between using high numbers (like 3) when necessary and low numbers (0 or 1) otherwise. Maybe using more aggressive actions can help avoid getting stuck in the holes, so sometimes higher values might be better.

Also, considering that the environment is slippery, not choosing certain directions could lead to slipping into the hole, which ends the game. So I have to ensure that the policy avoids these dangerous states as much as possible. 

After looking at the examples provided, it seems that some parameter configurations result in higher rewards. For instance, params[0] = 2 and params[1]=3 seem to be effective because they might cover both moving down and up directions when needed. But I'm not sure without testing.

I think a good approach would be to test various combinations of the parameters, starting with some that show higher rewards and see how they perform in different scenarios. It's important to try actions that are safe to take and also ones that can help reach the goal more easily.
