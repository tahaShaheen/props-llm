You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out the best way to set up the policy parameters for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) and get a reward of +1, while avoiding holes which end the episode.

First, let me understand the setup. The grid is 4x4, so states are numbered from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). Each state has an action that determines where the agent might move next, but because it's slippery, each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 actions. I need to choose for each state whether to move left (0), down (1), right (2), or up (3). But since the environment is slippery, the agent doesn't always go where it intends. For example, choosing action 0 from any state will make the agent attempt to move down, left, or up with equal chance.

The challenge is that some states are holes, and stepping on them ends the episode. So, I need to design a policy that avoids these holes while trying to reach the goal as efficiently as possible.

Looking at the recent trajectories provided, it seems like most policies have been yielding low rewards (around 0.1 or less). This suggests that either the agent isn't reaching the goal often or is falling into holes frequently. The optimal reward should be around 1.0, so we need to make significant improvements.

One approach is to try to structure the policy in a way that funnels the agent towards the goal without getting stuck in loops or near holes. Since each action leads to three possible moves, I can set up the policy such that from each state, the agent has a higher chance of moving towards the goal while avoiding dangerous areas.

For example, in the top-left corner (state 0), choosing an action that generally points right (action 1) might help move towards the goal. From other states near the edges or corners, similar directional choices can guide the agent closer to state 15.

I should also consider how each action's possible moves could lead to holes. For instance, if moving up from a certain state leads to a hole, I should avoid actions that might take the agent in that direction.

Given that previous policies have had low rewards, perhaps we need to explore more thoroughly and ensure that the agent doesn't get stuck in cycles or near the holes. Maybe setting some states to move towards the goal while others provide alternative paths if one direction is blocked by a hole.

Let me try to structure this step by step:

1. Identify the positions of the holes. Since they aren't explicitly given, I have to infer based on trajectories where agents have fallen into them. From the recent data, it seems like states 0 and 7 might be problematic because trajectories starting there led to falls.

2. For each state, choose an action that directs the agent towards the goal (state 15) while avoiding any known holes or directions that could lead to them.

3. Ensure that from each state, the possible moves have a higher chance of moving closer to the goal without getting trapped in loops.

Given this, perhaps setting up a policy where most states push towards the right and down directions would help navigate towards the goal. For example:

- From even-numbered rows (like 0, 2), encourage moving right.
- From odd-numbered rows (1,3), encourage moving down or right to approach the bottom-right corner.

But since each action leads to three possible moves, I need to make sure that at least one of those moves is towards the goal without risking falling into a hole.

Wait, but if the environment is slippery and any action can lead to multiple directions, maybe it's better to choose actions that maximize the chances of moving in the desired direction while leaving some flexibility.

Perhaps setting most states to action 1 (which leads to right, down, or left) could help. But I'm not sure if this would lead to getting stuck near holes.

Alternatively, using a more deterministic approach for certain key states might be better. For example, from state 0, choose action 2 (right), which can lead to moving right, up, or down. This increases the chance of moving right towards the goal.

Similarly, in other states closer to the goal, choosing actions that push towards the goal while avoiding left moves if they might lead to holes.

I think it's time to propose a new set of parameters that systematically guides the agent towards state 15 while avoiding known problematic areas. Since previous attempts have yielded low rewards, this suggests that we need more exploration or better directional guidance.
