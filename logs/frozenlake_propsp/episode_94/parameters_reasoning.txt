You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to find the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment with certain constraints and parameters. 

First, I need to understand the setup clearly. The environment is a 4x4 grid where each state is represented by a number from 0 to 15. The agent can move in four directions: down (action 0), right (action 1), up (action 2), and left (action 3). Each action has certain probabilities due to the slippery environment. When an action is taken, it leads to a different state with equal probability among its possible moves.

The reward structure is such that all states except the goal (state 15) give a reward of 0, and the goal yields a +1 reward. However, there are holes on some grid positions which end the game upon stepping onto them. The policy needs to explore these holes by learning from trajectories, meaning it should not just stick to previously seen policies but also consider new paths that might lead through unexplored areas.

The parameters array has 4 elements (since each state is represented by a single parameter in [0,1]). Each parameter can be 0, 1, 2, or 3. The current policy's reward is given by f(params), and the goal is to maximize this reward over iterations.

Now, considering that the optimal reward should ideally be around None (or as high as possible), but since some states lead directly to the goal with a +1 reward, I'd aim for policies that can efficiently reach state 15. The exploration strategy needs to balance local searching (not revisiting seen states) and global searching (exploiting new states) without getting stuck in holes.

Looking at the provided examples of parameters, several seem to perform well. For instance, params[0] being 2 means action 2 is taken when on top-left. This might help navigate towards higher reward areas without immediately stepping into a hole. Other parameters like params[1]=3 and params[4]=1 also suggest strategic moves that avoid immediate holes while still progressing towards the goal.

Considering possible parameter combinations, I should aim for policies that can reach state 15 efficiently. For example, params[0] = 2 (up) might help in moving around holes on the top row, which are common in this setup. Similarly, params[1]=3 and others with action 3 could help in different directions to avoid immediate penalties.

After analyzing various combinations, it seems that a combination where actions taken when on certain states prevent falling into holes while maximizing progress towards state 15 is ideal. For instance, having params[0] = 2 (up) allows the agent to move up from row 0 to row 2, avoiding the top-left hole. Similarly, choosing action 3 or 2 when in other positions might navigate around the grid without immediate penalties.

Based on this reasoning, I'll suggest parameters that allow for safe movement towards higher rewards and efficient exploration of new paths, thus maximizing the episodic reward.
