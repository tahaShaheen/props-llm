You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get an average reward of around 1.0, which means reaching state 15 consistently without falling into any holes.

First, let me understand the setup. It's a 4x4 grid where each cell represents a state from 0 to 15. The agent can move in four directions, but because it's slippery, each action leads to three possible next states with equal probability. The reward is +1 only when reaching state 15.

Looking at the previous policies and their rewards, I see that most of them have low rewards around 0.20 or even lower. That suggests that the current policies aren't very effective at reaching the goal or avoiding holes. My task is to propose a new policy that either explores more territories (if we're in an explore phase) or optimizes around the best so far (if we're in an exploit phase).

Since all recent rewards are below 0.3, which is significantly lower than the target of 1.0, I think we need to focus on exploration. The idea is to try new policies that haven't been tried before to gather more information about where the holes are and how to navigate effectively.

I should look for a policy that directs the agent towards state 15 while minimizing the chances of falling into holes. Maybe setting actions that move right or down more often could help, but considering the slipperiness, it's tricky.

Let me think about each state:

- State 0 (top-left): The best action might be to move right or down. But since moving up isn't possible from here, maybe action 1 (which can lead to right, down, or left) is a good start.

Wait, but looking at the movement options for each action:
- Action 0: move down, left, up
- Action 1: move right, down, left
- Action 2: move up, right, down
- Action 3: move left, up, right

So from state 0 (row 0, col 0), moving right would take it to state 1, and moving down to state 4. But since the environment is slippery, taking action 1 from state 0 could lead to state 1 (right), back to state 0 (left), or maybe even stay in place? Wait no, moving up isn't possible because it's at the top.

Wait, no: movement in directions that go out of bounds probably stays in the same cell. So from state 0, trying to move left would keep it in state 0, as would moving up. But since action 1 includes right, down, and left, taking action 1 from state 0 could take it to state 1 (right), stay at 0 (left), or move down to state 4.

So perhaps action 1 is a good idea for state 0 because it has the chance to move towards state 1 or 4. But since we're trying to reach state 15, which is in the bottom right, maybe moving more towards the right and down makes sense, but with consideration of holes.

But without knowing where the holes are exactly, I need a policy that avoids them based on previous trajectories. Looking at the top-performing policies, some had trajectories that ended quickly, like (0,1) leading to state 4 or others.

I think I'll propose a policy where each state's action is set in a way that generally moves towards the goal but also varies enough to avoid holes. Maybe alternating between moving right and down based on the state.

But since we can't remember previous attempts, I need to make sure this new policy hasn't been tried before. Looking at the most recent params, they've tried various combinations of 0-3 for each state. I'll try to find a unique combination that hasn't appeared yet.

Alternatively, maybe a deterministic approach where each state has an action that is chosen to maximize the chance of reaching state 15 without getting stuck in holes. For example, from states near the edges, choose actions that move towards the goal while avoiding edges where holes are likely.

Another thought: perhaps for each state, set the action that maximizes the probability of moving right or down, depending on their position. But considering the slipperiness, it's not straightforward.

Wait, maybe I should consider setting all states to action 1 except for those near the bottom row which would benefit from moving down, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps a policy that moves towards the goal in a way that covers more ground, allowing the agent to find the safe path through exploration.

Given that previous policies have low rewards, maybe I should try a more aggressive approach where each state pushes the agent towards the right or down as much as possible.

After considering all this, I think setting each state's action to either 1 (right) or 2 (up/right/down). Let me check if such a combination has been tried before. Looking at the top params, some have similar patterns but not exactly the same.

So here's an idea: for states in the first two rows, set actions that encourage moving right or down towards the goal, and for the lower rows, perhaps move right to reach state 15.

But without knowing hole positions, it's a gamble. However, since we're supposed to maximize information gain, I'll propose a new policy where each state has an action that is different from previous ones, ensuring exploration.

Let me construct a params array where each state is assigned a unique combination not seen before. For example:

params[0] = 1 (action 1)
params[1] = 2
params[2] = 3
...
But I need to make sure it's not repeating previous patterns.

Alternatively, perhaps set all even states to action 1 and odd states to action 2. But looking at previous params, that might have been tried already.

Wait, in the most recent params, some had a mix of actions like 1,3,2, etc., so maybe I can try setting each state to action 0 except for certain key positions.

Alternatively, let's make it so that from each state, there's a chance to move right or down, which are towards the goal. So perhaps:

For states in columns 0 and 1 (left side), set actions that include moving right. For states in rows above the third row, set actions that include moving down.

But I need to map this into action choices.

Alternatively, a more systematic approach: for each state, select an action that covers all possible directions but with a bias towards the goal.

Wait, maybe I can assign each state to an action that gives it the best chance of eventually reaching state 15 without getting stuck. For example:

- From state 0 (top-left), take action 1 (which can move right, down, or left). Moving right is better towards the goal.
- Similarly, from other states in the top row, set actions that encourage moving right or down.

But considering the slipperiness, it's not certain. Maybe setting all states to action 1 except for those where moving down is better.

Alternatively, perhaps using a grid-based approach: in each state, choose an action that points towards the next cell in the direction of the goal.

Wait, this might be too time-consuming without knowing hole positions. Since we're supposed to explore, I'll try a new configuration where each state has a unique action not seen before, ensuring maximum exploration.

Perhaps set each even-numbered state (0,2,4,...) to action 1 and odd-numbered states to action 3. Let me check if that's been tried before.

Looking at the top params, some have similar patterns but not exactly this one. So I'll proceed with that.
