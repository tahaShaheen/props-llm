You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, let's break this down. I'm trying to help find the global optimal policy for a FrozenLake environment with some specific slippery movement rules and holes. The goal is to reach state 15, which gives a reward of +1, while avoiding holes that end the episode.

First, understanding the environment: it's a 4x4 grid where each cell can be represented by a number from 0 to 15. Movement isn't straightforward because when you take an action, you have a 33% chance to go in one of three possible directions due to the slippery nature. So, for example, choosing action 0 (left) could result in moving down, left, or up with equal probability.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 parameters, each corresponding to a state and indicating which action to take. The challenge is to set these parameters such that the agent maximizes its reward, ideally reaching around 1.0, which suggests it's consistently achieving the goal without falling into holes.

Looking at the provided data:

- There are top 7 best performing policies with rewards averaging around 0.45. These seem to be close but not optimal yet.
- The most recent 5 policies have even lower rewards (mostly 0.00), indicating that some of these attempts might be hitting holes or getting stuck.

My goal is to propose a new set of params that either explores new territory if the current reward isn't close to 1.0, or optimizes around the best performing ones if it is.

Since the top policies have rewards of about 0.45, which is significantly below 1.0, I should act as an "explorer" and try different configurations that haven't been seen before. However, looking at the most recent params, there's a lot of variation, so maybe tweaking certain states could lead to better paths.

I need to identify which states are crucial for reaching the goal without hitting holes. For example, state 0 (top-left corner) should probably move towards the right or down since moving up isn't possible and left might not help. Similarly, state 15 is the goal, so it's likely safe once reached.

Looking at the trajectories, some of them are looping or getting stuck in cycles. To break this, maybe adjusting certain states to encourage more direct paths towards the goal.

I'll try modifying a few key states:

- State 0: Maybe action 2 (up) is risky since it might not move up but could go left or down. Instead, choosing action 1 or 3 could help navigate better.
- States near the edges should be cautious to avoid falling into holes. For example, state 7 is at the end of the second row; moving right from there would take it to state 8, which is in the third row.

Proposing a new set where certain key states have different actions, possibly changing from previous policies but avoiding repetition.
