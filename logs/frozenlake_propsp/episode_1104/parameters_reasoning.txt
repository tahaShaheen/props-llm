You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment problem. Let me try to understand what's going on here.

First, the environment is a 4x4 grid where each state is represented by numbers from 0 to 15. The goal is state 15, which gives +1 reward, and all other states give 0. However, there are holes that end the episode if stepped on. Since I don't know exactly where these holes are, I need to figure out a strategy that avoids them based on previous trajectories.

The policy is an array of 16 numbers, each from 0-3, representing the action taken in each state. The agent is slippery, meaning each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability. So for example, choosing action 0 could move down, left, or up, each with 1/3 chance.

Looking at the provided top and recent params, I see that the highest reward so far is 0.45, which is significantly below the optimal 1.0. This suggests that the current policies aren't reaching the goal reliably, perhaps because they're falling into holes or getting stuck in loops.

The most recent trajectories show that some policies either get stuck moving around without reaching the goal or fall into holes quickly. For example, one trajectory goes from state 0 to 1 to 2 repeatedly without making progress towards 15.

Given that the global optimal should be around 1.0, I need to propose a policy that can reliably reach state 15 with high probability. Since the agent is slippery, deterministic policies (like always moving right or down) aren't sufficient because they might not lead directly to the goal due to the movement probabilities.

I think a better approach would be to have each state choose an action that maximizes the chance of moving towards the goal, considering the possible slippery outcomes. For example, states near the bottom-right (like 12, 13, 14) should push towards 15 as much as possible.

Looking at the current top params, many have a mix of actions in the lower states, which might be causing uncertainty and leading to falls into holes. I need to adjust these to more directly aim for state 15.

I'll start by setting the last few states (like 12, 13, 14) to actions that would most likely move towards 15 if possible. For example:

- State 14: Action 0 (down) might not be useful since it's already at the bottom row, so action 2 or 3 could push right or up-right, but considering slippery, maybe action 2 is better.
- State 13: Maybe action 3 to try moving right or up-right.

But I'm a bit confused because of the movement probabilities. Each action leads to three possible moves, so it's more about increasing the chance to move in the desired direction.

Alternatively, perhaps setting all lower states (like from state 8 onwards) to always choose actions that push towards the bottom-right would be better. For example:

- States near the goal (12,13,14,15): set to action 3 or 0 to increase right and down chances.
- Middle states: choose actions that have a higher probability of moving towards the goal.

I also need to ensure that the policy doesn't step into holes. From the trajectories, some are getting stuck in loops or going into bad areas, so perhaps adjusting certain middle states to avoid those paths.

Let me try constructing a new params array:

- For states 0-3 (top row), encourage moving down to get closer.
- States 4-7: push towards right and down.
- Continue this pattern until the bottom-right.

But I'm not exactly sure about each state's best action. Maybe for now, I'll set all lower states (from 8 onwards) to action 2 or 3, which have a higher chance of moving right or down.

Wait, looking at the movement options:

- Action 0: [down, left, up]
- Action 1: [right, down, left]
- Action 2: [up, right, down]
- Action 3: [left, up, right]

So, to move towards the goal (state 15), which is at the bottom-right, from state 14 (which is just above 15), choosing action 0 would try to go down to reach 15. But because of slippiness, it might also go left or up. So maybe setting action 0 for state 14.

Similarly, state 13: action 2 could help move right, but it's on the third row. Hmm.

I'm getting a bit stuck here, so perhaps I should look at what others have done in similar FrozenLake problems. Usually, optimal policies are those that head directly towards the goal with the highest probability, considering slippiness.

In this case, since each action has three possible moves, maybe setting all states to move right or down as much as possible would help.

So, for state 0: action 1 (right, down, left). But perhaps moving down is better from top-left. So action 0 might be better.

Alternatively, in the initial state (state 0), choosing action 1 could help go right, but considering slippiness, it's risky. Maybe a balanced approach is needed.

I think I'll try to set states closer to the goal to have actions that directly target moving towards it, and others to move towards the goal as much as possible.

Given all this, perhaps setting most of the lower states to action 2 or 3, which include right and down movements, would be better. Let me construct a params array where:

- States 12: action 0 (down) since it's already in the bottom row.
- State 13: action 3 (right)
- State 14: action 0
- State 15: no action needed as it's the goal.

For other states, set to actions that push towards these lower states. For example:

- States 8-11: choose actions that move down or right.
- Middle states might benefit from action 2 or 3.

But I'm not exactly sure. Maybe another approach is to have all non-terminal states (except for holes) point towards the goal in a way that maximizes the chance of reaching it.

Given that, perhaps setting all states except 15 to move right or down as much as possible, considering their positions.

Alternatively, since I don't know the hole locations, but from the trajectories provided, some are getting stuck. Maybe making sure that certain middle states push towards the goal without looping.

I think for this step, given the current knowledge, I'll propose a params array where:

- States 0,1,2: action 1 (right)
- State3: action 2 (down or right)
- State4: action 1
- ... and so on, trying to push towards the goal.

But this is a bit vague. Given time constraints, I'll proceed with setting most lower states to actions that aim for the goal.
