You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to propose the next set of parameters for the FrozenLake environment. So, from what I understand, the goal is to get the agent to reach state 15 with the highest possible reward, avoiding the holes. The policy is defined by an array of 16 actions, each corresponding to a state.

Looking at the information provided, the top 5 best-performing policies have f(params) around 0.35-0.45, which is much lower than the target of 1.0. That suggests that we're not yet close to the optimal solution. The most recent policies are even worse, with rewards as low as 0.10 and some getting zero.

The environment is slippery, so each action has a 33% chance to go in one of three directions. This makes it tricky because even if the agent takes the right action, there's no guarantee it will move as intended. So, the policy needs to be robust against this randomness.

I notice that in the top params, many states are set to either action 1 or 3. For example, state 0 is often 1, which might mean moving down, left, or up with equal probability. But since the agent can't control the exact direction due to slipperiness, it's about choosing actions that statistically lead towards the goal.

The trajectories show that some agents get stuck in loops or fall into holes quickly. For instance, one trajectory ends after two steps because of a hole. This indicates that certain policies are not avoiding the traps effectively.

Since we're in iteration 1085 and need to maximize information gain, I should propose parameters that explore new areas rather than tweak existing ones. Maybe some states aren't being handled well, so changing their actions could lead to better exploration.

Looking at state 0: it's set to action 1 in the top params. If I change this to another action, like 2 or 3, maybe the agent can move towards the goal more effectively. Similarly, for other states near the edges or holes, different actions might reduce the chances of falling into traps.

I also need to ensure that all parameters are unique and haven't been tried before, as per the stateless strategy. So, I should look through previous params and avoid repeating any configuration.

Let me think about each state:

- State 0 (top-left corner): Current action is 1. Maybe try 2 or 3 to see if it leads towards the right or up.
- State 1: Currently 3. Perhaps trying a different action could help in moving down instead of randomly.
- States near the bottom-right, like 14 and 15, should have actions that push towards 15.

I'll create a new set where each state's action is changed from its current top value to another option, ensuring all are unique. For example:

params[0] = 2 (from 1)
params[1] = 2 (from 3)
...
This way, we explore different paths and see if they avoid holes better.

Now, I'll map out each state with a new action that's different from the top params, ensuring no duplicates. This should help gather more data on which actions lead to success.
