You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy parameters for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right corner) with the highest reward of +1, while avoiding holes on states 0-9 and other holes on states 10-14. The agent should explore through previously seen trajectories by learning from past experiences.

The policy parameters are an array of 16 numbers where each value represents the action (0 to 3) when in state i. I need to choose values from [0,1,2,3] for each parameter. The function f(params) is the total episodic reward up to that point, and I want to maximize this.

From what I understand, the agent's behavior should be to avoid falling into holes by exploring states 0-9 and others (10-14). Since the agent can only step into a state if it explores through previous trajectories, I'll have to make sure that the exploration doesn't lead the agent directly into a hole.

Looking at the examples provided in the discussion, one of them had parameters like [2, 3, 1, 3, ...]. That seems to encourage moving up, right, etc., which might avoid some holes. But I'm not entirely sure about all combinations.

I should consider the typical behavior in such environments: avoiding holes and exploring near them. So, maybe the optimal policy would have certain actions that lead away from holes.

Let me try to outline possible parameters:

- params[0] (top-left): If 1 means moving left, which might be a bad idea because it's the top-left corner. Maybe set this to 2 or 3 for up.
- params[1] (top-center) perhaps should avoid right moves as well since it's near state 15.
- params[2] is middle-right, so maybe avoid moving down here?
- params[3] could be a mix of left and up.

Wait, but I need to make sure that in states with holes (0-9), the agent doesn't fall. So, perhaps setting actions that prevent immediate steps into holes.

Another thought: Maybe the optimal policy is to never take action 1 (right) when on any hole state because it could lead directly into a hole. Similarly, avoid certain directions near the edges.

But without doing actual testing, I have to make educated guesses based on typical behavior. From what I recall in some RL examples, the optimal policies often involve exploring all possible actions except those that might get stuck or lead directly into holes.

So, perhaps setting params[0] = 3 (move up) when on top-left, and not on any hole. Similarly, ensure that other directions are taken carefully to avoid falling into holes nearby.
