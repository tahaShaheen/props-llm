You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, let's try to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. So, from what I understand, it's a 4x4 grid where the agent can move in four directions, but because of the slippery nature, each action leads to one of three possible moves with equal probability. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) for a reward of +1, and there are some holes that end the episode if stepped on.

The user has provided some top-performing params along with their rewards and trajectories. Looking at these, most have f(params) around 0.15 or lower, which is significantly below the target of 1.0. This suggests that the current policies aren't very effective at reaching the goal consistently. Since the global optimal should be around 1.0, we're probably in the exploration phase where we need to find better strategies.

The recent params all have low rewards (mostly 0.0 or 0.1), so according to the user's strategy, I should focus on exploring new configurations rather than optimizing existing ones. The goal is to maximize information gain by proposing a completely different set of parameters that haven't been tried before.

Looking at the top-performing params, they seem to have varied actions but not a clear path towards state 15. Maybe I need to create a policy that directs the agent more directly towards the goal while avoiding holes. For instance, states near the bottom-right should encourage moving right or down as much as possible, considering the slippery nature.

I'll try setting params for the lower-right section (like states 12, 13, 14, 15) to prioritize actions that move towards state 15. Also, in other areas, I'll choose actions that generally push the agent towards increasing row and column indices, which would guide it towards the goal.

Let me draft a possible params array where each state is mapped to an action that maximizes the chance of moving towards the goal while considering the slippery effect. For example, states closer to the goal might have specific actions like right or down, while others might choose actions that spread out but still trend towards the target.
