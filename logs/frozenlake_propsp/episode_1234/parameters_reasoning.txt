You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get from any starting point to state 15, which gives a reward of +1, and avoid the holes. The tricky part is that the environment is slippery, meaning each action has three possible outcomes with equal probability.

First, I need to understand the layout. It's a 4x4 grid. States 0-3 are the top row, 4-7 the second, 8-11 the third, and 12-15 the bottom row. The goal is state 15, which is the bottom-right corner.

The policy is an array of 16 numbers (params[0] to params[15]), each representing the action taken in that state. Actions are 0 (down/left/up), 1 (right/down/left), 2 (up/right/down), and 3 (left/up/right). Each action has three possible movements, so the agent can end up anywhere in those directions with equal chance.

From the problem description, some states are holes, which terminate the episode. The trajectories provided show that certain actions lead to falling into these holes or reaching the goal. For example, a trajectory like (0,1) repeated multiple times might be going left from state 0, but since it's slippery, it could end up in other states.

Looking at the top 5 best-performing params, they all have f(params) around 0.35-0.45. The most recent ones are lower, like 0.25 or even 0.10 and 0.00. This suggests that we're not yet near the optimal reward of 1.0, so I should be in "Explorer" mode—trying out new configurations to gather more information.

The trajectories show that some policies get stuck in loops (like repeating the same state) or end up falling into holes. To avoid this, I need to design a policy that directs the agent towards the goal while minimizing the risk of hitting a hole.

I should consider for each state what action would maximize the chance of moving closer to 15 without stepping into known holes. For example, in state 0 (top-left), choosing an action that tends to move down or right might be better. But since it's slippery, I need to pick actions that have a higher probability of leading towards the goal.

Looking at state 15, which is the goal, the policy doesn't matter because once reached, the episode ends. So I can set params[15] to any action, but ideally, it's irrelevant since reaching it stops the process.

For other states, like those near the bottom-right (e.g., 12-14), choosing actions that increase the chance of moving right or down would help reach state 15. But I have to be careful because some movements might lead into holes.

One approach is to create a deterministic policy where each state has a specific action that avoids known holes and pushes towards the goal. Since the environment is slippery, this deterministic approach can't guarantee success every time but increases the probability of reaching the goal.

I should also consider symmetry in actions. For example, action 0 from state 0 allows moving down, left, or up. Moving up from state 0 isn't possible (as it's top row), so maybe it's better to avoid that direction.

Another thing is that some states are more dangerous than others. If I can identify which states have holes, the policy should avoid actions leading into those. But without knowing exactly where the holes are, I need a general approach.

Maybe starting with a simple strategy: for each state, choose the action that has the highest chance of moving towards the goal. For example, in the top row (states 0-3), moving down or right is better. In the bottom row, moving right or up might be safer depending on the hole locations.

I should also look at the recent params and trajectories to see what's worked so far. The most recent param had a reward of 0.35 but got stuck in loops. Maybe varying the actions more could help break out of these cycles.

To maximize information gain, I need to propose a new set of params that are different from previous ones. For example, changing some actions from their current values to explore new paths.

Considering all this, I think setting up a policy where each state's action is chosen to generally move towards the goal while avoiding obvious risky moves could be effective. This might involve selecting right or down actions in the top-left quadrant and adjusting based on the slippery nature.

After considering these factors, I'll propose a new set of params that differ from previous attempts, ensuring we explore new paths without repeating the same mistakes.
