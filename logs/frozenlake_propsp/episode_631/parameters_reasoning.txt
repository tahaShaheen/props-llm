You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out the best possible policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) and avoid holes. Since the agent's movements are slippery, each action leads to one of three possible directions with equal probability.

First, I need to understand how the policy works. Each state from 0 to 15 has a corresponding parameter that determines which action to take when in that state. The actions are mapped as follows:
- Action 0: move down, left, or up
- Action 1: move right, down, or left
- Action 2: move up, right, or down
- Action 3: move left, up, or right

The policy should guide the agent towards state 15 while avoiding any holes. From the provided trajectories and rewards, it seems like current policies aren't performing well—rewards are below 0.30 on average.

Looking at the top-performing params, I notice that some states choose action 2 or 3, which have a higher chance of moving towards the right or down, which is good because state 15 is at the bottom-right. However, the rewards aren't close to the optimal 1.0, indicating there's room for improvement.

In the recent trials, policies with all actions set to 1 (right, down, left) didn't perform well, resulting in low or zero rewards. This suggests that maybe a more balanced approach is needed, where the policy doesn't get stuck moving in circles but instead makes progress towards the goal.

I should consider setting each state's action to encourage movement towards state 15 as much as possible, while avoiding directions that lead into holes. For example:
- States near the top (0-3) should aim to move down or right.
- Middle states (4-7, 8-11) should work their way towards the bottom-right by choosing actions that push them towards higher-numbered states.

I'll try setting most states to action 2 or 3. Action 2 includes up, right, and down, which can help move towards higher states when possible. Action 3 includes left, up, and right—useful for adjusting direction without moving away from the goal.

Let me draft a policy where each state i is set to action 2 if it's in the lower half (8-15) or middle rows, except for the last few columns which might need to move down. For upper states (0-7), setting them to action 1 or 3 could help move towards the bottom-right.

Wait, maybe I should assign actions based on proximity to the goal. States closer to the right and bottom should have a higher chance of moving towards state 15. So perhaps for states in row 2 and 3 (states 8-11 and 12-15), set action 2 or 3, which include right and down movements.

Also, considering the slippery nature, each action choice should have a path that statistically leads towards the goal without falling into holes. Maybe focusing on moving towards state 15 by primarily choosing actions that push towards higher states.

After this reasoning, I'll propose a policy where most states are set to action 2 or 3, ensuring that there's a chance to move right and down towards the goal while avoiding getting stuck in loops.
