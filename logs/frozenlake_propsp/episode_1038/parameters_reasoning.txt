You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

Do NOT output anything else. No explanation, no reasoning, nothing.

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help optimize a policy for the FrozenLake environment. The goal is to find the global optimal policy that maximizes the episodic reward, which should ideally be around 1.0. 

First, let me understand the environment. It's a 4x4 grid where each state represents a cell. The agent can move in four directions, but because of the slippery nature, each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability. Holes are present on some grids, and stepping on them ends the episode without reward.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 actions (0-3) for each state. The challenge is to choose these actions such that the agent efficiently reaches the goal at state 15 while avoiding holes.

Looking at the provided data, the top 5 best-performing policies have average rewards around 0.45 or lower, which suggests there's room for improvement. Most recent policies are performing even worse (like 0.00), so maybe I need to explore more rather than exploit current solutions.

I notice that some trajectories end quickly by falling into holes or reaching the goal, but others loop indefinitely without success. To maximize information gain, I should propose a policy that explores new paths, especially for states where previous policies have failed or not yet succeeded.

Since all previous params are given and I can't repeat them, I need to generate a completely new set of actions. Maybe focusing on moving towards the goal in most cases but also ensuring there's some exploration to avoid getting stuck in loops or falling into holes.

I should assign actions that generally move the agent closer to state 15 while considering possible slippery moves. For example, from state 0 (top-left), moving right might be better since it leads towards higher-numbered states. But I also need to check which actions have lower risks of leading into holes.

After considering all this, I'll propose a new set of params that shifts the agent's direction towards the goal and introduces some variability in movements to explore different paths without repeating previous configurations.
