You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15, which is the bottom right corner. The tricky part is that some grid squares are holes, and the agent needs to explore them by remembering trajectories.

The policy parameters are an array of 16 values, each corresponding to a state from 0 to 15. Each parameter can be 0, 1, 2, or 3. From what I understand, these represent different actions: for example, when at state i (where the state is represented by params[i]), the action taken is determined by params[i]. The possible actions are moving down, left, up, and right.

In a regular policy, each parameter would be set to a fixed value. But since we need an optimized policy that can handle holes, it's better to use some form of exploration, like ε-greedy or random restarts. However, in this case, the parameters are integers 0-3, which might correspond to different action choices.

Looking at the examples provided, most policies end up with f(params) around 0.25 or lower. So, we're likely looking for a policy that can navigate the grid while avoiding the holes and efficiently reach the goal state (15).

I recall from my studies that in such environments, using an ε-greedy approach with a small ε (like 0.1) can balance exploration and exploitation. For each action, you take the best-known action (exploitation) but sometimes explore other options (exploration). Since all actions are equally likely when the agent takes an action without any history in this setup, maybe we need to adjust the parameters to favor certain directions more.

Looking at the examples given, policies where params[0] and params[1] have higher values might be better. For instance, setting params[0] = 2 (move up) or params[1] = 3 (right) could encourage moving towards the exit, which is state 15. Also, ensuring that states with holes are avoided by not taking certain actions when they lead into them.

I should also consider that each state's action choice affects the overall reward. Moving down from a hole might be risky if it sends the agent back to another state without enough reward. So, I need policies where from these states, the optimal action is taken, which would either take the path to the goal or avoid going into holes.

Perhaps using a policy that tries all actions when possible but prioritizes certain ones based on their likelihood of success. For example, if from a hole state, taking the right action (like moving up) could be safer even though it's less rewarding, as there are no other options and avoiding immediate penalties is better in the long run.

Considering all these factors—avoiding holes, exploring efficiently, balancing exploration and exploitation—the optimal policy would likely have higher values for actions that lead towards the goal without revisiting holes. So, setting params[0] to 2 (move up) and params[1] to 3 (right) might be a starting point. Additionally, ensuring that other states are handled appropriately could improve overall performance.
