You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, I'm supposed to help find the global optimal policy for a FrozenLake environment that's 4x4. The agent can move in four directions, but because of the slippery nature, each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability. The goal is state 15, and there are holes that end the episode if stepped on.

First, I need to understand how the policy works. Each params[i] represents the action taken when in state i. Since it's a 4x4 grid, states go from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). The agent gets a reward of +1 upon reaching state 15 and 0 otherwise.

Looking at the top-performing params, most have f(params) around 0.35-0.45. The global optimal should be around 1.0, so there's room for improvement. The trajectories show that some policies get stuck or fall into holes repeatedly.

Since I'm supposed to act as a stateless optimizer, I can't remember previous steps. My goal is to maximize information gain each step by either exploring new strategies (if rewards are low) or tweaking the best ones slightly (if close to optimal).

In the recent params provided, some have very low rewards (like 0.05 and 0.00). This suggests that while some policies are getting decent rewards, others aren't performing well. To maximize information gain, I should propose a new set of params that either explores different strategies or slightly adjusts the best-known ones.

Looking at the top params, they mostly choose actions that move towards the goal but sometimes get stuck in loops. Maybe adjusting certain states to encourage more direct paths or avoiding holes would help.

I notice that state 0 is often action 1 (right) and state 1 is action 3 (left). Maybe changing state 0's action to something else could lead to a different trajectory. Alternatively, perhaps ensuring that the agent avoids getting stuck by choosing actions that prevent revisiting states.

Considering the slippery nature, it's challenging to plan deterministic paths. But if I can find a policy where most paths eventually reach state 15 without hitting holes, that would be optimal.

Given that the current best is around 0.45, which is below 1.0, I should focus on exploring different strategies rather than optimizing existing ones. So, I'll propose a new set of params that changes some actions to see if it can achieve higher rewards or avoid holes more effectively.
