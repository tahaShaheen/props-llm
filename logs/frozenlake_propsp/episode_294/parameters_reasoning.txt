You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I need to figure out the best action-value function for the FrozenLake environment using a policy-based approach with parameterization from [0, 1, 2, 3]. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right corner) and minimize the reward by avoiding holes. 

First, I understand that the parameters are arranged such that each index corresponds to a specific action when on certain grid states. For instance, params[0] is action 0 for state 0, which is moving down from where? Wait, let me clarify.

The policy array has one element per state (16 elements in total). Each element represents the chosen action when on that state. The actions are 0 (down), 1 (left), 2 (up), and 3 (right).

The reward structure is such that all non-goal states give 0, but the goal state gives a +1 reward. However, there's a problem where some grid positions are holes (state 6 or maybe other high-numbered states?), which will end the episode if the agent steps on them.

The key here is to find parameters that guide the agent through these holes without falling into them. Since the policy can't hit holes because they end the game, we need a robust exploration strategy. But since we're using parameterization, perhaps some parameters are stuck, making it hard for the agent to explore the environment properly.

Looking at the top-performing params from the examples provided:

1. params[0]: 2 (action 2 is up)
   params[1]: 3 (action 3 right)
   others set to 1 or 0.
   This seems to guide towards action up, which might be useful if the environment's structure allows for exploration.

Another param set where all are 2 except one: 

params[0]: 2; params[1]: 3; ... which is similar to another param set. It results in a reward of 0.25 or 0.3, suggesting that having consistent action 2 (up) might be better if the structure allows for exploration without too much interference.

I should consider that some parameters may not allow for sufficient exploration around problematic states, leading to stuck policies and low rewards. Perhaps by varying certain parameters more, the agent can explore these areas and avoid getting trapped.

But considering the reward examples, even with varied parameters, the maximum f(params) is 0.35, which isn't very high. So maybe a better parameter set from one of the top performing params sets would yield higher rewards, but I need to see if that's possible without hitting holes.

Another approach: since each state has a specific action assigned, the parameters are fixed per state. Maybe there's an optimal combination where for certain states, different actions are preferred. For instance, when on some states (like state 6), avoiding falling into them is crucial, so perhaps adjusting params for those states could help.

Alternatively, maybe by increasing parameters that encourage up movements from problematic areas can prevent the agent from being stuck there. But this needs to be balanced with other directions to explore the grid adequately and collect rewards.

Given all this, I think experimenting with different parameter combinations around 1 or 2 might yield better results than sticking with higher numbers like 0 or 3. Since some of the top-performing sets use 2, which is up, that could be a sign of exploration. However, if hitting holes isn't feasible because it ends the game, maybe other parameters need to guide movement away from problematic areas more effectively.

In conclusion, I'll try parameter values around 1 or 2 and see how they perform on subsequent iterations without getting stuck in the holes.
