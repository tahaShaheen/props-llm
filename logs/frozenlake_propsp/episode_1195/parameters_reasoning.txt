You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The environment is a 4x4 grid where each state (0-15) represents a cell. The goal is to reach state 15, which gives a reward of +1. All other states give 0. But there are holes that end the episode if stepped on. The slippery nature means actions don't always lead directly to the intended next state; instead, they have a 1/3 chance to move in one of three possible directions.

The policy is defined by an array 'params' where each element corresponds to the action taken from that state (0-3). My task is to propose different 'params' configurations over iterations to maximize the reward. The user mentioned that the optimal reward should be around 1.0, which suggests a deterministic path to the goal without falling into holes.

Looking at the history provided, the top params have average rewards of about 0.45-0.35, which is below the target. This indicates we're still exploring and haven't found an optimal policy yet. The recent attempts are getting even lower rewards (0.00), so maybe they fell into holes.

The key here is to avoid holes while moving towards state 15. So I need to figure out safe paths from each state, avoiding the holes. Let me think about possible strategies:

1. **Identify Holes:** Since the user didn't specify which states are holes, I have to infer them based on failed trajectories. From the recent attempts, certain actions led to falling into holes or looping without reaching the goal.

2. **Explore Safe Paths:** For each state, choose an action that maximizes the chance of moving closer to 15 while avoiding known dangerous paths.

3. **Maximize Information Gain:** Since I'm stateless, each suggestion should aim to provide new information about which actions lead to success or failure.

In the recent attempts, policies that went through states like 2,6,9, etc., resulted in falling into holes or getting stuck. So perhaps adjusting these states' actions could help.

Let me consider a possible optimal path: from state 0 (top-left), move right to reach the goal more directly. But due to the slippery nature, moving right might not always work. Alternatively, moving down towards state 4 and then proceeding right or down.

Looking at the best-performing params in the top list, they seem to oscillate between certain actions, but perhaps they're not taking the most direct path or are getting stuck in loops.

I need to propose a new 'params' configuration that hasn't been tried before. Let me consider changing some of the critical states:

- From state 0 (top-left), maybe action 2 (which could move up, right, or down). But since moving up is out of bounds, it might not be ideal.
- Alternatively, action 1 from state 0 which can move right, down, or left. Left would take it back, so perhaps right is better.

Wait, in the top params, action 1 was used for state 0, leading to some progress but not all the way. Maybe tweaking other states could help.

Another approach: Let's try setting a path that moves directly towards the goal by always moving right and down when possible. For example:

- From state 0 (0,0): move right (action 1) to get to 1.
- From state 1 (0,1): move down (action maybe 2 or 3) but need to see the action's effect.

Wait, each action from a state has three possible outcomes. So I have to choose actions that when taken, their possible next states are either safe or towards the goal.

Alternatively, perhaps using a greedy approach where each action is chosen to maximize the probability of reaching the goal in the fewest steps without falling into holes.

Given the complexity and the need to avoid repetition, I'll propose a new 'params' configuration that slightly varies from the top-performing ones but hasn't been tried yet. For example:

Change some of the states along the middle row (4-7) to take different actions to avoid loops and move closer to the goal.

Let me outline a tentative plan for some states:

- State 0: action 1 (right)
- State 1: action 3 (which could lead to right, up, or left. Up is invalid, so might go right or down.
- State 4: perhaps action 2 (down) to move towards the bottom row.

But without knowing the exact hole positions, it's tricky. So instead, I'll aim for a policy that tries to head towards state 15 by moving right and down, while avoiding states that have led to failures in previous attempts.

Considering all this, here's a new 'params' configuration that hasn't been tried before:

params[0]: 2, params[1]: 3, params[2]: 1, params[3]: 2, params[4]: 1, params[5]: 3, params[6]: 1, params[7]: 3, params[8]: 2, params[9]: 0, params[10]: 3, params[11]: 2, params[12]: 0, params[13]: 2, params[14]: 3, params[15]: 3
