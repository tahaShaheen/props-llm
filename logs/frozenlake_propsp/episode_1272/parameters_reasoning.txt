You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to propose the next set of parameters for the FrozenLake environment to optimize the policy and get closer to the global optimal reward of around 1.0. Let's break this down step by step.

First, understanding the environment: it's a 4x4 grid with state numbers from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). The goal is to reach state 15 for a reward of +1. The environment is slippery, meaning each action taken has a 33% chance to move in one of three directions. There are also holes that end the episode if stepped on.

The policy is defined by an array 'params' where each element corresponds to a state (0-15) and determines which action (0-3) to take when in that state. The challenge is to find the optimal set of actions across all states that maximizes the average reward over multiple episodes.

Looking at the provided data, the top 5 best-performing policies have an average reward around 0.45, which is significantly below the target of 1.0. This suggests that while these policies are better than others, they're still not optimal. The recent attempts show even lower rewards, some as low as 0.00, indicating that perhaps the current strategies aren't leading towards the goal efficiently.

Given that the environment is stateless and I can't remember previous steps, my approach must focus on maximizing information gain each time. Since the rewards are still below 1.0, I should act more like an explorer—trying out new configurations distinct from what's been tried before to uncover better strategies.

I need to consider which states might be leading towards or away from the goal and adjust their actions accordingly. For example, states near the bottom-right (like 12, 13, 14, 15) should ideally move towards 15 without falling into holes. Maybe in state 14, taking action 0 (which could move down or left or up) might not be optimal. Perhaps a different action would push it closer to 15.

Looking at the most recent attempts, some trajectories end quickly or get stuck in loops. For example, one trajectory went from 0 to 3 repeatedly without making progress. This indicates that the policy for states near the top-left isn't encouraging movement towards the goal.

I should focus on modifying actions for key states like 8 (top of the third row), which is crucial for moving down towards the bottom-right. Maybe setting params[8] to a different action could help move towards state 12, and from there closer to 15.

Another consideration is avoiding holes. If certain states are known to have high risks of falling into holes based on previous trajectories, adjusting their actions to avoid those directions would be beneficial. For example, if moving left from state 9 often leads to a hole, setting params[9] to an action that doesn't go left (like 0, which moves down) might help.

I also notice that in the top-performing policies, some states have action 1 or 3, which might be causing lateral movements. Maybe switching these to more goal-oriented actions like right (action 2) or down (action 0) could push the agent closer to the target.

Since I'm acting as an explorer now, I should choose a params configuration that hasn't been tried before and addresses these issues. For instance, setting certain states near the top-left to move more towards the right or down instead of left or up could help in making progress towards the goal.

After considering all this, I'll propose a new set of parameters where key states are adjusted to push towards the bottom-right while avoiding risky moves that lead into holes. This should provide new information and potentially improve the reward.
