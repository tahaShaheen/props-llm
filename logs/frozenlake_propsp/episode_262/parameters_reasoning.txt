You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to help the user with their FrozenLake environment problem. They want me to find the best policy parameters using an epsilon-greedy approach or something similar because the grid is slippery.

First, let's understand the setup. The environment is a 4x4 grid where each cell can be moved in four directions—left, down, right, up—but with some probabilities. When taking an action, the agent doesn't always get the intended direction due to the slippery condition.

The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) by maximizing rewards. All other states give a reward of 0. The policy parameters are an array where each index represents a state, and the value at that index is the action taken from that state.

The policy should aim for the global optimal path, which is known in this environment—moving directly up or down towards the goal. However, because the grid is slippery, sometimes the agent might take random actions to explore different paths.

Looking at the examples provided, several parameter sets are highlighted as performing well. The most recent ones include parameters that encourage more exploratory moves (likeparams[0] and params[1] being 2) which correspond to moving up or down more often, avoiding getting stuck in holes. But these also have higher discount factors (params[3], etc.) which may not be optimal.

The goal is to choose values for the parameters array that maximize the episodic reward without prematurely converging on a local optimum. Since the policy's reward depends heavily on exploration and exploitation, it might benefit from an epsilon-greedy approach where 'epsilon' represents the probability of exploring versus exploiting.

Considering all the examples, some have params[0] as 2 (up) most of the time but occasionally explore by taking other actions like 1 (down). Similarly, params[1] being 3 means that when in certain positions, the agent takes a different action, which might help escape local minima.

To balance exploration and exploitation, perhaps setting an epsilon value around 0.2-0.3 could work. This would mean taking actions based on the current policy (exploration) or randomly exploring with probability epsilon. Excluding any previously seen params ensures we don't repeat our own trials, promoting discovery of better strategies.

Testing this approach might help find a set where the agent explores more in some areas while sticking to the optimal path in others, leading to higher rewards without getting stuck.
