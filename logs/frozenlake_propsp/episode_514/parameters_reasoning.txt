You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get the agent to state 15 with as high a reward as possible, avoiding holes. From the problem description, I know that each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability due to the slippery nature of the environment.

First, I need to understand the layout and where the holes are because the policy needs to avoid them. The user mentioned that some states are holes, but they didn't specify which ones. So, my strategy is to design a policy that tries to move towards state 15 while avoiding areas likely to have holes.

Looking at the example policies provided, most of them have low rewards (around 0.2 to 0.3). The top-performing one had 0.30, which is still far from the optimal 1.0. This suggests that the current policies aren't effectively navigating towards the goal or are falling into holes often.

Since the environment is 4x4, state 15 is the bottom-right corner. To reach there, the agent needs to move right and down as much as possible. However, because of the slippery nature, each action can lead in three directions. So, I need a policy that guides the agent towards the goal without taking unnecessary risks.

Let me think about how each state should behave:

- State 0 is (0,0). From here, moving right or down could be good. But since actions are probabilistic, maybe choosing an action that has a higher chance of moving towards the right or down.
- For states closer to the goal, like state 12, 13, 14, and 15, the agent should try to move right or down (depending on position) to reach 15.

Wait, but since actions are slippery, I need to make sure that each action leads towards the goal as much as possible. For example, in state 0, choosing action 0 might lead the agent to move down, left, or up, which isn't ideal because moving left would take it into a hole (if any). So maybe selecting actions that have higher probabilities of moving right.

Looking at the action definitions:
- Action 0: [down, left, up]
- Action 1: [right, down, left]
- Action 2: [up, right, down]
- Action 3: [left, up, right]

To move towards the goal (state 15), in states where moving right is possible, we should choose actions that have a higher chance of moving right. For example:

- In state 0 (top-left corner), to move right or down, action 1 might be better because it includes right as one option.
- Similarly, for other states near the top and left edges, choosing actions that include movement towards the goal.

I also notice that some policies have low rewards because they either fall into holes or take too long. To avoid holes, the policy should prefer actions that don't lead to hole states based on previous trajectories.

Looking at the recent policies provided, many seem to get stuck or loop without reaching the goal. So, perhaps the current policies aren't effectively navigating towards state 15 and are getting stuck in cycles or falling into holes.

To improve this, I need a policy that, for each state, selects an action that maximizes the chance of moving towards the goal while avoiding holes. Given that actions are probabilistic, it's about selecting actions that have the highest probability of leading to safe, goal-oriented moves.

Let me consider creating a deterministic policy where each state is mapped to the best possible action, considering the slippery nature and the need to reach state 15.

For example:
- States in row 0 (top row) should try to move right as much as possible.
- States in column 3 (rightmost column) should try to move down towards the goal.
- Avoiding states that are likely holes by not moving into them, based on previous trajectories.

I also need to ensure that each action selection doesn't repeat previous policies to explore new possibilities. Since I'm a stateless optimizer, I can't remember past policies, so I have to generate each policy from scratch, ensuring it's different from previously tried ones.

Given the current top policies, perhaps adjusting the actions in critical states could lead to better performance. For example, changing some of the action selections from 3 to 2 or 1 might help avoid holes and move more effectively towards the goal.

Another approach is to have a policy that tends to push the agent towards the right and down directions by choosing actions that include these movements in their possible outcomes. For instance:

- Action 1 (right, down, left) can be used on states where moving right or down is beneficial.
- Action 2 (up, right, down) can also help move towards the goal from certain positions.

By systematically selecting actions that have a higher chance of moving in the desired direction, I might improve the agent's ability to reach state 15 without falling into holes.

Now, considering all this, I'll construct a new policy where each state is assigned an action that best guides the agent towards the goal while avoiding known dangerous areas. This involves checking for each state which actions would increase the chances of moving closer to state 15 and not stepping on holes.
