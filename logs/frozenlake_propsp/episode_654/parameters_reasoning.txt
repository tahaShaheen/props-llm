You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. It's a 4x4 grid where the agent can move in four directions, but due to slipperiness, each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability. The goal is state 15, which gives +1 reward, and there are holes that end the episode if stepped on.

The policy is an array of 16 numbers, each representing the action for states 0 through 15. My task is to propose a new set of params in each iteration, trying to maximize the average episodic reward.

Looking at the top 4 best performing params, they all have rewards around 0.2-0.35, which is below the target of 1.0. So I'm probably not close enough yet. The recent attempts aren't doing well either, with some having zero reward and a couple around 0.05.

Since the current best isn't great, I should focus on exploration. Maybe some states are leading into holes or getting stuck in loops. I need to change actions in key positions to avoid those issues and find better paths.

I notice that the top params have varied actions, but maybe certain states are still problematic. For example, state 0 (top-left corner) might be choosing action 1 or 2 previously. Maybe trying a different action here could help reach new areas without falling into holes.

Let me think about each state:

- State 0: Current best is 1 and 2. What if I try action 3? It moves left, down, up. But since it's the corner, moving left or up would be out of bounds, but in this environment, I suppose those moves might still count as staying put or looping? Or perhaps the slippery nature allows it to move to other states.

Wait, no—each action when at an edge state probably leads to different possible next states. For example, if in state 0 (top-left), taking action 1 would try to go right, down, left, but since it's on the edge, perhaps some moves are invalid, leading to a different set of possible states.

I need to make sure that the policy avoids holes and navigates towards the goal. Perhaps I should adjust the actions for states near the holes or key points like state 14 (which is one step away from the goal).

Looking at recent params, some have high rewards but others are failing. Maybe focusing on states that often lead to failure could help. For example, state 0 leading directly into a hole when taking certain actions.

Alternatively, perhaps the current policies aren't effectively navigating towards the goal because they're stuck in loops or avoiding holes too much. I need a policy that balances exploration and exploitation but moves more confidently towards the goal.

I think changing some key states might help. For instance:

- State 0: Maybe try action 3 instead of 1 or 2.
- States near the goal (like 14) should take actions directly leading to 15, like right or up/down depending on position.

But without knowing which specific states are holes, I have to infer based on previous trajectories. The provided examples show that certain paths lead to termination, so perhaps those states need different actions.

I'll propose a new set of params where:

- For state 0, try action 3.
- For state 1, maybe action 2 or 3.
- Ensure states in the bottom row take actions leading towards 15.
- Adjust other states to avoid loops and increase chances of reaching the goal.

I'll create a new params array that varies several key states to explore different paths and see if it improves the reward.
