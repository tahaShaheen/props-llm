You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment using a reinforcement learning approach. The environment is slippery, meaning each action has some probability of leading in any direction, which complicates things. The goal is to reach state 15 (right bottom) and get +1 reward from there. All other states give zero reward.

The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers, where each number corresponds to the action for a specific state (0 to 15). Each action is 0-3, representing left, down, right, up. The values provided in the training examples seem to be from this policy array.

First, I need to understand how the policy affects the agent's behavior. If multiple params are close, it might mean that the agent is exploring nearby states randomly. But since the problem mentions using previous trajectories, perhaps the best approach is to explore recent high-reward paths or patterns in the data provided.

Looking at the provided examples of params and their corresponding f(params), some params have very similar values, which might indicate they're following a repetitive pattern. For instance, the example where all params are either 2 or 3 seems like it's avoiding the slippery areas or moving in certain directions consistently, leading to higher rewards.

Another point is that some examples have lower rewards (0.05 or below), suggesting that these policies might not be optimal yet. To find the global optimum, I should look for params that yield the highest f(params). The user mentioned that if a parameter is below 1, it's likely an optimal policy, but this isn't necessarily true; some lower values might still lead to high rewards due to efficient exploration.

I need to analyze the examples. For instance, the example with params[0]:2, params[1]:3, params[2]:1... seems like a consistent pattern of taking action 3 sometimes and 1 others. This could correspond to moving right or down but avoiding some slippery areas.

The most recent example at iteration 148 has f(params) = 0.05, which is quite low. That suggests that this policy isn't performing well yet. So I should continue exploring and perhaps look for policies where the actions are more evenly distributed or follow a clear pattern that leads to higher rewards.

I think the key here is to use these examples as guides. The best recent example has some high reward paths, like taking action 3 and sometimes action 1. This indicates that in those cases, the agent might be moving towards specific states without falling into holes (since reward is zero except for state 15). So perhaps the optimal policy avoids stepping on slippery tiles by choosing actions that are more predictable or avoid the slippery areas.

Therefore, I should focus on policies that either follow a clear cycle or pattern seen in the high-reward examples. For example, if a parameter set has consistent left and right movements around certain states without taking action 1 often (as per some examples), it might be a good candidate for optimal performance.
