You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out how to propose the next set of parameters for the FrozenLake environment. The goal is to maximize the reward by reaching state 15 without falling into any holes. 

First, I need to understand the problem structure. The grid is 4x4 with states numbered from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). The slippery nature means each action has a 33% chance of moving in one of three directions, making it stochastic.

From the given examples and trajectories, I can see that many policies are getting stuck or falling into holes. For instance, some trajectories show loops where the agent keeps moving between states without progressing towards the goal.

I notice that the highest reward so far is 0.45, which is still below the target of 1.0. This suggests we need to explore more effectively or adjust our strategy to avoid holes.

Looking at the recent policies and their trajectories, I see several patterns:

1. Policies often get stuck near state 8 (third row, first column). For example, in one trajectory, the agent moves from 4 to 8, then gets stuck moving down, left, or up without making progress.
2. Some policies tend to loop between states, like going from 0 to 1 and back multiple times before trying other directions.

To improve, I should design a policy that encourages exploration towards state 15 while avoiding known holes. Since we don't have information about where the holes are exactly, the policy must be robust against possible detours.

One approach is to set actions that generally move towards the goal (right and down) but also include some variability to handle the stochastic nature. For example, from state 0 (top-left), moving right or down could help progress. Similarly, in other states, choosing actions that have a higher probability of moving closer to the goal.

I'll go through each state and decide the optimal action based on its position:

- States near the top row should prefer moving down.
- States near the leftmost column should prefer moving right.
- Ensure that from each state, there's a path towards 15 without high risk of falling into holes.

Considering this, I'll propose a new set of parameters where most states encourage movement towards the goal, with some diversity in actions to handle the slipperiness and avoid loops.
