You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 1314 out of 5000. OUTPUT ONLY THIS SINGLE LINE:

Do NOT output anything else. No explanation, no reasoning, nothing.



LLM:
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out the best parameters for the FrozenLake environment based on the information provided. The goal is to maximize the reward by reaching state 15, avoiding holes. 

Looking at the examples given, most of the top params have an average reward around 0.45, which is significantly below the target of 1.0. This suggests that we're in the exploration phase since the rewards aren't close to optimal yet.

The recent parameters provided all resulted in very low or zero rewards. That means these configurations are either leading the agent into holes quickly or not reaching the goal efficiently. To maximize information gain, I should propose a new set of parameters that haven't been tried before and could potentially explore different paths.

I need to make sure each state's action is chosen such that it avoids holes as much as possible. For example, in states near the edges, certain actions might lead into holes with high probability, so those actions should be avoided.

Let me consider a few key points:

1. **Start State (0)**: The agent is at the top-left corner. Possible moves are down, left, or up (since action 0 has these options). But moving left would take it to state -1, which isn't valid, so it's better to go right or down.

2. **Holes**: I need to identify which states are holes based on the trajectories provided. From the recent attempts, stepping into certain states leads to termination, indicating they're holes.

3. **Exploration vs Exploitation**: Since current rewards are low, focusing on exploration is better. So, choosing actions that might lead to unexplored areas could help find a better path.

I think I should design the policy to move towards the goal (state 15) while avoiding known dangerous states. For instance, in state 0, moving right (action 1 or action 3) might be safer. Similarly, in other states, choosing actions that push the agent closer to the goal without stepping into holes.

Looking at previous params, most have action 1 for some states. Maybe varying this could help. I'll try setting different actions for certain key states to see if it leads to a better trajectory.
