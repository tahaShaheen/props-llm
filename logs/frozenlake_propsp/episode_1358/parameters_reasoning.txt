You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get an episodic reward of around 1.0 by reaching state 15 without falling into any holes. From the examples provided, it looks like the best policies are achieving about 0.45, which isn't great yet.

First, I need to understand how the agent moves and where the holes are. Since it's a 4x4 grid, each state corresponds to a specific cell. The slippery nature means that taking an action can lead to three possible directions with equal probability. This makes planning tricky because there's uncertainty in the movement outcomes.

Looking at the top-performing policies, they seem to be using actions that move towards the goal but sometimes get stuck or fall into loops. For instance, some trajectories show repeated states, which probably leads to lower rewards. I need a policy that avoids such loops and efficiently navigates toward state 15.

The recent attempts include various combinations of actions. Some are getting zero rewards, which likely means they fell into holes immediately. Others have moderate rewards but aren't reaching the goal consistently. To improve, maybe focusing on policies that can reach the goal more directly would help.

Considering the slipperiness, it's essential to choose actions that have a higher probability of moving towards the goal despite the randomness. For example, moving right and down are crucial for reaching state 15 from the top-left corner (state 0). However, due to the slippery nature, I need to ensure that each action choice doesn't lead into a hole with high probability.

I should look at the current best policies and see if tweaking certain actions can lead to better performance. For instance, in state 0, using action 1 (which moves right, down, or left) might help move towards state 1. Similarly, in other states, choosing actions that push towards the goal while avoiding risky moves.

I think I'll start by modifying some of the recent policies that had moderate success but didn't reach the goal. Maybe changing a few key action choices in critical states can nudge the agent closer to the goal and avoid holes more effectively. Also, ensuring that from each state, there's a path that doesn't lead into any hole with high probability is crucial.

After considering these factors, I'll propose a new set of parameters where each state's action is selected to balance between moving towards the goal and avoiding dangerous moves based on the known hole locations.
