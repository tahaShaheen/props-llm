You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward by reaching state 15. From what I understand, each action taken by the agent doesn't always lead directly to where it intends because of the slippery nature of the environment. Each action has a 33% chance to go in three different directions.

First, I need to figure out which states are holes and which aren't. The user mentioned that there are holes but didn't specify their locations. However, from the trajectories provided, I can infer some information. For example, if an agent steps into a state and immediately falls into a hole, that must be a hole.

Looking at the most recent parameters and their rewards:

1. The first most recent parameter had a reward of 0.00 with the trajectory: (0,2) → (4,1) → (8,1) → (9,3) → (8,1) → (9,3). It ended because it fell into a hole or reached the goal? Since the reward is 0, I think it fell into a hole. So state 9 might be a hole.

2. Another recent parameter had a reward of 0.10 with the trajectory: (0,0) → (0,0) → ... → (4,3). This suggests that reaching state 4 is safe but doesn't lead to the goal yet.

3. The third recent parameter also had 0.10, ending in (4,1), which might be a hole or not. Since the reward is low, maybe state 4 is leading towards a dead end.

I need to make sure that the policy avoids holes. So, I should adjust the parameters to ensure that when the agent takes an action from a particular state, it doesn't have any chance of stepping into a hole.

In the previous steps, some parameters tried different actions but didn't achieve high rewards. For example, in params[0], setting action 2 or 1 seems common. Maybe I should try other actions to see if they lead to better paths.

Looking at state 0: it's the top-left corner (0,0). The possible moves from here are down, right, and maybe up? Wait, according to the environment description, when taking action 0, the agent can move down, left, or up. So in state 0, moving up would stay in the same row but might not be allowed because it's at the top.

Wait no: The grid is 4x4, so rows go from 0 (top) to 3 (bottom). Columns go from 0 (left) to 3 (right). So state 0 is (0,0), action 0 could move down, left, or up. But moving up from row 0 would probably stay in the same position or maybe wrap around? No, in FrozenLake, I think it stays put if moving out of bounds.

Wait, actually, no. In standard FrozenLake, moving into a wall doesn't change the state, but this environment is slippery with 3 possible moves each time.

Hmm, perhaps from state 0 (top-left), action 0 leads to down, left, or up. But since it's at row 0, moving up would stay in the same place? Or maybe it can move right if that's one of the options.

Wait no: The description says for each action, the agent picks from specific directions. For example, action 0 gives [down, left, up]. So from state 0 (row 0, column 0), moving up would try to go to row -1, which is invalid. So perhaps in such cases, it just stays in place? Or maybe the movement is adjusted.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, when you take an action, you have a 33% chance of each direction in the specified set for that action. So if moving up from state 0 (row 0) would lead to row -1, which isn't valid, does it stay put? Or perhaps wrap around?

I think in most grid-based environments, moving beyond the grid boundaries results in staying in place or reflecting. But since the problem doesn't specify, I might have to assume that invalid moves are not possible and only allowed directions are considered.

Wait no, actually, the environment is slippery, so when you take an action, it's one of three directions regardless of the position. So from state 0 (row 0), if you choose action 0 (down, left, up), moving up would still be a possible direction, but since it can't go beyond row -1, perhaps that move is impossible and thus not considered? Or does it get treated as staying in place?

This is a bit confusing. Maybe I should look at the trajectories provided to infer.

Looking back at one of the top-performing parameters: 

params[0]: 1; params[1]:3; etc., with f(params)=0.45. The trajectory was (0,2) → (0,2) → (0,2) → (4,2). So from state 0, action 2 was taken. Action 2's possible moves are [up, right, down]. From row 0, column 0: up would be invalid, so does it choose between right and down? Or is the movement attempted regardless of boundaries?

In this case, moving up (action 2) from state 0 might not change the state because it's at the top. So in that trajectory, taking action 2 three times kept the agent in state 0 until it somehow moved to state 4.

Wait, but how did it get to state 4? From state 0, moving down (action 0 or action 1?) leads to row 1, which is state 4. So perhaps from state 0, action 2's possible moves are right and down because up isn't allowed. Therefore, when action 2 is taken from state 0, the agent has a 33% chance each of moving right or down (since up isn't an option), but since it's three directions, maybe one of them can't be done, so perhaps two valid moves and one invalid.

Wait, this might complicate things. Maybe I should focus on making sure that from each state, the action chosen doesn't have any possibility of falling into a hole, based on previous trajectories.

From the recent data, state 9 seems to be a hole because in the first most recent parameter, after moving to state 9, it fell into a hole (reward 0). So I should ensure that from state 8 and other states leading towards 9, the action chosen doesn't have a chance of going to state 9.

Similarly, looking at another trajectory: (0,1) → (4,2) etc., so from state 1, taking action 2 leads to state 4. That might be safe since it didn't result in a hole immediately.

Another thing I notice is that the highest reward achieved so far is 0.45, which is much lower than the target of 1.0. So there's room for improvement.

I think the optimal policy should guide the agent towards state 15 without falling into any holes. To do this, each action in the policy must ensure that none of the possible next states are holes. Also, the path should be as direct as possible to reach the goal.

Looking at the grid:

- State 0 is (0,0)
- State 4 is (1,0)
- State 8 is (2,0)
- State 12 is (3,0) – bottom-left
- State 15 is (3,3) – goal

So to reach the goal from state 0, the agent needs to move right or down. But due to the slippery nature, each action has a chance of moving in three directions.

I think a good strategy would be to have states near the bottom and right encourage movement towards the goal, while avoiding holes.

Given that, I should try setting parameters for each state such that the actions chosen increase the likelihood of reaching the goal without stepping into known or inferred holes.

For example:

- From state 0 (top-left), moving down (action 0) might lead to state 4. But if action 2 is taken, it could move right to state 1. However, in some cases, agents have gotten stuck oscillating between states without progress.

Maybe a better approach is to always push towards the goal as much as possible. So from each state, choose actions that tend to move right or down, depending on where they are.

But considering the slippery nature, it's tricky because each action can lead in three directions.

Perhaps setting all states to prefer moving right and down when possible would be better.

Looking at specific states:

- State 0: Can move down (to state 4), left (stays?), or up (stays?). If we set the action to 2, which allows moving right or down. So from 0, taking action 2 gives a chance to go right to state 1 or down to state 4.

- State 1: From here, possible actions should move towards the goal. For example, action 3 could allow moving left, up, or right. Moving right would take it closer to the goal in columns.

Wait, but each action has a set of possible moves:

Action 0: down, left, up

Action 1: right, down, left

Action 2: up, right, down

Action 3: left, up, right

So from state 1 (row 0, column 1), taking action 1 would have a chance to move right (to state 2) or down (state 5) or left (back to state 0).

But since the goal is to the bottom-right, moving towards higher row and column numbers is better.

So for state 1, perhaps choosing action 1 or 3 would be good as they include right movements.

Similarly, from state 4 (row 1, column 0), taking action 2 allows moving up, right, down. Moving right to state 5 or down to state 8.

I think the optimal policy should guide towards the goal while avoiding holes. Since I don't have all hole information, but inferred that state 9 is a hole, I can adjust parameters accordingly.

For example, from state 8 (row 2, column 0), taking action 3 would move left (invalid, stays?), up (to state 4), or right (state 9). Since state 9 is a hole, to avoid it, the agent should not take an action that can lead to state 9.

So from state 8, if we choose action 0 (down, left, up), moving down would go to row 3 (state 12), left might stay, and up goes back to row 1 (state 4). Alternatively, choosing action 3 could be risky because of state 9.

Thus, perhaps from state 8, taking action 0 is better as it doesn't risk moving right into state 9.

Putting this together, I can start setting the parameters for each state to encourage movement towards the goal while avoiding holes. For instance:

- State 0: choose action that allows moving down or right
- State 1: choose actions with right or down
- ...
- State 8: avoid actions leading to state 9

But since I can't remember previous attempts, I need to propose a new set of params that hasn't been tried before and maximizes information gain.

Looking at the recent parameters provided, most have certain patterns. To be exploratory, perhaps change several states' actions to see their effects.

For example:

- Set state 0's action to 2 (up, right, down) – but up might not work.
- Set state 1's action to 3 (left, up, right)
- Continue this for other states, ensuring they don't lead into known holes and push towards the goal.

Alternatively, maybe setting all even-numbered states to move right and odd-numbered states to move down or something like that. But I need to structure it properly.

After considering all these factors, I'll propose a new set of params where each state is assigned an action that tends to move towards the goal while avoiding known holes.
