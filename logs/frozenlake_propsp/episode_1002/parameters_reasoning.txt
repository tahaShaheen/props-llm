You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Alright, let's break down how I arrived at the proposed parameters for the FrozenLake environment. The goal is to find a policy that maximizes the episodic reward, ideally reaching close to 1.0, which means successfully reaching state 15 without falling into any holes.

First, I considered the structure of the environment. It's a 4x4 grid where each state corresponds to a specific cell. The slippery nature of the environment adds complexity because each action doesn't directly lead to the intended next state but instead has an equal probability of moving in three directions.

I looked at the provided top-performing parameters and their trajectories. Most had reward values around 0.35-0.45, which are significantly below the target of 1.0. This suggests that the current policies aren't effectively navigating to the goal without falling into holes or getting stuck in loops.

Given that the rewards are far from optimal, my strategy shifts towards exploration rather than exploitation. The aim is to test new parameters that haven't been tried before to uncover better-performing strategies.

I decided to modify key states' actions to encourage movement towards state 15 while avoiding holes. For instance:

- **State 0 (top-left corner)**: Choosing action 3 (which allows moving right, up, or left) might help in exploring different paths.
- **States along the top row (0,1; 0,2; etc.)**: Encouraging movement down to progress towards the goal.
- **States near the bottom-right (e.g., state 14)**: Choosing actions that push towards state 15.

I also considered avoiding loops by changing certain states' actions. For example, in state 7, instead of moving right or up, choosing action 3 might help in steering towards the goal without getting stuck.

By making these changes, I aimed to create a policy that explores new paths and avoids previously ineffective strategies, setting the stage for potentially higher rewards in subsequent iterations.
