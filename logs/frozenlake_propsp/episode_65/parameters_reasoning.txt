You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to find the global optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment using a reinforcement learning approach. The goal is to reach state 15 with the highest reward possible. 

First, I need to understand the problem setup. The agent operates in a 4x4 grid where each state is represented by an index from 0 to 15. The states are arranged such that 0 is top-left, 3 is top-right, 7 is bottom-right, and 12 is bottom-left. The agent can move up, down, left, or right. However, the environment is slippery, meaning each action has a certain probability of choosing one of the other actions. This increases uncertainty in the transitions between states.

The policy is defined by an array of parameters where each element represents the probability of taking a specific action from that state. The current parameters are initialized as [1.0 for all], and I need to find the optimal values from [0, 1, 2, 3].

I'm thinking about the approach here. Since this is a reinforcement learning problem, an off-policy algorithm like Q-Learning or SARSA might be suitable. But given that the agent's actions are influenced by history (the policy explores new states), I might need to use a combination of techniques. However, considering the deterministic nature and the state transitions, perhaps a simple policy gradient method would work well.

I recall that when using policy gradients like REINFORCE or GD-Actor, we can adjust the parameters based on the gradient of the expected reward. Each parameter's update is proportional to the average return minus its current action, multiplied by the probability distribution over actions from the current state.

Given that the reward function assigns 0 for all states except state 15 (which gives +1), the optimal policy should aim to maximize the chances of reaching state 15. Since the environment is slippery, the agent has uncertainty in choosing actions, so it's crucial to balance exploration and exploitation.

I think I'll use a simple iterative approach where at each iteration, the policy parameters are updated based on the average reward from that state under the current policy. The update would adjust the probability distribution of each action towards higher rewards.

Starting with all parameters as 1.0, any initial exploration will be random. Over time, as the agent explores different states and transitions, it should gradually focus on reaching the goal state more efficiently.

I need to ensure that in each iteration, I evaluate the policy's expected reward by simulating a trajectory of experiences from that policy. Then, adjust the parameters accordingly. This process is repeated until convergence or a sufficient number of iterations are reached without further improvement.

Considering the slippery nature, the agent might prefer actions that lead it closer to the goal despite having lower immediate rewards. However, since all other states except 15 give 0 reward, the main focus will be on efficiently navigating from any state to state 15 without getting stuck in local optima.

In summary, I'll simulate the policy's behavior at each iteration, calculate the expected reward for each state using that policy, and update the parameters accordingly. This should help the agent learn a better policy over time.
