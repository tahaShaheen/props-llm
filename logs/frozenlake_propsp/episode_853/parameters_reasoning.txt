You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I need to help find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, understanding the environment: It's a 4x4 grid with states numbered from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). The goal is state 15, which gives +1 reward, and all other states give 0. However, there are holes that end the episode if stepped on.

The policy is an array of 16 elements, each representing the action taken in each state. Actions can be 0,1,2,3. The environment is slippery, meaning each action leads to one of three possible moves with equal probability.

From the user's message, I see that the top 5 best params have f(params) around 0.45, and recent ones are lower, some even 0.00 or 0.05. The goal is to reach as close to 1.0 as possible.

Since we're at iteration 853, there's still a lot of room for exploration. But the user mentioned that if rewards are below 1.0, I should act as an Explorer, choosing new params distinct from previous ones to gain more information.

Looking at the recent policies, most have f(params) around 0.35 or lower. So, we're still in the Explore phase. Therefore, I need to propose a new set of params that hasn't been tried before, especially focusing on states near the holes and the goal.

I should ensure that each state's action doesn't lead into a hole with any possible move. For example, if moving right from state 3 is a hole, then in state 2 (which is to the left), choosing right might be risky.

Looking at state 15: it's the goal, so no need for an action there since the episode ends. But params[15] should still be set to something safe, maybe 3, which has a mix of moves but avoiding possible holes.

For other states, I need to choose actions that have higher chances of moving towards the goal or staying safe. Since the environment is slippery, each action has three possibilities. So, the policy must choose actions that maximize the probability of reaching state 15 without falling into any hole.

I should also consider that the agent might take multiple steps due to the slipperiness, so planning a path from each state towards the goal while avoiding holes is crucial.

After considering all this, I'll propose a new set of params where each state chooses an action that has the highest probability of moving closer to the goal without stepping into any holes. For example, states near the bottom-right should aim right or down, and other states should choose actions that move towards those directions.
