You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to find the optimal policy for a FrozenLake environment with 4x4 grid. The goal is to reach state 15 (bottom right corner) while avoiding holes. The agent has actions that don't always go as planned due to the slippery nature of the environment.

First, I need to understand how the environment works. Each action taken by the agent doesn't necessarily lead directly to the intended movement because there's a 33% chance it could move in one of three directions depending on the action chosen. For example, choosing action 0 (left) might result in moving down, left, or up with equal probability.

The reward is +1 when reaching state 15 and 0 elsewhere, except for falling into holes which end the episode immediately. So, the policy needs to maximize the chances of reaching the goal while avoiding any paths that lead to holes.

Looking at the top-performing policies provided, all have average rewards around 0.15. This suggests that none of them are consistently reaching the goal, as the theoretical maximum should be around 1.0 if a perfect policy is found. Therefore, my approach should focus on exploring different strategies to find a better configuration.

Given that I'm in iteration 189 out of 5000, there's still plenty of time to explore and refine the policy. Since the current policies aren't performing well, I'll adopt an exploratory strategy. This means changing as many parameters as possible from previous attempts to gather new information about which actions lead closer to the goal or avoid holes.

I need to ensure that each parameter is set to a value (0-3) that hasn't been tried before in this specific state. By doing so, I can potentially discover new trajectories that either reach the goal or provide insights into which states are safe and which aren't.

For example, looking at the previous params, many have a pattern where certain states always choose action 1 or 3. To break away from this, I'll assign different actions to key states like state 0 (top-left), state 7 (end of top row), state 8 (start of third row), and so on.

I'll start by setting params[0] to 2 instead of the common 1 or others. This means when in the top-left corner, the agent will try a different action with higher probability. Similarly, for other states like 1, I'll choose an action that hasn't been used before to see if it leads to a better outcome.

By systematically changing each parameter and ensuring no repetition from past configurations, I can maximize the information gained in future iterations. This approach should help identify which actions lead towards the goal or avoid dangerous holes, ultimately guiding us closer to the optimal policy.
