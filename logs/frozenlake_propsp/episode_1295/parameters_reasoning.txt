You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

Do NOT output anything else. No explanation, no reasoning, nothing.



LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with the highest possible reward, avoiding holes along the way. From what I understand, each action taken by the agent doesn't always lead directly to the intended movement because of the slippery nature of the environment. Instead, it has a 33% chance to move in one of three directions.

Looking at the previous top-performing policies and their trajectories, most have f(params) around 0.45 or lower. This suggests that the current best isn't very close to the optimal reward of 1.0, so I should be acting as an Explorer rather than an Optimizer. My goal now is to propose a new set of parameters that hasn't been tried before and can potentially gather more information about the environment.

I'll start by examining some of the trajectories provided. For instance, in one of the top params, the trajectory was (0,1) leading to (4,3), which ended without reaching the goal. Another trajectory went from (0,3) to (1,2) and then stuck in a loop. This indicates that certain actions near the edges might be causing the agent to get stuck or move away from the goal.

I should focus on creating a policy where each state leads the agent towards the goal as much as possible while minimizing the chances of falling into holes. Since the environment is 4x4, I can map out safe paths and ensure that each action in the policy directs the agent towards these paths.

Let me think about each state:

- State 0 (top-left corner): Moving right or down could be beneficial. However, considering the slippery nature, choosing an action that generally moves towards the goal might be best. Let's pick action 1 (right) as it tends to move right but can also go down or left with equal probability.

- State 1 (top-middle): From here, moving right again might help, but sometimes the agent could drift down. Action 3, which has a mix of up, right, and down, could be better as it allows some upward movement to avoid potential holes below.

Continuing this logic for each state, I'll aim to set actions that encourage movement towards the goal while considering possible safe paths. It's important to ensure that states near the edges have actions that don't lead into holes but instead guide towards the center or directly towards state 15.

After mapping out each state's optimal action based on proximity to the goal and avoiding holes, I'll construct a new params array. This should be different from any previous attempts to maximize information gain and potentially find a better reward.
