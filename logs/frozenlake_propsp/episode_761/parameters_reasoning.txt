You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me start by understanding the setup.

The environment is a 4x4 grid where each state corresponds to a number from 0 to 15. The agent can move in four directions: left, down, right, up. However, because the lake is slippery, taking an action leads the agent to one of three possible states with equal probability. For example, if the agent takes action 0 (left), it might end up moving down, left, or up.

The goal is state 15, which gives a reward of +1, while all other states give 0. There are holes in the grid that cause the episode to end immediately upon stepping on them. My task is to find the policy (params array) that maximizes the average episodic reward over 20 episodes.

From the user's message, I see that the current best policies have rewards around 0.45, which is below the target of 1.0. This suggests we're still in the exploration phase rather than exploitation. The goal is to explore different policies to gather more information about the environment and identify safe paths.

Looking at the recent policies provided, it seems that many are getting stuck or falling into holes because their trajectories either loop indefinitely or don't reach state 15 quickly. For instance, one trajectory involves moving from (0,3) to (1,3), looping several times without making progress towards the goal. Another trajectory gets stuck in a cycle between states 4 and 8.

To improve, I need to design policies that avoid these loops and holes while progressing towards state 15. One approach is to ensure that each state's action leads the agent closer to the goal or at least doesn't increase the distance. Since movement is probabilistic, the policy should choose actions that have a high probability of moving in the right direction.

Let me map out potential safe paths from each state:

- Start at 0 (top-left corner). The best move would be down (action 1) to go towards the goal. But considering slippyness, action 1 has possible moves: right, down, left. Moving down is a good step.

Wait, but the agent can't guarantee moving in one direction because of the slipperiness. So the policy should choose actions that have the highest chance of moving towards the goal across all possible outcomes.

Another idea is to create a deterministic path when possible. For example, if from state 0 (top-left), choosing action 3 (right) would move the agent right with some probability and possibly down or up. But since the grid wraps around (I think it's toroidal), moving up from 0 would take it to 12, which is a hole? Or maybe not—need to clarify.

Wait, in FrozenLake, the standard setup has holes in certain states like 5,6,7,... but I need to confirm. From the user's examples, some trajectories end on state 8 or others without mentioning holes, so perhaps the holes are specific.

Alternatively, perhaps I should focus on ensuring that from each state, the chosen action doesn't lead into a hole with any of its possible moves and has a high chance of moving towards the goal.

To do this systematically:

1. Identify all states and their adjacent states based on actions.
2. For each state, determine which action has the highest probability of leading closer to the goal without stepping into holes.

But without knowing exactly where the holes are, it's challenging. The user mentioned that the agent should avoid holes by using previous trajectories. So from the provided data, I can infer which states might be near holes or which actions lead to failure.

Looking at recent trajectories:

- One trajectory was (0,1) leading to 4, then 8, etc., and getting a reward of 0.45. That suggests that state 4 is safe, but perhaps the agent didn't reach the goal quickly.
- Another trajectory had (0,3) leading to (1,3), which could be a hole or not.

Wait, maybe I should look at the best-performing policies and see what their actions are, then tweak them.

The top policy was:
params[0]: 1; ... f(params): 0.45
Trajectory: (0,1) -> (4,2) -> (8,2)

So from state 0, action 1 leads to either right, down, or left. So possible moves are:

- Right: 1
- Down: 4
- Left: 3

But the trajectory shows moving to state 4, which suggests that taking action 1 from 0 can lead towards the goal.

From state 4 (second row, first column), action 2 is taken. Action 2's possible moves are up, right, down. So:

- Up: 0
- Right:5
- Down:8

The trajectory goes to state 8, so maybe from 4, moving down leads closer.

State 8 is the third row, first column. Action 3 is taken, which has possible moves left, up, right.

Wait, no—looking at the params for state 8 in that policy was 3, but let me check: the top policy had params[8]:3, which would be action 3. So from state 8, action 3 can lead to:

- Left:7
- Up:4
- Right:9

If the trajectory went from 8 to ... Wait, in that particular run, it was (0,1) -> (4,2) -> (8,2). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused with state numbering.

Wait, the state is between 0 and 15. So row 0: 0-3; row1:4-7; row2:8-11; row3:12-15.

So from state 0 (row0, col0), action 1 could lead to:

Possible moves when taking action 1 are right (state1), down (state4), or left (state3).

But moving left from state0 would take it to state3, which is the top row third column. If that's a hole, then action1 might be better because with probability 1/3, it can move down towards the goal.

Similarly, in state4 (row1, col0), action2 could lead up (state0), right (state5), or down (state8). So perhaps choosing action2 from state4 is risky if moving up leads back to start and right might be a hole.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to choose actions that increase the row number since the goal is at row3.

But I'm getting stuck on details. Maybe I should propose a new policy that tries to move towards the goal with as few loops as possible.

Another approach: set up a deterministic policy where each state's action leads directly towards the goal, considering all possible moves due to slipperiness.

Alternatively, let me consider an optimal path from any given state:

From state 0 (0,0), the best action would be down (to 4) or right (to1). But since movement is probabilistic, perhaps choosing an action that has a higher chance of moving towards the goal.

Wait, but in this setup, each action leads to three possible states. So from state 0:

- Action 0: left → move down, left, up → which would be states 4,3, or 15 (if up from 0 is row3, col0? Wait, no—up from 0 would wrap around to the last row.

Wait, perhaps I need to clarify how movement works. In FrozenLake, moving beyond grid boundaries wraps around. So for example, moving left from state0 might take it to state3 (if that's allowed), or maybe it stays in place? Or perhaps moving left from 0 goes to state3, which is the same row but previous column.

Wait no—state numbering is 4 rows and 4 columns, each state represents a cell. So state0 is (row0, col0). Moving up would go to (row-1, col0), which wraps to row3, so state12 + col0 → state12? Or perhaps it's not wrapped; instead, moving up from row0 stays in row0 or goes somewhere else. Wait, no—in standard FrozenLake, I think movement is allowed only within the grid, and going beyond remains in place.

Wait, no—actually, in many RL environments, movements that go beyond grid boundaries stay in the same cell. So for example, moving up from state0 (top-left) might not change the state because you can't move up further.

But according to the user's setup, when taking an action, the agent moves to three possible directions with equal probability. So perhaps movement is such that trying to go beyond the grid still counts as a direction but wraps around or stays in place.

Wait, the user says:

"When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability."

So for each action, three possible directions. For example, action0 can cause moving down, left, or up, regardless of current position. So if the agent is in state0 (row0, col0), taking action0 would try to move up, but since it's on row0, moving up might not be possible—does it wrap around? Or does it stay in the same cell?

This is a critical detail. If movement beyond grid boundaries isn't allowed and stays in place, then from state0, action0 (up) would keep the agent at state0.

Alternatively, if the grid is toroidal (wrapping), moving up from row0 goes to row3.

Given that the user didn't specify, but since in their example a trajectory was (0,1) → (4,2), which suggests that moving down from 0 would go to 4, which makes sense as rows are stacked. So row0 is top, row3 is bottom.

So movement is possible across all four directions, and each action corresponds to three possible moves regardless of the position.

Therefore, for state0 (row0, col0):

- Action0: move down (to4), left (invalid, perhaps stays or wraps?), up (wraps to row3, col0 → state12).

Wait, this is getting complicated. Perhaps it's better to assume that movement beyond grid boundaries doesn't change the state.

But in any case, the user has provided trajectories from previous policies, and I can see that certain actions lead towards or away from the goal.

Given that, perhaps a good strategy is to have each state's action choose an action that tends to move towards the bottom-right direction (towards state15), considering all possible outcomes.

For example:

- From states in row0, prefer actions that move down.
- From states in column3, prefer right actions if possible, but since it's the last column, perhaps moving up or down.

Alternatively, let me try to construct a policy where each state has an action that maximizes the chance of moving towards the goal.

But without knowing the exact hole positions, this is tricky. Maybe I should look for states that are near the holes based on trajectories and set their actions to avoid those directions.

Looking at recent policies:

- One had trajectory (0,3) → (1,3), which could be a path leading towards a hole.
- Another had (8,2) as part of the trajectory, but no mention of falling into a hole.

Wait, I'm not sure about that. Maybe I should focus on generating a new policy that differs from previous ones and explores different paths to gather more data.

Since we're in iteration 761, after several attempts, perhaps it's time to start optimizing based on the best-performing policies so far.

The top policy had params[0]:1, which suggests action1 (right) is chosen for state0. Let's see if changing that could help.

Alternatively, let me propose a new policy where each state chooses an action that has the highest chance of moving towards the goal without falling into known holes.

But since I don't know where the holes are, perhaps it's safer to choose actions that minimize the risk of getting stuck in loops or going back.

Given that, maybe from states in row0 and col0, choosing action1 (right) is better than others because it moves towards the goal. Similarly, from state4, choosing action2 (up, right, down) but perhaps right would lead closer to the goal.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Maybe a better approach is to look for any patterns in the best policies and see if tweaking them can improve performance.

Looking at the top policy:

params[0]:1; params[1]:3; ... 

So from state0: action1 (right), which would have possible moves right, down, left.

But perhaps choosing a different action might lead to a higher reward. For example, setting state0's action to 2 (up, right, down). But without knowing the outcome, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, maybe from state0, action3 is better because it allows moving right or up, which could be safer.

Wait, another idea: perhaps set all states in row0 and column0 to move down towards the goal. For example:

- State0: action1 (right) to increase column.
- State4: action2 (down) to go further down.

But I'm not sure how this would play out with the slippyness.

Alternatively, perhaps for each state, select an action that increases the row number, moving towards the goal. For example:

- States in row0 choose actions that can move down.
- States in row1 choose actions that can move down or right.
- Etc.

But this is just a rough idea.

Given the time constraints and the need to propose a new policy now, perhaps I'll generate a new set of parameters based on previous best policies but tweak a few states to see if it improves the reward.

For example:

- Keep the general structure of the top policy but change some actions in critical states like those near the goal or potential holes.

Alternatively, try setting all states to choose action that moves them right or down as much as possible.

But without knowing where the holes are, this is speculative. Maybe I should just propose a new set of parameters that are distinct from previous ones, ensuring exploration.
