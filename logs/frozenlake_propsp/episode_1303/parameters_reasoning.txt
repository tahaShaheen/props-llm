You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to propose the next set of parameters for the FrozenLake environment. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward by getting the agent to reach state 15 without falling into any holes. 

First, let me understand the problem setup again. The grid is 4x4 with states numbered from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). Some states are holes, and stepping on them ends the episode with no reward. The environment is slippery, meaning each action leads to one of three directions randomly. 

The policy is a function that maps each state to an action, represented by an array of 16 numbers where each element can be 0,1,2,3. The challenge is to find the optimal policy that maximizes the reward.

Looking at the interactions so far, I see that the user provided some top-performing policies and recent ones. The best rewards are around 0.45, which is significantly below the target of 1.0. That suggests we're not yet exploiting optimally, but maybe exploring more could help find a better policy.

The recent policies have lower rewards, like 0.25 or even 0.05, indicating that some recent attempts might be leading to holes more often. Maybe those policies aren't avoiding the traps effectively. 

I need to propose a new set of params that's different from previous ones and potentially improves the reward. Since the current top rewards are around 0.45, which is not close to 1.0, I should focus on exploring rather than optimizing. So I'll aim for a policy that hasn't been tried before and could lead the agent closer to state 15.

Looking at previous policies, many have params[0] as 1 or 2. Maybe trying a different action from the start could help. Let's say we set params[0] to 3, which is action right. Then, for other states, I'll try to choose actions that move towards state 15 without risking falling into holes.

I should also ensure that each state's action doesn't lead to a hole with high probability. For example, if moving down from state 7 leads to a hole, maybe choosing another direction could help avoid it.

Let me outline the proposed params step by step:

- Start at state 0 (top-left). Action right (3) should take it towards state 1.
- From state 1, action up or right might be better. Let's choose action 3 again to go right to state 2.
- Continue this pattern, ensuring each move doesn't risk falling into a hole.

I'll create a policy where most states move towards the goal (right and down), avoiding actions that could lead to holes. This way, even with the slippery nature, there's a higher chance of reaching state 15.
