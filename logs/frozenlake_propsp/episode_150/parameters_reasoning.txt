You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to find the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment using a grid-based approach and Monte Carlo policy gradient (MC-GP) as described. The goal is to reach state 15 (state with index 15) which has a reward of +1, while all other states give zero. There are some holes in the map that can trap the agent if it steps onto them.

First, I know that the policy is represented by an array of parameters where each parameter corresponds to an action when the state equals its index. The current setup initializes the parameters as [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], which suggests that all actions are equally likely in the initial setup.

I recall that MC-GP uses a sample-based policy gradient method where each sample is an episode (a trajectory of state-action pairs) generated by following the current policy. For each parameter θ in [0,1), we generate samples by sampling a random action according to π_θ, then generating subsequent actions using the Q-function based on the current parameters.

The key here is that during exploration, I should avoid states I've already visited. This is crucial because visiting the same state repeatedly can lead to getting stuck in local optima instead of exploring more optimal paths.

Given that each state's value function f(θ) depends only on its immediate next state, the process involves sampling trajectories and estimating the gradient for each parameter based on these samples. The average gradient across all sampled trajectories gives a better estimate than using just one sample because it incorporates the information from multiple episodes.

I need to consider how many parameters I have: there are 16 states (0-15), so four parameters. Each parameter is an action, which can be 0, 1, 2, or 3. The goal is to find the set of actions that maximizes the expected reward when following this policy.

I should also note that each sample's value function f(θ) gives me a way to compute the gradient by estimating how changing θ affects the expected reward. By averaging over multiple samples, I can get a more reliable estimate of the true gradient.

Since the problem mentions that not all previously seen parameters are useful, it's important to ensure each new parameter setting is based on an episode that hasn't been used before. This avoids reusing trajectories and ensures diversity in the data collected for each parameter estimation.

Considering the structure of the grid, especially with some holes (state 7 being a hole), the agent must find paths around these traps. The optimal policy would typically prioritize actions that allow reaching state 15 without getting stuck, perhaps favoring action 0 or 3 if it leads towards the goal.

I think the best approach is to generate multiple samples for each parameter setup and use their average gradients to update the parameters iteratively. This way, I can converge on an optimal policy that maximizes the expected reward across all possible episodes, including those from previously unseen states.
