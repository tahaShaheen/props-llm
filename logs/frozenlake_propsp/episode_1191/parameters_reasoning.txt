You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 1191 out of 5000. OUTPUT ONLY THIS SINGLE LINE:
params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W
Do NOT output anything else. No explanation, no reasoning, nothing.



LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with the highest reward possible, which should be around 1.0. The challenge is that the agent moves in a slippery way, so actions don't always lead directly to where we want.

First, I need to understand the grid layout. It's a 4x4 grid, with states numbered from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). Holes are present in some states, which end the episode if stepped on. The agent can move in four directions, but due to slipperiness, each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability.

Looking at the provided top 5 best-performing params and their trajectories, it seems that most policies are getting stuck or not reaching the goal efficiently. For example, several trajectories loop around states without making progress towards state 15. The highest reward observed is 0.45, which is significantly below the target of 1.0.

Since I'm supposed to act as a stateless optimizer, I need to maximize information gain each time. Given that the rewards are still low, I should focus on exploring new configurations rather than tweaking existing ones. The goal is to find a policy that avoids holes and efficiently navigates towards state 15.

I notice that in previous attempts, some policies tend to get stuck in cycles or take too long to reach the goal. To avoid this, I need to ensure that each state's action leads the agent closer to the goal without increasing the risk of falling into a hole. Maybe adjusting certain states' actions could help break loops and guide the agent more directly.

For example, in state 0 (top-left), if the current policy is action 1 (which might move down, left, or up), perhaps changing it to action 2 or 3 could lead the agent towards state 4 or 1 instead. Similarly, for other states, I should check if their actions are pointing towards paths that either loop or approach holes.

I'll consider each state and decide the best action that maximizes progress towards state 15 while minimizing the chance of hitting a hole. This might involve selecting actions that generally move the agent right or down, as those directions lead closer to the goal in most cases.

After evaluating possible changes for each state, I'll construct a new params array where each position is set to an action that avoids loops and steers towards the goal. The aim is to create a policy that doesn't repeat states unnecessarily and efficiently navigates through the grid.
