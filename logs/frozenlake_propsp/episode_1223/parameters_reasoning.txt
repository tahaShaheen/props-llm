You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. So, I'm given a 4x4 grid where the agent can move in four directions—up, down, left, right. But because the environment is slippery, each action doesn't take the agent directly but instead has it choose among three possible directions with equal probability. The goal is to reach state 15 (bottom-right corner) for a reward of +1, and all other states give 0. There are also holes that end the episode if stepped on.

From the problem statement, I understand that the policy is an array of 16 elements, each corresponding to a state from 0 to 15. Each element can be 0-3, indicating the action to take in that state. The agent needs to avoid falling into holes while trying to reach the goal.

Looking at the history provided, I see several top-performing policies and their trajectories. For instance, one policy had an average reward of 0.45 with a trajectory going through states (0,1), (4,1), (8,1). Another had 0.35 but got stuck in loops or ended up falling into a hole.

The recent policies have lower rewards, some even getting zero. This suggests that maybe the current strategies aren't efficiently navigating to the goal without hitting holes too often.

I need to propose a new policy that's different from what's been tried before and maximizes the chance of reaching state 15 while avoiding holes. Since the environment is slippery, it's crucial for each state's action to have a high probability path towards the goal without leading into dangerous areas.

Let me think about each state:

- State 0 (top-left): Maybe moving right or down. But since actions are probabilistic, choosing an action that can move towards either direction might be better.
- State 1: Similarly, maybe moving right or down to avoid getting stuck on the edges where holes might be.
- States closer to the goal (like 12, 13, 14, 15) should have actions that directly aim for 15.

But since each action has a 1/3 chance of three directions, I need to ensure that from each state, there's a path that can reach the goal without hitting holes. It might be safer to move towards the right and down as those are the general directions towards the goal.

I should also check which states are holes. From the trajectories provided, it seems like some states when taken certain actions lead to falling into holes. For example, in one trajectory, the agent falls into a hole after moving left from state 3 (which is top-right corner). So, I need to make sure that for each state, the chosen action doesn't have a high probability of leading into such dangerous areas.

Perhaps focusing on a policy where states near the bottom and right edges are set to move towards the goal, while other states move either right or down. Also, avoiding actions that could lead back up or left when in lower rows or columns.

I should propose a new set of parameters that differ from previous ones. Looking at recent policies, many have params[0] as 1 or 2. Maybe setting it to 3 (which includes moving left, up, or right) might help in exploring more paths without getting stuck.

But wait, if state 0 is top-left, action 3 would allow the agent to move up, which isn't possible from there, so the effective moves would be right and down. That could be beneficial as it opens two out of three directions towards the goal.

Similarly, for other states like 1 (top-middle), choosing actions that can either go down or right more often might help. Maybe action 3 again, which includes left, up, right—so from state 1, moving right is a good option to get closer to the goal.

For states in the bottom row, they should be set to move right as much as possible towards state 15. But since each action can only choose between three directions with equal probability, setting their actions to right might not always work due to slipperiness, but it's a start.

I need to make sure that from every state, the chosen action doesn't have any of its three possible outcomes leading into a hole. For example, if moving left from a certain state leads to a hole, then the policy for that state should avoid actions where left is an option unless necessary.

Overall, I think a greedy approach towards the goal while considering potential holes might work. So, let's try setting each state's action to prioritize right and down movements as much as possible without getting trapped.
