You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me try to understand what's going on here.

First, the environment is a 4x4 grid where each state is represented by numbers from 0 to 15. The goal is state 15, which gives a reward of +1, and all other states give 0. But there are holes in the grid that end the episode if stepped on.

The slippery nature of the environment means that when an agent takes an action, it doesn't always go where intended. Instead, it moves to one of three directions with equal probability depending on the action chosen. For example, taking action 0 (left) might result in moving down, left, or up each with a 1/3 chance.

The policy is defined by an array of 16 elements (params), where each element corresponds to the action taken when in that state. The challenge is to find the optimal set of actions that maximizes the reward, especially since some actions could lead to holes.

Looking at the provided information, all previous policies tried so far have resulted in very low rewards, around 0.10 to 0.15 on average. This suggests that the current strategies aren't effective enough in reaching the goal consistently without falling into holes.

Since we're at iteration 186 out of 5000 and the rewards are still below 1.0, I need to act as an Explorer. My goal is to propose a new set of parameters that explore different paths towards the goal while avoiding known holes.

I remember from the initial setup that certain states are more risky than others. For example, state 4 (which is the top-left of the second row) might have a hole. So, I should make sure that in such states, the agent takes actions that avoid moving into those holes.

Let me consider what each action does in terms of movement possibilities:

- Action 0: [down, left, up]
- Action 1: [right, down, left]
- Action 2: [up, right, down]
- Action 3: [left, up, right]

I want the agent to move towards state 15 as efficiently as possible. The optimal path would likely involve moving right and down from start (state 0). But because of the slippery nature, I need policies that increase the chances of moving in the desired direction while not stepping on holes.

Looking at previous attempts, many had params set to either all 1s or alternating actions which didn't yield high rewards. So perhaps a different approach is needed.

I think setting up policies where each state encourages movement towards the goal without leading into known dangerous states would be better. For example, in state 0 (start), choosing action 3 might help move right, up, or down with equal chance, which could help progress towards the goal but avoiding left which might not be helpful.

I should also make sure that once the agent is closer to the goal, like in state 12 (the bottom-left of the third row), it takes actions that push it further right. Similarly, in states near the top or left, encourage moving down and right.

Given all this, I'll propose a new set of parameters where each state's action is chosen to generally move towards the goal, considering possible slippery outcomes. For example:

- Start at 0: choose action 3 (right, up, down) to have a chance to go right.
- In state 1: perhaps action 1 to go right or down.
- Continue this logic for each state, ensuring that the movement is generally towards the goal while avoiding actions that could lead into holes.

I need to make sure that I'm not repeating previous params and that each new set offers a different exploration path. Since all prior policies have low rewards, varying the actions in a structured way that pushes towards the goal without getting stuck or falling into holes should help.
