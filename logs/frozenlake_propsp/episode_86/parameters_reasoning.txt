You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15, which is the bottom right corner of the grid. All other states give a reward of 0, but stepping into the hole at state 12 (state 12: 13) gives a reward of +1. 

The policy parameters are an array of 16 values representing actions for each state from 0 to 15. Each value is between 0 and 3, indicating which action to take when in that state. The challenge here is to choose these actions such that the total expected reward is maximized.

First, I recall that this is a Markov Decision Process (MDP) where each state has transitions to other states based on actions. The policy needs to maximize the expected cumulative reward starting from any given state. Because of the slippery environment, each action doesn't lead to a fixed probability distribution; instead, each action leads to 3 possible directions with equal probability.

I also remember that in such problems, the optimal policy can be found using value iteration or policy gradient methods. Since we're using policy gradients here, I'm thinking about how to maximize the expected reward by choosing actions based on the current state's value function.

The given options for params[i] (0-15) are each action numbers, so each state is assigned a specific action that will be taken during training. The current best policies provided have varying values, but I need to choose parameters that might not be in the top 10 but could lead to better performance.

I should consider which actions are more promising based on their impact on reaching the goal. For instance, sometimes taking an action with a lower immediate reward (like moving left when at state 1) can lead to safer transitions towards the hole or further rewards.

One approach is to test different combinations of actions for key states. For example, in the hole at state 12, you want to avoid stepping on it. So, if I take action 0 (move down from state 5), I might end up staying in a safe area. Alternatively, taking action 3 (move left) could bring me closer to the hole.

I should also consider the transitions from each state. For instance, from state 14, taking an action that leads into the hole is bad. Therefore, the policy must avoid such actions unless it's absolutely necessary.

Moreover, when exploring trajectories, I need to ensure that my exploration doesn't just revisit previously seen parameters but tries new ones. Since some of the top-performing policies have values like 2 and 3, which might correspond to different directions, perhaps trying combinations where these are used can help avoid getting stuck in local optima.

Another thought is whether action 1 (right) could lead to more favorable transitions. For example, from state 0, action 1 leads to state 4 via right, which is adjacent. This might be beneficial as it's part of a path towards the goal without stepping into the hole immediately.

I also recall that sometimes using exploration strategies like randomizing in multiple actions can help escape local optima. Perhaps adjusting some params[i] slightly from their current values could lead to better results. For instance, increasing or decreasing certain parameters based on their recent performance could yield a more globally optimal policy.

Finally, I think about how the value function changes with different policies. By evaluating each possible parameter combination and its resulting expected rewards, I can identify which ones maximize the total reward. However, this process would require testing all 4016 combinations (since there are 16 parameters each taking 4 values), which might be computationally intensive if done manually.

In summary, my strategy is to systematically test different parameter combinations for key states, focusing on actions that avoid stepping into the hole and lead towards the goal's optimal path. I'll aim for a balance between exploring new policies and exploiting known good ones while considering the slippery transitions that make this problem particularly challenging.
