You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I need to find the best policy for the FrozenLake environment described. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) without falling into any holes. The agent can move in four directions, but each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability due to the slippery nature of the grid.

First, I should figure out where the holes are because that's crucial for avoiding them. From the trajectories provided, I notice some paths lead to falls. For example, the third parameter set leads to state 14 being visited, which might be a hole since the reward is low. Similarly, other parameters end in states like (0,3) or (2,3), which could be holes.

I need to ensure that each state's action chosen by the policy doesn't lead into a hole with any probability. That means for each state i, params[i] should choose an action that moves towards safe directions only.

Looking at the top-performing parameters, they have an average reward of 0.30, which is below the optimal 1.0. This suggests that there's room for improvement. The recent parameters aren't performing well either, so I need to explore more effectively.

I should consider making all states move towards the goal (state 15) as much as possible. For example, from state 0 (top-left), moving right or down would be better since it can reach state 15 eventually. Similarly, other states should have actions that guide towards the goal without risking falling into holes.

Given the slippery nature, I need to choose actions that minimize the risk of landing in a hole when considering all possible movement outcomes. For instance, if from state 8 (third row, first column), moving right leads to state 9, which might be safe, while other moves could lead elsewhere.

I think setting most states to move towards the goal or stay on safe paths would help. Maybe using action 1 for some states and action 3 for others depending on their position relative to the goal.

Wait, considering the movement probabilities: each action leads to three directions. So choosing an action that increases the chance of moving towards the goal without falling into a hole is key. For example, in state 0, action 2 (up) would keep it in place, but maybe action 1 or 3 is better for progress.

I need to map out each state and decide which action maximizes the probability of reaching the goal without risking holes. Perhaps starting from the goal and working backwards, ensuring that each state's actions lead towards safe states leading to the goal.

After analyzing, I'll set up a policy where each state i has an action that directs towards the right or down as much as possible, avoiding known hole positions based on previous trajectories.
