You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Do NOT output anything else. No explanation, no reasoning, nothing.



LLM:
<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment using the given parameters. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right corner) with a reward of +1, but there are holes that will trap the agent if stepped on. The agent can take actions based on the provided params array.

First, I'll start by understanding how the policy works. Each action corresponds to an index in the params array, and each value indicates which action should be taken from that state. For example, if params[0] is 2, then when in state 0, the agent should take action 2.

The environment has a slippery mechanism where each action leads to three possible next states with equal probability (1/3 chance for each). This means that the movement isn't deterministic; the agent explores different paths when taking actions.

I recall that the global optimal policy is elusive because the presence of holes and the slippery nature can lead to suboptimal paths. So, I need to test various parameter combinations to find the best one.

Looking at the top performing parameters from the examples given, several have action 3 (left) or 2 (down/up) in specific states. For instance, params[0] = 2 and params[1] = 3 seem to encourage certain movements. However, without more exploration, it's hard to tell which combination is best.

I'll start by assuming some values for the parameters. Since each can be 0, 1, or 2, there are multiple possibilities. I might need to try several combinations to see how they affect the policy and the reward.

I'll consider starting with all params set to 1, as that's a common starting point in such problems because it encourages some deterministic movement. Then, I can adjust based on the observed rewards from the examples.

After setting initial parameters, the agent will explore various paths due to the slippery action leading to multiple options. The reward function f(params) is calculated by summing the immediate rewards and future states.

I might want to try a few more parameter combinations, like having params[0] = 2, params[1] = 3, and others as 1 or 2, to see if that improves the reward from navigating around the holes.

Since I don't have specific knowledge of which parameters are better, I'll proceed by trying some values. Starting with a few different configurations might give me an idea of how each action affects the exploration and rewards.
