You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get an average reward of around 1.0, which means the agent should reliably reach state 15 without falling into any holes.

Looking at the history provided, all the previous policies have low rewards (around 0.10 or less). This suggests that the current strategies aren't effectively reaching the goal or are getting stuck in loops or falling into holes too often.

I need to propose a new set of params that's different from what's been tried before. The key is to maximize information gain, so I should choose actions that might help the agent explore more efficiently towards state 15.

Let me think about each state:

- State 0 (top-left corner): It's slippery, so whatever action taken will have a 33% chance of moving in three directions. To move right or down is better for progress. Let's try action 1 which has a mix of right, down, left.

- State 1: Being on the top row next to the start. Action 2 might push it towards the middle or right.

Wait, but each state's policy needs to be set in a way that avoids holes and moves towards the goal. Maybe I should consider for each state what action would best help reach the goal while considering the slippery nature.

Alternatively, perhaps setting all states to action 1 except some key positions might allow the agent to explore more directions without getting stuck.

Wait, but looking at the previous attempts, using action 1 in most states didn't yield good results. So maybe I need a different approach.

Another thought: The optimal policy should guide the agent towards state 15 with minimal risk of falling into holes. So for each state, choose an action that has a high probability of moving closer to the goal or avoiding known holes.

For example, states in the top row (0-3) might benefit from trying to move down or right, depending on their position. Similarly, middle states should push towards the bottom-right.

But since the environment is slippery and actions are stochastic, it's challenging to plan exact paths.

Given that all previous policies had low rewards, I should try a completely different strategy. Maybe setting most params to action 2, which has right as one of its options. Or perhaps varying the actions more across states to avoid repeating patterns.

Wait, in the initial examples, some params tried action 1 in multiple states but didn't reach the goal. So maybe I need to vary it more. Perhaps for certain key positions, set specific actions that can navigate towards the goal without getting stuck.

Alternatively, since the agent is stateless, each policy must be self-contained. Therefore, each state's action should help guide towards the goal based on its position, considering the possible slip probabilities.

I think a good approach might be to have states in the top-left quadrant move down or right, and middle states push more towards the right or bottom.

But without knowing where the holes are exactly (since they aren't specified), I need to assume that certain areas are risky. So actions should minimize the chance of moving into those holes.

Wait, the user mentioned that we can learn about the holes through previous trajectories. But since all previous policies have low rewards, maybe the holes are being triggered often, so I need a policy that avoids those states entirely.

Alternatively, perhaps focusing on reaching state 15 quickly by always pushing towards it, regardless of potential risks.

I think setting each state's action to one that has a high probability of moving towards the goal. For example:

- States in the top-left (0-3) should move down or right.
- Middle states should push towards the bottom-right.
- States near the goal should try to stay there or move towards it.

But considering the slippery nature, each action has 3 possible moves. So choosing actions that have a chance of moving closer.

Alternatively, perhaps setting all params to action 2 except for certain key positions. Action 2 allows right, down, and up. Maybe this combination can help navigate through.

Wait, let me think about what each action does:

- Action 0: Down, Left, Up
- Action 1: Right, Down, Left
- Action 2: Up, Right, Down
- Action 3: Left, Up, Right

So, for example, if I set state 0 to action 1 (right, down, left), the agent has a chance to move right or down.

Similarly, for other states, choosing actions that provide multiple avenues towards the goal might help.

Given all this, perhaps setting most params to action 1 and some to others. But since previous attempts with many 1s didn't work, I need a different approach.

Wait, maybe focusing on specific paths. For example, trying to go right as much as possible from certain states.

Alternatively, considering that the agent can take any of three directions each time, perhaps setting each state's action to one that has the highest chance of eventually reaching the goal without getting stuck in loops.

But I'm not sure about exact configurations, so maybe a good strategy is to vary the actions more across different states. For example, have some states push down, others right, etc., to create varied paths.

Given that all previous policies had low rewards, perhaps this new policy should be as different as possible from the last ones. The last few params were mostly 1s or all 1s. So maybe I can try a mix of actions across states.

For example:

- Set state 0 to action 3 (which includes right)
- State 1 to action 2 (includes right and down)
- And so on, varying the actions to allow for more exploration towards the goal.

Alternatively, set some key positions to specific actions that directly aim for the goal. For instance, states in the bottom row should push right or up if possible.

But without knowing where the holes are, it's tricky, but perhaps by varying the actions, the agent can find a path that avoids them.

In summary, I think setting each state's action to one that has a mix of movements towards the goal while avoiding previous patterns could help. So maybe creating a policy where each state chooses an action that allows movement in multiple directions, increasing the chance of reaching the goal without getting stuck.
