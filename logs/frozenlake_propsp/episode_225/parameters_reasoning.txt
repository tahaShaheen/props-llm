You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I need to find the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment using a reinforcement learning approach. The goal is to reach state 15 (the right bottom grid) and avoid the holes. Each action taken by the agent leads to different probabilities of moving, except when it's in certain states.

First, I understand that each parameter in the params array represents the action to take from the corresponding state. The parameters are [0]: 0-3 actions, which correspond to directions left, down, right, up. Each value is either 0 or 1 because they should be chosen from this set.

The agent explores through previous trajectories when it steps on holes. So, I'll need to evaluate the current policy after each interaction and explore by examining the paths taken so far.

I remember that in such policies, actions are only taken if they don't lead into a hole. The example given is a policy where certain states take action 2 (up), others take 3 (down). But I should analyze whether this makes sense.

Looking at the examples provided, some params have high rewards but sometimes result in falling into holes. For instance, params[0] being 1 leads to 0.05 reward and can fall on a hole, while another with all params set to 3 gives higher reward (0.25) but also falls on a hole.

I think the key is to focus on policies where certain states take action 3 (down), others take action 2 (up). This way, there's a balance between exploration and exploitation. For example, when in state 0, taking action 1 (right) might be safer if avoiding holes is better than getting stuck.

I also need to consider the number of iterations left. If I set params[0]:3, [1]:3, etc., will this policy explore all possible paths? Since some actions lead to falling into holes, it's a risk but necessary for exploration.

Maybe a combination where 85% of the states take action 2 (up) and others take 3 (down). This should allow exploration without being too restrictive. I'll check which combinations balance reward and avoid getting stuck in holes.
