You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 225 out of 5000. OUTPUT ONLY THIS SINGLE LINE:

Do NOT output anything else. No explanation, no reasoning, nothing.



LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to help the user optimize their policy for the FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with a reward of +1, avoiding holes which end the episode. The agent can move in four directions but because of the slippery nature, each action leads to one of three possible moves with equal probability.

First, I need to understand the setup. The grid is 4x4, states are numbered from 0 (top-left) to 15 (bottom-right). Each state's policy parameter determines the action taken when in that state. The parameters must be chosen from [0,1,2,3], each corresponding to a different set of possible moves.

Looking at the previous interactions and the provided data, the user has tried several policies with varying rewards, but none have reached the optimal 1.0 reward yet. The highest so far is 0.20. So, I need to explore or exploit based on the strategy outlined.

The user mentioned that if the rewards are below close to 1.0, we should act as an Explorer by choosing a new configuration distinct from previous ones. Since all current policies yield low rewards, it's best to continue exploring to gather more information about which states lead to holes and how to avoid them.

I should propose a policy that hasn't been tried before. Looking at the top 8 best params, I notice some patterns but need to find a unique combination. For example, maybe setting certain key states to different actions could help.

Let me think about each state:

- State 0 (top-left): It's critical because it can lead into other areas or into holes. Maybe action 1 (right) is better to move towards the goal.
- State 3: If the agent moves down from here, they might fall into a hole. So perhaps taking an action that avoids moving left or right could be safer.
- Middle states like 4,5,6,7 in the second row should navigate carefully to avoid holes.

I'll create a new policy where key states have different actions than previous top policies. For instance, set state 0 to action 1 (right), state 3 to action 2 (up or right/down). Also, ensure that other states are set to move towards the goal while avoiding risky moves.

After considering these factors, I'll outline a new params array with unique values, ensuring it's different from all previous ones provided.
