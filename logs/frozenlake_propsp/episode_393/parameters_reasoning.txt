You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, let me try to figure this out. So, the user is working on optimizing a policy for the FrozenLake environment using global RL. The goal is to reach state 15 with maximum reward, avoiding holes. 

First, I need to understand the setup. It's a 4x4 grid, states 0-15, and each state has an action that's chosen randomly among three possible directions because of the slippery nature. The policy is defined by an array of 16 actions (each from 0-3), indicating what action to take in each state.

The user provided a history of top params and recent ones, along with their rewards. From the buffer, the best reward so far is 0.25, which is way below the target of around 1.0. This suggests that we're still in the exploration phase as the rewards aren't close to optimal yet.

Looking at the most recent params, they've tried various combinations but haven't achieved high rewards. The trajectories show that many policies are getting stuck or falling into holes because the agent isn't taking safe paths.

Since we're in iteration 393 out of 5000, it's still early in the process. My goal is to propose a new set of params that can explore more efficiently, possibly avoiding previously tried configurations and maximizing information gain.

I should consider policies that guide the agent towards state 15 while minimizing the risk of falling into holes. Maybe setting actions that move right or down more often could help reach the goal faster. Also, ensuring that from each state, there's a path that avoids holes by choosing safe directions.

Looking at previous attempts, some params have high rewards but still not optimal. I need to think about how each action in different states contributes to reaching the goal safely. For example, state 0 (top-left) should move right or down, avoiding left or up which might lead into holes or away from the target.

I'll draft a new set of params where most states are encouraged to move towards the goal. I'll make sure each state's action is chosen in a way that avoids potential holes and moves closer to 15. Maybe prioritizing right and down actions for earlier states, adjusting based on known hole positions.

After considering all this, I'll propose a new params array that steers the agent effectively towards the goal while avoiding risky moves.
