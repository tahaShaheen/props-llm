You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to find the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment using a neural network-based approach.

First, I need to understand the setup. The agent is in a 4x4 grid (0-15). Each state represents a position on the grid. The action space consists of four directions: left, down, right, up. However, the policy uses an array of parameters where each parameter corresponds to an action when the agent is at a specific state.

The environment has some peculiarities:
- It's slippery, meaning when an action is taken, the next state is chosen uniformly from three possible directions.
- The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right corner) with a reward of +1. All other states give a reward of 0 except for holes, which end the game.

The policy is represented by four parameters (since it's an array of size 4), each corresponding to one action when at specific grid positions:
- params[0] corresponds to state 0.
- params[1] corresponds to state 1.
- And so on up to params[3], which corresponds to state 12.

The challenge is to find the optimal values for these parameters using a neural network. The policy needs to explore the grid and avoid holes, prioritizing states closer to the goal.

I know that exploration vs exploitation is key here. If the agent's policy always explores (exploit) when it can gather good information, it might converge too quickly or miss critical paths. So, balancing both strategies is essential.

Given the options in the top results, some have higher action values where possible and others are lower. The best performing params[0] is 2, but that leads to some holes if not careful. However, looking at the recent results, a lot of them have params set to 2 or 3, except for some states like 5 which are set to 1 (which could mean 'up' action). But others have mixed values.

The top performers sometimes set params[0] and [1] to 2, and others set some to 3. There's also a consistent value of 1 for certain actions. It seems that setting higher values in the middle or lower in specific regions helps avoid falling into holes.

I think the optimal policy should balance action choices so that the agent avoids stepping on hard spots (holes) while still moving toward the goal. Since all other states except the goal give a reward of 0, avoiding transitions with lower rewards is crucial, but also being able to reach the goal quickly is important for high f(params).

Considering recent results, some agents have policies where the best actions are in certain regions and others avoid falling into holes where possible. For instance, params[5] =1 (up) might prevent stepping into a hole that's above state 0.

I should also consider that the agent's exploration might require it to sometimes choose less optimal actions when necessary to explore other paths. This could mean setting certain parameters higher than others to encourage moving away from hard spots.

In summary, I'll set the parameters in such a way that:
- High values (2 or 3) are set where movement towards the goal is better.
- Lower values (1) are set in areas likely to lead into holes.
- The policy should explore by sometimes choosing different actions when necessary.

I think setting params[0], [1], and [2] to 3 gives a good balance of moving towards the goal without falling into holes. Also, for states that might cause problems (like state 5), keeping some actions lower could prevent getting stuck.
