You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help optimize the policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with as high a reward as possible, avoiding the holes. From what I understand, each action taken by the agent has three possible outcomes because of the slippery nature of the environment.

First, I need to look at the provided top 5 best performing params and the most recent ones. The top performers have an average reward around 0.35-0.45, which is below the target of 1.0. That suggests that we're not yet close enough to the optimal policy.

Looking at the trajectories, some get stuck in loops or fall into holes. For example, one trajectory goes (0,1) → (4,3) repeatedly, which might mean it's cycling without making progress towards state 15. Another trajectory ends quickly by falling into a hole after taking action 3 from state 12.

Since the rewards are still low, according to the strategy, I should be in "Explorer" mode. This means I need to propose a new set of params that haven't been tried before and could potentially explore new paths or avoid holes more effectively.

I'll start by examining the current best policies. They seem to have some commonalities, like moving right (action 1) from state 0. But maybe changing this action could help the agent take a different path.

Looking at state 15, it's already the goal, so that's set to action 3 as per the top performers. For other states near the edges or holes, I need to ensure the actions chosen don't lead into holes with high probability.

Perhaps for some states, changing the action could reduce the risk of falling into a hole. For example, if from state 1 (0,1), taking action 3 (which can move left, up, or right) might be better than other options. I need to see what actions are currently set and consider alternatives.

I should also think about states that lead towards the goal. Maybe certain actions from states near the bottom row could increase the chances of reaching state 15 without slipping into a hole.

Let me try modifying some key states. For instance, in state 0 (top-left), perhaps action 2 instead of action 1 or 3. Action 2 can move up, right, or down—wait, but from state 0, moving up isn't possible since it's already the top row. So action 2 would have a chance to go right or down.

I need to make sure that for each state, the chosen action has a higher probability of avoiding holes and progressing towards the goal. Maybe some states should be set to always move towards the right or down, depending on their position.

Another consideration is ensuring that once the agent reaches a certain point, it doesn't get stuck in loops. Perhaps adjusting actions in states like 4,5,6,7 (second row) could help.

I'll draft a new params array where I change some of the current best choices to explore different paths and avoid holes more effectively.
