You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward by reaching state 15, which gives +1, while avoiding holes that end the episode.

First, I need to understand the environment better. It's a 4x4 grid with slippery moves. Each action (0-3) leads to three possible directions with equal probability. So, the agent doesn't have full control over where it goes. This makes planning tricky because the next state isn't certain.

Looking at the top 5 best-performing params, I see that most of them have a reward around 0.45 or lower. The highest is 0.45, which is still below the target of 1.0. That suggests we're not yet optimal and need to explore further.

The recent params didn't perform well; one even scored 0.05. This might mean that those policies are getting stuck in loops or falling into holes frequently. So, I should focus on creating a policy that avoids such issues.

I notice that in the top-performing policies, certain states have specific actions. For example, state 0 often takes action 1 or 2. Maybe moving right (action 1) is better from state 0 to avoid getting stuck in the same spot.

Looking at the trajectories, some get trapped in cycles, like moving between states without making progress towards the goal. To break this, perhaps changing the action for certain states could help navigate more effectively.

Since the environment is slippery, it's crucial that each policy choice increases the likelihood of reaching state 15 while minimizing falls into holes. I should ensure that from each state, the chosen action has a higher probability of leading towards the goal without risking falling into a hole.

I'm thinking about how to structure the policy. Maybe states near the bottom-right (like 12, 13, 14) should prioritize moving right or down to reach state 15. For other states, choosing actions that generally move toward increasing row and column indices might be beneficial.

Also, considering the slippery nature, it's essential to have a balance between exploration and exploitation. The current policies seem to exploit some paths but aren't reaching the optimal reward yet.

I should propose a new set of params where each state chooses an action that, on average, moves closer to the goal while avoiding risky moves. For example, states in the top-left might move right or down, depending on their position.

After analyzing, I'll adjust certain params to see if they can lead to better outcomes without repeating previous attempts. The aim is to maximize information gain by trying new configurations that haven't been tested yet.
