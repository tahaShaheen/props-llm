You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. It's a 4x4 grid where the agent can move in four directions, but because it's slippery, each action leads to one of three possible moves with equal probability. The goal is state 15, which gives +1 reward, and there are holes that end the episode if stepped on.

First, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. The policy is an array of 16 elements (since there are 16 states), each representing the action taken in that state. My task is to propose a valid params array where each element is one of [0,1,2,3], without repeating any previous configurations.

Looking at the top performing params provided, they have f(params) around 0.25, which is below the target of 1.0. This suggests that none of them are optimal yet. The trajectories show various paths, but most end either by falling into a hole or reaching the goal only some of the time.

I remember from the initial problem statement that the agent needs to avoid holes while trying to reach state 15. So, the policy should guide the agent towards the goal without stepping on any holes, considering the slippery nature of movement.

Since the environment is slippery, the agent's next state isn't certain when taking an action. Therefore, the policy must account for all possible transitions and choose actions that maximize the chance of reaching the goal without hitting a hole.

Looking at the recent params trials, I notice that some have lower rewards, so maybe we need to try more varied strategies. For example, perhaps making some states take specific actions more consistently could help avoid holes.

I think about how each action's probabilities affect movement. For instance, action 0 leads to down, left, or up with equal chance. So in certain states, choosing a particular action might reduce the risk of falling into a hole based on the surrounding state layout.

I should also consider the grid layout and where the holes are located. Since I don't have exact information about which states are holes, I need to infer them from the trajectories. For example, if an agent falls into a hole in a particular state, that state must be a hole.

Looking at the recent trajectories, some end quickly, indicating possible holes near the start. For instance, trajectory (0,3) might lead to a hole because it ended immediately after moving right or something. So, maybe certain actions from state 0 could lead to holes, and thus should be avoided.

Given that, perhaps I need to adjust the policy so that in states adjacent to potential holes, the agent chooses actions that move away from those holes.

But without knowing exactly where the holes are, I have to make educated guesses based on trajectories. For example, if moving right from state 0 often leads to a hole, then action 1 (which includes right as one of three options) should be avoided in state 0. So, maybe set params[0] to another action.

In the current top params, some have params[0] set to 2 or 1. Maybe trying action 3 for state 0 could help, as it allows movement up, right, or left, but perhaps avoiding certain directions that lead to holes.

Alternatively, setting all states near the edges to move towards the goal while avoiding risky moves. For example, in state 15 (the goal), no action is needed, so maybe set params[15] to any action since it's already at the target.

I think a possible approach is to create a deterministic policy that guides the agent towards the right and down directions as much as possible, considering the slippery nature. However, because of the slipperiness, we need to account for all possible movements.

Wait, but since each action leads to three possible moves with equal probability, choosing an action that has a higher chance of moving closer to the goal might be better. For example, in state 0 (top-left corner), moving right or down would help progress towards the goal. But due to slipperiness, any action could take the agent elsewhere.

Perhaps I should make states near the bottom and right choose actions that push them further towards the goal. For instance, in state 12 (the bottom row's leftmost state), choosing an action that mainly moves right or up might help.

But without knowing where exactly the holes are, it's tricky. Maybe a safer approach is to have states on the edges move towards the center or towards the goal while avoiding certain directions.

I also notice that in some trajectories, agents end up cycling between states, which suggests they're not making progress towards the goal and might be stuck near a hole or in a loop.

Given all this, perhaps I should propose a policy where most states take action 2 or 3, as these actions have a mix of movements that could help navigate towards the goal. Alternatively, maybe setting certain key states to specific actions to avoid known problematic transitions.

Since the top params had f(params) around 0.25, which is lower than desired, I need to explore more configurations. Maybe changing several parameters at once could lead to a higher reward.

I think a possible next step is to vary multiple states' actions, perhaps setting some to move right and others down in a coordinated way. For example, in the top row, moving right or down, depending on the position, might help avoid holes.

Alternatively, perhaps using a more greedy approach where each state's action leads towards increasing either the row or column index (moving towards the goal) as much as possible.

But given the slipperiness, this isn't straightforward. Each action has a 1/3 chance of moving in one of three directions, so even if the agent chooses to move right, it might end up moving down or left with equal probability.

Maybe another approach is to have states near the goal choose actions that minimize movement away from the goal, while states further away take actions that have a higher chance of moving towards the goal on average.

In summary, I need to propose a new params array where each state's action is chosen to maximize the chances of reaching the goal without falling into holes. Since the previous attempts haven't achieved the desired reward, I'll try a different configuration, possibly changing multiple states' actions to create a more effective path towards the goal.
