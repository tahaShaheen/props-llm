You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 33 out of 5000. OUTPUT ONLY THIS SINGLE LINE:

Do NOT output anything else. No explanation, no reasoning, nothing.



LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with the highest possible reward, avoiding holes. From the problem statement, I know that each action taken in a slippery environment leads to one of three directions randomly. The policy needs to map each state (0-15) to an action (0-3).

First, I look at the top-performing params provided. All their f(params) values are around 0.05, which is far below the target of 1.0. This suggests that the current policies aren't performing well and exploration is needed.

The most recent params tried include a lot where states are mapped to action 1 or 2, but none seem to consistently reach state 15. The trajectories show agents getting stuck in loops or falling into holes quickly.

I need to think about how each policy would navigate. To maximize the chance of reaching 15 without hitting holes, the agent should move towards the right and down directions as much as possible since that's the direction of the goal.

Looking at the action definitions:
- Action 0: down, left, up
- Action 1: right, down, left
- Action 2: up, right, down
- Action 3: left, up, right

Actions 1 and 2 have a higher chance of moving towards the goal since they include right or down directions. So maybe setting more states to choose between these actions would be better.

I should check which states are near the goal and set their policies to actions that increase the chance of moving right or down. For example, state 13 is just above 15; action 2 includes right and down, so choosing action 2 could help move towards 14 or 15.

I also need to ensure that the agent doesn't fall into holes when near them. Maybe setting certain states around the holes to take actions that avoid those positions.

Considering all this, I'll propose a new set of params where each state is assigned an action that either moves right or down as much as possible. This should increase the probability of reaching the goal and thus improve the reward.
