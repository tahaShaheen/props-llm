You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with as high a reward as possible, and the agent can move in four directions but has slippery movement, meaning each action leads to one of three possible moves with equal probability.

From the problem statement, I know that the optimal reward should be around 1.0, which suggests that the policy is either reaching the goal or failing due to holes. The environment has some holes, so the policy needs to avoid them by choosing actions that don't lead into those states.

Looking at the examples provided, it seems like several policies have been tested. The top-performing ones have rewards around 0.45, which is lower than the optimal 1.0. This indicates that there's room for improvement in the current policies.

The recent parameters tried include some with different action selections, but they haven't reached the goal yet. For instance, one of them took a trajectory from state 0 to 3 multiple times without reaching the end, and another kept moving around without success.

I think the key is to design a policy that navigates towards the goal while avoiding holes. Since the environment is slippery, the agent's movement isn't guaranteed, so the policy should account for all possible outcomes of each action. 

Looking at state 15 (the goal), it seems like once the agent gets there, they receive a reward. So states near the bottom right corner might need to have actions that increase the chance of moving towards 15.

I notice that in some policies, certain states are being explored but not leading to success. Maybe adjusting the actions for key states like state 7 (which is on row 2, column 3) or state 4 (row 2, column 0) could help guide the agent more effectively towards the goal.

I should consider changing some of the action selections in states that are close to the goal. For example, if a state near the bottom right has an action that moves away from the goal, switching it to a more goal-oriented direction might improve performance.

Also, considering the slippery nature, the policy should be designed so that even with random movements, there's a high probability of eventually reaching the goal without falling into holes. So perhaps using actions that increase the chances of moving in the correct general direction, even if they don't always land on the desired state.

Looking at the previous policies, some have params[15] set to 3, which might mean an action that can move left or right, depending on the slippery effect. Maybe adjusting this for certain states could prevent falling into holes and increase the chance of reaching the goal.

Overall, I think a good approach is to tweak the actions in key positions to push towards the goal more directly, ensuring that even with the slippery movement, there's a higher probability of success.
