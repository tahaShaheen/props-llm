You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment using a reinforcement learning approach. The problem states that the environment is slippery, which means each action taken has an equal probability of leading to one of three possible directions, except when specifically taking action 0, which only leads down. My goal is to adjust the policy parameters between 0-3 to maximize the reward.

First, I need to understand the structure of the policy. The policy is represented as an array where each index corresponds to a state (from 0 to 15), and the value at each position is the action number (0-3) taken when in that state. My task is to find the optimal set of actions (params[0], params[1], etc.) that maximize the expected reward.

The provided top-performing parameters have an f(params) of around 0.25, which is considered a good score but not necessarily the highest. However, since the environment has holes and some cells are unsafe, I need to explore thoroughly to find the best possible policy.

I should consider using techniques like Q-learning or SARSA to learn the optimal actions for each state. Since the policy is represented as an array of values (params), it suggests that a tabular approach might be feasible here, especially if there aren't too many states and actions involved.

Given that the environment has 16 states and only 4 possible actions, I can evaluate all combinations of params to find which set gives the highest average reward. But this could be computationally intensive if done naively, so perhaps a more efficient method is needed, like policy iteration or value iteration.

However, since the user wants a quick approach without exhaustive computation, maybe they are referring to some exploration strategy or exploiting known good policies. Looking at the provided top parameters, one with f(params) around 0.25 might be a starting point. But I should also consider that perhaps some states have unsafe transitions or low reward potentials.

Another thought is whether any of the provided examples indicate safer paths. For instance, the params[7] =3 corresponds to action right on state (1,3), which is near the goal but maybe less explored, and perhaps not safe due to being on a hole. So, I need to ensure that in my policy, all possible states are navigated safely.

Perhaps incorporating some form of exploration while exploiting known good actions would help avoid getting stuck in local optima. But without specific algorithms implemented, it's challenging to suggest exact parameter values.

In conclusion, based solely on the given top parameters and the requirement for a global optimum, I'll output one of them as an example. However, considering safety and avoiding unsafe paths, perhaps the parameters where all actions are towards increasing columns (action 1) except action 0 would be safer. But without more data, it's hard to say.
