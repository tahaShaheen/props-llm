You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to find the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment using this reinforcement learning approach. The goal is to reach state 15, which is the bottom right corner of the grid. The agent can move up, down, left, or right, but each action has a 2/3 chance when it's not choosing a specific direction.

First, I need to understand how the policy works. Each parameter (params[0] to params[14]) represents the probability of taking action 0 at state i. If params[i] is 0, that means the agent never takes action 0 at state i; it takes one of the other actions with equal probability.

I remember from the examples provided that some parameters lead to a reward of 1, while others don't. The best performing parameter set achieved a reward of 1.00, which is pretty good but not perfect. So I'm looking for parameters that balance action selection well without being too rigid.

Since the environment is slippery, each action has an equal chance when choosing from three options. This means the agent isn't just taking random actions based on the parameters but also considering all possible actions at a state with 1/3 probability each. However, some parameters might enforce more deterministic behavior in certain states.

Looking at the examples given, params[0] being 2 and others vary leads to different behaviors. For instance, when params[0] is 2, it suggests that action 2 (which corresponds to moving up) has a higher probability. This could lead to exploring neighboring states more frequently, which might help in avoiding local optima.

I also notice that some parameters have multiple high values, like several being 3 except for one being low. For example, params[0], [1], [2], [3] are all around 3 except for param[9] being 2 and others varying. This might mean the agent is more likely to take certain actions which could be safer or help in reaching the goal faster.

Considering that the optimal reward is near None, I should aim for parameters that balance risk and reward well. Parameters with higher values like 3 indicate deterministic action selection, while those with lower values (0 or 1) suggest some randomness but perhaps more exploration.

I also think about how state transitions work in this grid. For instance, from state 7 (which is the top right), moving left leads back to state 6. So if an agent takes action 2 from state 7, it might lead to state 6 with certain probabilities, and from there, other actions could be taken.

I should also consider that some states have holes that end the game, so the agent must explore these areas without falling into them. This means the policy needs to avoid revisiting states that are known to be dangerous or lead to future pitfalls.

Given all this, I'll aim for parameters that allow deterministic action selection in certain regions but still enable exploration in other parts of the state space. Maybe having some higher values (like 3) encourage deterministic moves while others have lower values to prevent exhaustive exploration and maintain some uncertainty.
