You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to help find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right corner) and get a reward of +1. All other states give 0 reward, but there are holes that end the episode if stepped on.

First, I need to understand how the slippery nature affects movement. Each action taken by the agent doesn't lead directly to the intended direction but instead has three possible outcomes with equal probability. For example, choosing action 0 (which is supposed to be 'left') can result in moving down, left, or up each with a 1/3 chance.

The policy is represented by an array of 16 elements, each corresponding to a state and indicating the action to take when in that state. My task is to propose values for this array such that the agent maximizes its reward over episodes.

Looking at the provided examples, it seems like the current policies are not performing well since the rewards are around 0.15 or lower. The global optimal should be around 1.0, so we need a policy that can reliably reach state 15 without falling into any holes.

I think the key is to design a policy that navigates towards the goal while avoiding holes. Since the environment is slippery, the agent's path is uncertain, and it might take several steps in different directions before reaching the target. Therefore, the policy should guide the agent in a direction that statistically increases the chances of reaching state 15.

Looking at the trajectories provided, some end quickly (e.g., (0,3) leading to immediate movement towards lower states), while others get stuck or loop around. To avoid holes, the policy must choose actions that minimize the risk of entering those dangerous states.

I recall that in the initial examples, policies that moved right and down more often seemed to have a better chance of reaching the goal. For example, when state 0 is mapped to action 1 (right), it might eventually reach state 3, which is closer to the goal.

Now, considering the current iteration is 142 out of 5000, we've got quite a few iterations left. Since the rewards are still low, we're in the exploration phase rather than exploitation. Therefore, I should propose a policy that explores new paths and avoids previously tried configurations to gather more information.

One approach could be to set all states to choose action 1 (right) or 3 (up), depending on their position. For example, states near the top might prefer moving down, while others move right. However, given the slippery nature, I need to make sure that even with probabilistic movements, the agent can navigate towards state 15.

Alternatively, a policy that encourages movement towards the goal in all cases could be beneficial. Since the grid is 4x4, moving right or down from most states would get closer to the goal.

Looking at the most recent policies, some have many parameters set to 3 (up) and others to 1 (right). To avoid repetition, I'll try a different combination where each state alternates between right and down actions to create a varied path.

I think setting even-numbered states to action 1 (right) and odd-numbered states to action 0 (left might not be ideal due to the slippery nature leading back) or action 3 (up). But since up might lead back, perhaps a better approach is to have all states move right except when near the edges.

Wait, actually, in the initial examples, some policies had params set to 1 and 3. Maybe I should follow that pattern but vary it to ensure we're not repeating previous configurations.

After considering these factors, I'll propose a policy where each state alternates between action 1 (right) and action 2 (up), ensuring movement towards the goal while avoiding holes by reducing direct paths into them.
