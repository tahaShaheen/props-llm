You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 1.0 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[0.0]: W'
    Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around None.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to help this user find the optimal policy in a FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom right corner) and get a reward of +1 for that state. All other states give 0 reward, but there are holes in the map that can trap the agent if it steps on them.

The policy parameters are an array where each element represents the action when in a specific state. The user wants to find the best values for these actions using an array of [params[0], params[1], ..., params[14]] since there are 16 states (0-15).

First, I remember that the policy is represented by these parameters, and each parameter is either 0 or 3. The goal is to set them such that the agent explores efficiently while avoiding dangerous holes.

Looking at the provided examples, some policies haveparams like [2,0,3,2,1,0,...], which means when in state 0, action 2 is taken, etc. These seem to vary widely, suggesting a mix of exploration and exploitation.

I also recall that the environment's slippery nature makes each action pick from three directions equally likely, so the agent doesn't get any bias towards certain actions even if they're better or worse.

The user suggested parameters around [0,1,2,3], so perhaps trying to keep it simple but varied. Maybe mixing 0 and 1 for some states to allow more exploration.

I should consider that in the optimal policy, the agent needs to explore near where the goal is, avoiding holes, while also not getting stuck. So, perhaps using a policy that allows moving around the map as much as possible without repeating the same states too often.

Given the examples provided, some policies have [2,0,3,1], others mix 0 and 1 in different patterns. Maybe trying to avoid certain sequences where the agent gets trapped. For instance, if the agent frequently steps on a hole state, it might get stuck, so avoiding that could be key.

I also think about the fact that some policies haveparams like [2,3,1], which might mean avoiding immediate directions and taking one of the others to explore further. But I'm not sure how that would affect the reward.

Since the user didn't specify any particular hole patterns, maybe trying a more balanced approach where the agent explores different areas without getting stuck is better.

So, considering all this, perhaps choosing [2,1,3,0] as the policy parameters would give a good balance between exploration and exploitation, avoiding holes and efficiently reaching the goal.
