You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) with a reward of +1, avoiding holes along the way. The environment is slippery, meaning each action has a 33% chance of moving in three directions.

Looking at the provided data, all the top-performing policies have an average reward around 0.15, which is much lower than the target of 1.0. This suggests that none of the current policies are consistently reaching the goal state without falling into holes. The most recent policies also show similar low rewards, indicating that the exploration phase might still be ongoing.

Since the rewards are far below the target, I should adopt an exploratory strategy. My aim is to propose a new set of parameters that haven't been tried before to gather more information about which actions lead to success or failure.

I'll start by considering state 15, which should always choose action 3 (since it's already at the goal). For other states, I need to pick actions that increase the chances of moving towards the goal without stepping into holes. 

Looking at the grid:

- State 0: top-left corner. Possible moves are right, down, or up (but up would take it out of bounds, so effectively right and down).
- States near the edges might have limited movement options.

I think a good strategy is to move towards the goal in each state. For example, from state 14 (which is row 3, column 2), moving right takes you to 15. So params[14] should be set to an action that increases the chance of moving right.

Wait, no—the environment's slippery nature complicates things because actions are probabilistic. Each chosen action might lead to different directions with equal probability. Therefore, I need to choose actions that maximize the possibility of eventually reaching the goal without hitting a hole.

For each state, I'll select an action that offers the highest chance of moving towards the goal while avoiding holes. For example:

- State 0 (top-left): possible moves are right or down. Maybe choosing action 1 (right) is better.
- State 1: could move down, left, or up. Choosing down might lead to state 4 or others, but need to check if that's safe.

Wait, perhaps a more systematic approach would help. Let me list each state and the best possible action:

State 0:
Possible actions from other policies have been 1,2,3, etc. Since it's top-left, moving right (action 1) or down (action 0). Need to see which has better success.

But without knowing the hole positions, I can only infer based on trajectories. From the provided examples, some paths end in holes quickly, so maybe certain actions are leading into them.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal policy is one that always tries to move towards the goal, but considering the slippery nature, it's hard to control direction precisely.

Given that all previous policies have low rewards, I'll try a new approach where each state selects an action that primarily moves towards the goal. For example:

- States in row 0: prefer right or down.
- States in column 3 (rightmost): prefer down unless at the bottom.
- Etc.

But without knowing which states are holes, it's tricky. However, since all previous policies have low rewards, I need to try different actions to see what works.

I'll propose a new set of params where each state selects an action that has the highest chance of moving towards the goal. For example:

- State 0: action 1 (right)
- State 1: action 3 (up or right or left—but up might not be helpful, so perhaps down is better? Or maybe action 1 to go right.
Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps a greedy approach where each state chooses the action that directly points towards the goal. For instance:

- From state i, calculate the direction towards 15 and choose an action that best aligns with that direction.

But considering the slippery nature, this might not be straightforward. Each action has three possible outcomes, so choosing actions that have a higher chance of moving in the desired direction is key.

For example, from state 0 (top-left), to reach 15, the agent needs to go right and down. So choosing an action that allows both possibilities could be better. Looking at the available actions for each state:

- Action 0: [down, left, up]
- Action 1: [right, down, left]
- Action 2: [up, right, down]
- Action 3: [left, up, right]

So from state 0 (top-left), action 1 allows moving right or down, which is better than action 0 (which can't go right). Therefore, params[0] should be 1.

Similarly, for state 1 (top-middle left), action 3 might allow more movement towards the goal. Or perhaps action 2 could help move down or right.

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should look at other policies and see if there's a pattern. The top-performing policies seem to alternate between certain actions, but none have achieved high rewards yet.

Given that, I'll try setting params such that each state chooses an action that maximizes the chance of moving towards the goal without hitting holes. For example:

- States in the first row (0-3): prefer right or down.
- Middle states: choose actions that can move towards the bottom-right.

I think a possible new policy could be to set params where each state primarily chooses actions that move towards increasing row and column numbers. So for most states, choosing action 2 or 3 might help in moving towards the goal.

Alternatively, perhaps setting all states except 15 to choose action 2 (which allows up, right, down). But I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at previous policies, some have params set as 3 for multiple states. Maybe that's not effective. Perhaps a better approach is needed.

Given the time constraints and the need to propose a new policy, I'll create a new set where each state chooses an action that primarily moves towards the goal, considering their current position.

For example:

- State 0: action 1 (right)
- State 1: action 3 (up or right or left—but maybe down is better? Or perhaps action 2 to move down or right.
Wait, no—if in state 1 (row 0, column 1), moving right would go to state 2, down to state 4. So choosing action 1 allows moving right, which might be better.

I think I need a more systematic approach, but given the time, I'll propose a new set where each state selects an action that has the highest chance of leading towards the goal, avoiding previously used params as much as possible.
