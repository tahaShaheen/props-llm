You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward by reaching state 15 without falling into any holes. From what's given, the agent has a slippery movement where each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability.

Looking at the top 5 performing params, most of them have a reward around 0.35-0.45, which is significantly below the target of 1.0. This suggests that we're not yet close to the optimal policy, so I should act as an explorer and try new configurations rather than tweaking existing ones.

I notice that in some trajectories, the agent gets stuck or falls into holes because certain states are leading towards them. For example, state 0 (top-left corner) might be moving towards state 1 with action 1, which could lead to a hole. I need to ensure that each state's policy choice doesn't have any chance of falling into a hole.

I recall that in the optimal FrozenLake policy without slipping, the agent would move right from the start (state 0) to get closer to the goal. But with slipping, this becomes more complicated because each action leads to multiple possible states. So, I need to choose actions that, on average, guide the agent towards state 15 while avoiding holes.

Looking at previous params, many have params[0] as 1 or 2, which might be causing the agent to move right or up. However, since slipping can send it in other directions, maybe choosing a different action for certain states could help avoid holes and increase the chance of reaching the goal.

I should consider creating a policy where each state directs the agent towards the general direction of the goal as much as possible. For instance, from state 0, moving right (action 1) might be better than other options because it's the initial step towards the goal. But I have to remember that slipping can take it down or left with equal chance.

Wait, looking at the environment setup again: each action leads to three directions. So for example, action 0 from state 0 (top-left) could lead down, left, or up. Left would go out of bounds, so maybe those are considered as not moving? Or perhaps they wrap around? The problem statement isn't clear on that. Assuming it's the standard FrozenLake setup where moving into walls stays in place.

Given that, I need to make sure each action chosen doesn't have a high probability of leading into a hole when considering all possible movement outcomes.

Looking at the recent params, some had low rewards because they fell into holes. So perhaps changing certain states' actions can prevent this. For example, if state 1 is set to action 3 (right), it might help move towards the goal, but I have to see how slipping affects that.

Another approach is to look for any patterns in the best-performing params and see what they're doing differently. The top param had a reward of 0.45 with certain actions. Maybe I can try variations around those settings to see if we can push the reward higher.

Alternatively, perhaps trying a more aggressive movement towards the goal despite the slipping could work. For example, setting all states that aren't on the last row or column to move right or down as much as possible, considering their action options.

I also notice that some params had trajectories ending early because they fell into holes. So, for each state, I need to ensure that none of the possible movement directions from the chosen action lead into a hole with any probability.

Given that, maybe a more cautious approach is needed. Instead of moving towards the goal blindly, the policy should avoid states known to be holes and their surrounding areas.

Wait, but I don't know where the holes are exactly because they're not specified in the problem statement. The user said we have to explore through previous trajectories to locate them. So from the provided trajectories, I can infer which states might lead to holes.

For example, some trajectories ended quickly when moving into certain directions. Maybe state 0 taking action 1 (right) leads to a hole sometimes. If that's the case, perhaps changing state 0's action to something else would help.

But without knowing the exact hole positions, it's tricky. So maybe I should focus on creating a policy that minimizes the risk of falling into any holes while trying to move towards the goal.

In summary, since we're in the exploration phase (rewards are below 1.0), I need to propose a new set of params that haven't been tried before and could potentially increase the reward by avoiding holes and guiding the agent more effectively towards state 15.
