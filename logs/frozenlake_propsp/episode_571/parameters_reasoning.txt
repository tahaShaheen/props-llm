You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get the highest reward by reaching state 15, but there are holes that can end the episode if stepped on. The agent's movement is slippery because each action leads to three possible directions with equal probability.

Looking at the problem, I need to create a policy where each state (0-15) maps to an action (0-3). The challenge is to avoid holes while trying to reach the goal. From the given examples and trajectories, it seems like some policies aren't effective because they either get stuck in loops or fall into holes.

In the top-performing params, I see that the highest reward was 0.30. That's not very high, so maybe we need a better strategy. The recent attempts have shown that certain policies lead to low rewards, possibly because they're not navigating efficiently or are getting stuck.

I remember that in such grid worlds, the optimal policy often involves moving towards the goal while avoiding dangerous states. So I should structure the policy so that from each state, the agent has a high chance of moving towards 15 without stepping on holes.

Looking at the movement probabilities for each action:
- Action 0 leads to down, left, up.
- Action 1 leads to right, down, left.
- Action 2 leads to up, right, down.
- Action 3 leads to left, up, right.

I need to choose actions that maximize the chance of moving towards the goal (state 15) without hitting any holes. For example, from state 0 (top-left), moving right is better because it's one step closer to the goal. But since the environment is slippery, I have to consider all possible moves.

Wait, in the given examples, some policies are getting stuck or falling into holes. So maybe certain states should be mapped to specific actions that avoid known dangerous areas. For instance, if state 5 is a hole, then from state 4 (which is above it), moving down could lead there, so we might want to avoid that.

But since the problem says I don't know where the holes are exactly, I have to infer based on previous trajectories. From the top examples and recent trials, some states seem to be problematic. For example, in the most recent params, one trajectory fell into a hole after moving right from state 0 multiple times.

So perhaps I should design the policy to move towards the goal while diversifying actions to avoid getting stuck. Maybe using a combination of actions that have a higher chance of progressing towards the goal without directly stepping on holes.

I think a good approach is to make the agent try to go right or down, as those directions are generally towards the goal. But since each action has three possible outcomes, I need to choose an action that covers multiple safe paths.

Looking at state 0: if I set it to move right (action 1), then from state 0, the agent can move right, but also down or left with equal probability. However, moving left would take it back to state 3, which might not be ideal. Alternatively, action 2 could allow moving up, which isn't helpful since it's already at the top.

Wait, actually, state 0 is (0,0), so moving up would keep it in the same place or go out of bounds? No, probably stays in state 0. So maybe from state 0, action 1 (right) is better because it can move right with 1/3 chance to reach state 1.

Similarly, for other states, I need to choose actions that have a higher probability of moving towards the goal while avoiding known holes based on previous trajectories.

From the top examples, some policies are doing better than others. For instance, the first top param had an average reward of 0.30 with a trajectory going (0,1) -> (4,2) -> (8,2). That seems like it's moving towards state 15 but might be taking a long time or hitting holes.

I think to maximize information gain, I should propose a new set of params that explores different paths. Maybe setting certain states to take actions that haven't been tried much before, especially in areas where previous attempts have low rewards.

Given the recent attempts, maybe some policies are getting stuck in loops because they're not exploring enough. So perhaps changing the action for state 0 from 2 or 1 to another option could help. For example, setting it to action 3 might allow more varied movement.

But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, focusing on states near the goal and ensuring their actions lead directly towards it without risk of falling into holes would be crucial.

I think a good strategy is to have the agent try to move right or down as much as possible, but with some variance to avoid getting stuck in loops or falling into holes. Maybe setting up the policy so that each state has a mix of directions that cover multiple safe paths.

Given all this, I'll propose a new set of params where most states are set to actions that push towards the goal (right and down) while avoiding previously problematic choices based on the trajectories provided.
