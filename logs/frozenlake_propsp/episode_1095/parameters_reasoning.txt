You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to get the agent from the starting position (state 0) to state 15, which gives a reward of +1, while avoiding the holes that end the episode with no reward.

First, I need to understand the setup. It's a 4x4 grid where each cell is represented by a number from 0 to 15. The slippery nature means that taking an action can result in moving in one of three directions randomly. So for example, if the agent takes action 0, it might go down, left, or up with equal probability.

Given that the policy is a function mapping each state (0-15) to an action (0-3), I need to determine which actions to take in each state to maximize the reward. The optimal policy should achieve a reward of around 1.0 per episode, meaning it successfully reaches the goal most of the time.

Looking at the provided top 5 best performing policies, they all have average rewards between 0.35 and 0.45. That's significantly below the target of 1.0, so there's room for improvement. The trajectories show that some agents are getting stuck or falling into holes, which suggests that the current policies aren't effectively avoiding hazards.

Since I'm supposed to act as a stateless optimizer, I can't remember previous attempts, but I can try to maximize information gain by suggesting new parameter configurations that haven't been tried before. The goal is to either explore new areas if rewards are low or tweak the best parameters if we're close to optimal.

In this case, since the rewards are below 1.0, especially looking at the recent params with lower rewards (like 0.15 and 0.00), it seems like exploration is still needed. The current policies might not be navigating effectively towards state 15 or aren't avoiding holes properly.

I should think about how to structure the policy so that from each state, the chosen action has a higher chance of moving closer to state 15 while minimizing the risk of falling into holes. Given the slippery nature, it's crucial for the policy to account for possible drifts in direction.

For example, near the goal (state 15), the optimal action would likely be to move right or down since those are the directions towards the goal, but considering the slipperiness, the agent might need to take actions that have a higher chance of moving towards the goal even if there's some probability of drifting.

Looking at state 14 (which is one step away from the goal), the action should probably be right or down. Similarly, for states near the edges or corners, the policy needs to carefully choose actions that avoid the holes.

Since I can't remember previous attempts, I'll try to propose a new set of parameters that might help the agent navigate more effectively towards state 15 while avoiding holes. Maybe adjusting certain key states' actions could lead to better trajectories.

For instance, in state 0 (top-left corner), taking action 3 (which allows moving left, up, or right) might be better because moving right can take it closer to the goal, but I need to ensure that from there, subsequent steps also move towards the goal without falling into holes.

I'll structure my proposal by ensuring that each state's action is chosen to maximize progress toward state 15, considering possible slips. This might involve setting actions that have a higher probability of moving in the desired direction, even if there's some chance of drifting elsewhere.

After considering all these factors, I'll create a new set of params that differ from previous attempts, focusing on states that are critical for reaching the goal while avoiding hazards.
