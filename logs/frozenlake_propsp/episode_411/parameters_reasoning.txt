You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. Let me start by understanding the problem deeply.

First, the environment is a 4x4 grid with states numbered from 0 to 15. The goal is state 15, which gives +1 reward. All other states give 0, except for holes that end the episode immediately.

The tricky part is that the environment is slippery. When an agent takes an action, it has a 33% chance of moving in three directions instead of one. For example, action 0 can lead to down, left, or up with equal probability. This makes planning difficult because the next state isn't deterministic.

The policy is a fixed array of 16 actions (params[0] to params[15]). My goal is to find the optimal set of these actions that maximizes the average reward over episodes.

Looking at the top performing policies, most have an average around 0.2-0.3. The best so far is 0.30, which isn't great. I need to get closer to 1.0, indicating a good policy.

The recent attempts include some with very low rewards (like 0.00), suggesting that those policies are either getting stuck or falling into holes frequently. Others have slightly better but still suboptimal rewards.

I should consider the structure of the grid and the slippery nature. The optimal path likely involves actions that increase the chances of moving towards the goal while avoiding holes.

Let me think about key states:

- State 0: Top-left corner. Possible moves could be right or down, but given the slipperiness, I need to choose an action that gives a higher chance of moving in the desired direction without falling into holes.
  
- States along the edges and near the goal (like state 15) are crucial.

Given the slippery nature, each action should have a mix that allows exploration but also pushes towards the goal. Maybe using a combination of right and down actions to navigate towards the bottom-right.

Wait, but since each action leads to three possible moves, I need to pick actions that, on average, move closer to the goal without stepping into holes.

For example, in state 0 (top-left), moving right or down is better. But considering slipperiness, choosing an action that can go right more often might be beneficial.

Looking at previous policies, some have params[0] as 2 or 3, which correspond to actions that include up/right/down and left/up/right respectively. Maybe these allow for a mix of directions that could help avoid holes while moving towards the goal.

I also notice that in the top performing policies, certain states are being handled with specific actions. For instance, params[15] is often 3, which might be keeping the agent near the goal or not stepping out.

Given that the maximum reward should approach 1.0, I need a policy that reliably reaches state 15 without falling into any holes in most episodes.

Perhaps I can structure the policy to move towards the right and down as much as possible, considering the slippery nature. But how?

Let me consider each state:

- For states near the top, actions should encourage moving down.
- For states on the left side, actions should encourage moving right.
- Avoiding holes means ensuring that from certain states, the chosen action doesn't have a high chance of leading into a hole.

Wait, but without knowing where the holes are exactly, I have to infer based on previous trajectories. From the given top and recent policies, some trajectories end in falls, so I can try to adjust actions to avoid those paths.

For example, if from state 4 (top row), moving down might lead to state 8 or others, but if that's a hole, then choosing an action that avoids it is crucial.

Alternatively, perhaps using a greedy approach where each state's action pushes the agent closer to the goal as much as possible, given the slippery probabilities.

I should also consider that since each action has three possible outcomes, the policy needs to be robust to different paths. So, maybe setting actions in such a way that on average, they move towards the goal without getting stuck.

Looking at the recent policies, some have params[0] as 1 or 3. Maybe trying a different combination could help. For instance, using action 2 for state 0, which allows moving up, right, or down. But I'm not sure if that's better than other options.

I think the key is to maximize the chance of moving towards the goal while minimizing the risk of falling into holes. Since I don't have exact hole positions, I can only infer based on previous trajectories where agents fell into holes.

Perhaps focusing on states near the right and bottom edges to ensure actions push towards state 15 without stepping into known dangerous areas.

Given all this, maybe setting most actions to move right or down, with some flexibility to avoid getting stuck. For example, in state 0, choosing an action that includes moving right (action 3, which allows right, up, or left). But wait, action 3 for state 0 would mean a mix of right, up, and left, which might not be ideal.

Alternatively, action 1 for state 0 allows moving right, down, or left. So, perhaps that's better because it includes both right (desired) and down (also towards the goal). But I'm not sure if that's optimal.

Another approach is to create a deterministic path in the policy but account for the slipperiness by choosing actions that statistically lead towards the goal. For example, always choose the action that has the highest chance of moving right or down.

Wait, but each action has three possible moves. Maybe I can model this as a Markov Decision Process and compute the optimal value function, but given the stateless constraint, I have to propose actions without remembering past trials.

Since my goal is to maximize information gain for the next iteration, perhaps proposing a policy that tests new areas or adjusts based on previous failures.

Looking at the recent policies, one had params[0] as 1 and got a reward of 0.15, another with params[0]=3 gave 0.00, so maybe changing params[0] to 2 could help.

Alternatively, if most top policies have certain patterns, I can tweak those slightly to see if minor changes improve performance.

In the end, considering all these factors, I think setting a policy where each state's action is chosen to encourage movement towards the goal while avoiding likely holes, given the slipperiness, would be best. So, perhaps adjusting some actions in key states to push more towards right and down.
