You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to maximize the reward by reaching state 15 without falling into any holes. From the information given, the environment is a 4x4 grid with slippery moves, meaning each action has three possible outcomes with equal probability.

First, I need to understand how the movement works. Each action (0-3) leads to three different directions. For example, action 0 can lead to down, left, or up. The same goes for other actions, but the specific directions vary based on the action chosen.

The current policies and their rewards show that the best reward achieved so far is around 0.45. Since the global optimal should be around 1.0, we're not there yet. The recent attempts have mostly low rewards, which suggests that the policy isn't effectively navigating towards the goal or avoiding holes.

Looking at the trajectories, many of them end quickly by falling into holes or taking a long time to reach the goal. For example, one trajectory went (0,1) then down to 4,2 and so on, eventually reaching 8,2 but not getting to 15. Another got stuck in a loop near state 0.

Given that I'm supposed to act as an optimizer now since rewards are low but not extremely far from optimal, I should tweak the best parameters slightly. However, without knowing which states are holes, it's tricky. But based on past trajectories, certain moves lead to failures more often.

Looking at the recent params, some have actions that lead towards the edges where holes might be. For instance, state 0 (top-left) being action 1 leads to right, down, or left. If moving left from 0 would take it out of bounds? Wait no, in this setup, I think each move is within grid boundaries but can go into a hole.

Perhaps the best approach is to create a policy that moves towards the goal as much as possible while avoiding edges with holes. Since state 15 is at the bottom-right, moving right and down should be prioritized, but due to slipperiness, we need policies that increase the chance of moving in that direction.

In the previous top params, action 2 was often used for certain states, which allows movement up, right, or down. Maybe adjusting some states to use action 3 could help, as it can move left, up, or right. 

But since I'm supposed to maximize information gain and avoid duplicates, perhaps trying a completely new set of params could uncover new trajectories that either reach the goal faster or reveal more about the holes.

Another approach is to structure the policy so that states closer to the goal have actions that directly move towards it, while other states explore different paths. For example, state 12 (bottom-left) should prefer moving right or down, but considering slipperiness, choosing action 3 might give a higher chance of moving right.

Wait, actually, each action has three possible moves with equal probability. So for any given state and action, the next state is selected from three options. Therefore, to maximize the chance of reaching the goal, we need policies that increase the probability of moving towards it across all possible next states.

Perhaps creating a policy where each state's action leads primarily towards the goal as much as possible. For example:

- States near the top should move down.
- States on the left should move right.
- And so on.

But given the slippery nature, we need to choose actions that have the highest probability of moving in the desired direction across their possible outcomes.

For instance, choosing action 2 (which can move up, right, or down) for a state in the top row might be better because moving down is one of its options, which would help progress towards the goal. Similarly, action 3 allows movement left, up, or right, which could be beneficial on the right side to prevent falling into holes.

Looking at the best previous params, they often use a mix of actions, but perhaps adjusting certain states to prefer actions that have a higher chance of moving right and down when possible.

Given all this, I think the next step is to propose a new set of parameters that guide the agent more directly towards the goal while reducing the chances of falling into holes. Maybe setting some states to action 2 or 3, which have a balance between different directions but include right and down moves.

After considering these factors, here's my proposed params configuration:

params[0]: 1, params[1]: 2, params[2]: 2, params[3]: 3, params[4]: 2, params[5]: 3, params[6]: 2, params[7]: 3, params[8]: 3, params[9]: 3, params[10]: 3, params[11]: 3, params[12]: 3, params[13]: 3, params[14]: 3, params[15]: 3
