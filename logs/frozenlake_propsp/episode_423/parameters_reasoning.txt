You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with the highest possible reward, and I need to avoid the holes along the way.

First, I should understand how the environment works. It's a 4x4 grid, with each cell representing a state from 0 to 15. Moving actions are slippery, meaning when you choose an action, there's a 33% chance of going in one of three directions. So, for example, choosing action 0 might take me down, left, or up.

The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers (params[0] to params[15]), each indicating the action to take when in that state. The reward is +1 only if I reach state 15, and 0 otherwise, except for falling into a hole which ends the episode immediately.

Looking at the provided data, the best-performing policies so far have f(params) around 0.30, but the goal is to get close to 1.0. That suggests that current policies are not consistently reaching the goal without falling into holes.

I notice that some trajectories end quickly because they fall into holes. For example, one trajectory went (0,1) → (4,2) → (8,2), which might have ended there if it's a hole or didn't reach 15. Another trajectory got stuck in loops, like (0,3) moving around and not making progress towards the goal.

To improve, I need to design a policy that, from any state, chooses actions that increase the probability of reaching state 15 while avoiding holes. Since the environment is slippery, each action choice must consider all possible outcomes.

I think about the structure of the grid. The optimal path would likely involve moving right and down towards state 15. However, due to slipperiness, sometimes you might move in unintended directions. So, I should ensure that from any state, the chosen action has a high probability of eventually leading towards the goal.

For example, starting at state 0 (top-left corner), choosing an action that generally moves right or down would be better. But since the environment is slippery, each action choice must cover all possible outcomes to avoid holes.

Looking at previous policies, some had params set to move in certain directions but ended up in loops or hitting holes. To break these patterns, I should vary the actions more strategically across different states.

I also need to consider that each state's policy affects the overall path. For instance, state 15 is the goal and should stay there if reached, but since it's terminal, maybe params[15] can be irrelevant as reaching it ends the episode.

To explore further, I might change some policies in states near the holes to avoid them. For example, in states adjacent to holes, choosing actions that have a higher chance of moving away from the hole.

Given that the current best reward is around 0.30, which is significantly below 1.0, it's crucial to explore more effectively. Maybe adjusting certain state actions to encourage exploration towards the goal while minimizing risks of falling into holes.

I'll try to create a new policy where each state has an action that generally moves towards the right or down but also accounts for the possible slip directions. This might involve setting actions that, when considering all possible outcomes, have a higher likelihood of moving closer to 15 without hitting any holes.

For instance, in state 0 (top-left), choosing action 1 could lead to moving right, left, or down. But since we want to move towards the goal, perhaps action 2 would be better as it includes moving up, right, or down—though I need to check the exact directions each action leads.

Wait, let me clarify the action definitions:

- Action 0: [down, left, up]
- Action 1: [right, down, left]
- Action 2: [up, right, down]
- Action 3: [left, up, right]

So, from state 0 (top-left), choosing action 0 would have a chance to move down or left, which might not be ideal. Instead, action 1 could move right, which is towards the goal, but also has a chance to move down or left.

Alternatively, action 2 from state 0 would allow moving up (which isn't possible as it's the top row), so it would go down or right. Similarly, action 3 might not be helpful as it includes left and up, which could lead away.

So, perhaps choosing action 1 for state 0 is better because it has a chance to move right towards the goal.

I'll apply this reasoning across each state. For states closer to the goal, choose actions that have higher probabilities of moving towards the goal while avoiding holes. For states near holes, adjust actions to minimize falling into them.

After considering all these factors, I'll propose a new set of params where each state's action is chosen to maximize the chance of reaching 15 without hitting any holes, based on the slipperiness and possible movement outcomes.
