You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, let's try to figure out the best next step for the FrozenLake environment problem. The goal is to find a policy that optimizes the episodic reward by reaching state 15 without falling into any holes. 

First, looking at the information provided, the top-performing policies have an average reward around 0.45. This suggests that while some progress is being made towards the goal, there's still room for improvement. The global optimal should be around 1.0, so we need to aim higher.

The environment is slippery, meaning each action leads to a random direction with equal probability. So, planning deterministic paths isn't straightforward because the agent can't fully control its next state based on actions alone. This adds uncertainty, and the policy must account for that by choosing actions that statistically lead towards the goal while avoiding holes.

Looking at the recent policies and their trajectories, it seems some states are getting stuck or leading into loops. For example, in one trajectory, the agent keeps moving between a few states without making progress toward state 15. This indicates that some of the current policies might not be efficiently exploring the environment or aren't correctly navigating around holes.

Since we're supposed to maximize information gain and explore vs exploit based on the rewards, and given that the rewards are still below 0.5 (far from 1.0), it's better to act as an "Explorer" rather than an "Optimizer." This means proposing a new parameter configuration that hasn't been tried before, particularly focusing on states near the goal or those that might have led to falls in previous attempts.

I should consider which states are most critical for reaching the goal and avoiding holes. The states leading up to state 15 (like 12, 13, 14) and their surrounding areas are crucial. For instance, state 14 can move right to reach the goal or might fall into a hole if not careful.

Looking at the recent policies, some have params[14] set to 3. Maybe trying different actions for certain states could help. Alternatively, perhaps adjusting the policy in key positions like near the bottom row (states 12-15) can lead to better outcomes.

I should also consider how each action affects the possible next states. For example, if state 14's current action leads to a mix of right (to goal), down, and left moves, perhaps changing it to prioritize an action that has a higher chance of moving towards the goal could help.

Another thought: maybe certain actions in specific states are causing the agent to loop or get stuck. For example, if state 12's action leads back up instead of right or down, that might be counterproductive. Adjusting this could allow the agent to move closer to the goal.

I need to ensure that each proposed parameter change is distinct from previous ones and targets areas where improvement can be made based on the trajectories provided. By doing so, we can gather more information about which actions lead to success or failure, allowing future iterations to refine the policy further.

So, for the next iteration, I'll propose a new set of params that adjust some key states, particularly those near the goal and in areas where previous policies have led to lower rewards. This should help in exploring new paths and potentially avoiding holes while moving towards state 15.
