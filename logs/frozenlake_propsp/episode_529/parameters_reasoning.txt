You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. It's a 4x4 grid where the agent moves around, and there are holes that can end the episode if stepped on. The goal is state 15, which gives a reward of +1, while all other states give 0.

From the problem description, I understand that each action has three possible directions with equal probability due to the slippery nature of the environment. So, for example, choosing action 0 can lead to down, left, or up with 1/3 chance each.

The policy is a list of 16 actions (params[0] to params[15]), where each element is an integer from 0 to 3 representing the action taken in that state. The challenge is to find the optimal set of these parameters to maximize the episodic reward, which should ideally be around 1.0.

Looking at the provided data, I see several top-performing policies and their rewards. Most have f(params) between 0.20 and 0.30, indicating that the current best policies aren't consistently reaching the goal. The goal is to get closer to 1.0, so we need to improve these policies.

The recent params tried include some with low rewards (like 0.00), which suggests that those might be either exploratory or not effective. Since I'm supposed to act as a stateless optimizer, I need to focus on the most recent information without remembering past steps.

In the most recent iteration (params[0]:2;...;f(params):0.00), the policy didn't yield any reward. This might mean that the agent either fell into a hole or took a path that didn't lead to the goal. To improve, I should consider adjusting the actions in key states to increase the chances of reaching state 15.

I notice that some policies are designed to move towards the goal by choosing specific actions that could navigate around holes. For instance, if state 0 (top-left) has action 2, which is right, but considering the slippery nature, it might actually go down or up with equal chance. Alternatively, maybe choosing a different action from certain states can lead the agent towards safer paths.

Since I'm supposed to propose new params without repeating previous ones and maximize information gain, I'll need to vary the actions in critical states like those near the goal or near holes.

Let me consider state 15 as the target. From state 14 (which is directly above 15), taking action right would lead to 15 with some probability. Similarly, from state 11, moving down could reach 15 if the environment allows it.

But since actions are slippery, I need to choose actions that have a higher chance of eventually leading towards 15 without falling into holes. For example, in state 12 (third row, first column), choosing action right might help move towards 13, 14, and then 15.

Looking at the previous policies, many have params[0] as 2 or 1, which suggests moving right or down from the start. But since the environment is slippery, maybe I should choose actions that have a higher probability of moving in the desired direction.

Wait, each action has three possible moves with equal chance. So for example, choosing action 3 (which can move left, up, or right) might be useful in certain states to increase the chances of moving towards the goal without falling into holes.

I think I'll need to adjust several key states. For instance:

- State 0: Maybe choose an action that tends to move right or down.
- States near the bottom-right (like 12,13,14) should have actions that push towards 15.
- Avoiding holes by choosing safe paths.

Given that, I'll propose a new set of params where:

- For states in the third row (8-11), choose actions that move down or right to approach state 15.
- In states that are near the bottom-right, ensure that actions have a high chance of moving towards 15.

But without knowing the exact positions of the holes, it's tricky. However, based on previous trajectories, I can infer which states might be dangerous and adjust accordingly.

After considering these factors, I'll create a new params array where each state's action is chosen to either move directly towards 15 or choose an action that has a higher probability of eventually reaching the goal while avoiding holes.
