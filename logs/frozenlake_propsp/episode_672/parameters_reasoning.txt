You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out what the best policy is for this FrozenLake environment. So, from what I understand, it's a 4x4 grid where each state has some probability of moving in different directions due to being slippery. The goal is to reach state 15, which gives a reward of +1. There are holes that end the episode if stepped on.

Looking at the provided examples and trajectories, the best performing policies have f(params) around 0.35, but I know the global optimal should be closer to 1.0. So, maybe there's a better policy that can reach the goal more reliably.

The key here is to avoid the holes while moving towards state 15. Let me think about the layout of the grid. The top-left corner is state 0, and it goes right as we move along the row. Holes are probably placed in some positions; I need to make sure that the policy doesn't lead into those.

From the trajectories provided, when the agent takes certain actions, it either falls into a hole or reaches the goal. For example, one trajectory went (0,1) → (4,2) → (8,2), which ended without reaching 15. Another just fell into a hole quickly.

I think the best approach is to have policies that move towards the right and down as much as possible since the goal is at the bottom-right corner. However, because of the slippery nature, the agent might slide in different directions, so we need actions that maximize the chances of getting closer despite this.

Looking at the previous params, many have action 1 or 3 for state 0. Let me consider what each action does:

- Action 0: Move down, left, up with equal probability.
- Action 1: Move right, down, left equally.
- Action 2: Move up, right, down equally.
- Action 3: Move left, up, right equally.

If the agent is at state 0 (top-left), choosing action 1 would try to move right. But since it's slippery, there's a chance to go down or left as well. Maybe action 1 isn't the best because going left from 0 is bad—it takes you back to 0 or maybe into a hole.

Alternatively, action 3 for state 0 might be better. Action 3 allows moving left, up, or right. But since it's at the top-left corner, moving up would take it out of bounds, so effectively, it can go right or left (but left is bad) or down. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe I should map all possible moves for each state and see which actions lead towards the goal without hitting holes.

For example, let's consider states near the goal:

- State 14: To reach 15, you need to move right. But since it's slippery, taking action that includes moving right might help.
- Similarly, state 12 is directly above 15; moving down would get there, but if it's slippery, perhaps moving right or up could be better.

But without knowing the exact positions of the holes, I need to infer based on previous trajectories. From the provided data, some states lead to immediate falls into holes, so we should avoid actions that have a high probability of leading to those states.

Looking at the recent params, one had all 0s and ended up in a hole after several steps. So maybe setting certain states to specific actions can prevent getting stuck.

I think the optimal policy needs to minimize the chance of falling into holes while maximizing the chance of reaching state 15. To do that, each action should be chosen such that even with the slippery movement, it's more likely to head towards the goal or stay on safe paths.

Perhaps a strategy where from each state, the agent tries to move right or down as much as possible, given the probabilities. So for states in higher rows and columns, prioritize moving right or down.

For example:

- In the first row (states 0-3), focus on moving right.
- In the second row (4-7), perhaps move down when possible.
- In the third row (8-11), again move right or down towards state 15.

But since actions are probabilistic, we need to pick the action that gives the highest chance of moving in the desired direction. For instance, choosing an action that includes more right and down moves would be better.

Looking back at the previous best params, which had a reward of 0.35, maybe tweaking some states' actions could lead to higher rewards.

I think I need to adjust certain states to choose different actions that avoid holes and guide towards the goal. For example, in state 1 (top-middle), instead of action 3, perhaps choosing action 2 or 0 could help move downward more effectively.

But since I'm supposed to output a single line with params values without any explanation, I'll proceed based on this reasoning, focusing on setting actions that push towards the goal and avoiding holes.
