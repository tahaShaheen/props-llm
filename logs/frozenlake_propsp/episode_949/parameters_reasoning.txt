You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with a reward of +1, and all other states give 0 except for the holes which end the episode immediately.

First, let's understand the setup. It's a 4x4 grid where each cell represents a state from 0 to 15. The agent can move in four directions, but because it's slippery, each action leads to one of three possible moves with equal probability. For example, choosing action 0 (left) might result in down, left, or up.

The policy is defined by an array params where each element corresponds to the action taken from that state. My task is to find the optimal set of actions across all states to maximize the reward.

Looking at the top 6 best performing policies provided, I notice they have varying f(params) values around 0.35-0.45. The trajectories show paths like (0,1) leading to (4,2), which then goes to 8,2 and so on. It seems that getting stuck in certain loops or not reaching the goal quickly is common.

The recent params provided have lower rewards, around 0.05-0.20, suggesting that those policies aren't effective. So maybe I should look at the top ones for better guidance.

I need to consider how each action from a state leads the agent towards the goal without falling into holes. Holes are states that end the episode immediately, so avoiding them is crucial.

From state 15 (goal), no action is needed since it's terminal. For other states near the bottom right, actions should push towards state 15. For example, from state 14, moving right would get to 15, but considering the slippery nature, maybe moving up or right could help.

Looking at the policies in the top, I see that some have a pattern of choosing specific actions in certain states. However, without knowing where the holes are exactly, it's challenging to decide which paths are safe.

I think a possible approach is to set actions that generally move towards the goal (right and down) from the upper left areas. But because of the slippery nature, sometimes moving in other directions might be safer or necessary to avoid holes.

Given that the highest reward so far is around 0.45, which is less than the target of 1.0, there's room for improvement. So perhaps I need to find a policy that can navigate more efficiently and reliably towards state 15 without getting stuck in loops or falling into holes.

I'll consider setting actions from states near the goal (like 12, 13, 14) to move right or down as applicable. For example:

- State 12: Maybe action 0 (left) is bad because moving left would take it back. Instead, perhaps action 2 or 3 to try and go up or right.
Wait, but from state 12, which is the bottom row's first cell, moving down isn't possible. So actions should be towards right or up.

But I'm not sure about the hole positions, so it's tricky. Maybe I can set a policy where each state encourages movement towards the goal, considering possible slips.

Another thought: maybe setting some states to always move in one direction and others to vary could help. For example, from state 0 (top-left), choosing action 1 might lead to right, down, or left, but if the agent is on the edge, certain actions would be safer.

Since I can't remember previous attempts, each suggestion has to be a new configuration that's as informative as possible for future iterations. Therefore, I should propose a params array that tries different action patterns in key states, especially those near the goal or potential holes.

After considering all this, I think setting up actions in such a way that from each state, there's a higher chance to move towards the goal while avoiding edges where holes might be located would be optimal. So here's my proposed params array.

params[0]: 1, params[1]: 3, params[2]: 1, params[3]: 3, params[4]: 0, params[5]: 1, params[6]: 1, params[7]: 2, params[8]: 3, params[9]: 1, params[10]: 2, params[11]: 3, params[12]: 1, params[13]: 3, params[14]: 2, params[15]: 3
