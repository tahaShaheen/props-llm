You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I need to help find the global optimal policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15 with a reward of +1, avoiding holes along the way. The policy is defined by an array of 16 actions (0-3) for each state.

First, I should understand the problem thoroughly. The grid is 4x4, so states are numbered from 0 to 15. Each action taken has a 1/3 chance to go in three directions due to slipperiness. Some states are holes that end the episode immediately.

The current top-performing policies aren't doing well; their rewards are around 0.25 or lower. The best so far is 0.25, which is much below the target of 1.0. This suggests that the policies aren't effectively navigating towards the goal without falling into holes.

Looking at the trajectories provided, many end quickly in holes or get stuck in loops without reaching the goal. For example, some trajectories show repeated actions leading to the same state or immediate falls into holes.

To improve, I need to design a policy that navigates towards state 15 while avoiding known holes. Since the agent's actions are probabilistic, the policy should choose actions that maximize the chance of moving towards the goal without risking falling into holes.

I'll start by identifying safe paths from each state to the goal (state 15). For example:

- From state 0 (top-left), moving right or down might be safer.
- From state 14 (third row, third column), moving right leads directly to state 15.

But since actions are slippery and have multiple possible outcomes, the policy needs to choose actions that statistically lead towards the goal while avoiding risky moves.

Looking at the recent policies, some seem to get stuck or fall into holes. I need to propose a new set of parameters that avoids these pitfalls. For example, if state 12 is a hole, then from states leading to it (like 8 and 9), the policy should avoid actions that might lead there.

I'll consider setting up policies where each state encourages movement towards higher-numbered states, as they are closer to the goal. However, I must ensure that from any given state, the chosen action doesn't have a high probability of leading into a hole.

For instance, in state 12 (which is a hole), we need to avoid staying there. So, from state 8 (third row, first column), actions should be towards right or up if possible. But since it's slippery, the agent might drift elsewhere.

I'll draft a policy where each state's action is chosen to move towards increasing numbers as much as possible, avoiding states known to be holes. For example:

- From state 0: choose down (action 0) which can lead to state 4 or 1 or 3.
- From state 1: choose right (action 1) leading towards higher states.
- Continue this pattern, ensuring each action pushes the agent towards the goal.

However, since some actions are risky due to holes, I'll need to adjust. For example, if a particular state has a high chance of falling into a hole when taking an action, that action should be avoided in favor of another.

After considering all these factors, I'll propose a new set of params where each state's action is chosen strategically to move towards the goal while minimizing the risk of falling into holes. This might involve testing different actions and seeing which trajectories lead to success without failure.
