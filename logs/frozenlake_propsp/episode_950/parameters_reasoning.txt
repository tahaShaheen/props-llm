You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best policy for this FrozenLake environment. The goal is to reach state 15, which gives a reward of +1, while avoiding holes that end the episode. The environment is slippery, meaning each action has three possible outcomes with equal probability.

Looking at the provided information, the top-performing policies have an average reward around 0.45, which is significantly below the target of 1.0. This suggests we're not yet optimized. My task is to propose a new set of params that could potentially improve the reward.

I need to consider how each state's action choice affects the probability of reaching the goal without falling into holes. Since the environment is slippery, it's crucial for each policy to choose actions that maximize the chance of moving towards the goal while minimizing the risk of hitting a hole.

From the trajectories provided, some policies seem to get stuck or fall into loops. For example, one trajectory went (0,1) → (4,2) → (8,2), which might not be the most efficient path. Another got stuck in state 0 repeatedly, indicating a possible loop or ineffective action choices.

I should focus on states near the goal and ensure that their policies guide the agent towards it. For instance, state 14 is just one step away from the goal (state 15). So, for state 14, the optimal action would be to move right (action 0, which has a 33% chance of moving down, left, or up—wait, no, looking back, each action leads to three possible moves. Wait, correction: when taking an action, it's split into three directions.

Wait, let me clarify the movement:

- Action 0: move down, left, up.
- Action 1: move right, down, left.
- Action 2: move up, right, down.
- Action 3: move left, up, right.

So each action has a 1/3 chance of moving in one of three directions. For state 14 (which is at position (3,1)), the goal is to reach state 15 (position (3,2)). So from state 14, taking an action that increases the column index would be better.

Looking at action options for each state:

- If in state 14 (row 3, column 1), possible actions:
  - Action 0: can move down (to 15?), but wait, row is already maxed. Wait, the grid is 4x4 with states 0-15, where 0 is top-left (0,0) and 15 is bottom-right (3,3). So state 14 is (3,2), actually? Wait no, let's map it correctly.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify the grid:

Rows are 0 (top) to 3 (bottom). Columns 0 (left) to 3 (right).

So state numbering: row major order.

- State 0: (0,0)
- State 1: (0,1)
- ...
- State 3: (0,3)
- State 4: (1,0)
- ...
- State 7: (1,3)
- State 8: (2,0)
- ...
- State 11: (2,3)
- State 12: (3,0)
- ...
- State 15: (3,3)

So state 14 is (3,2), and the goal is 15 at (3,3). So from state 14, moving right would reach the goal. But since each action has a 1/3 chance of moving in three directions.

Looking at action options for state 14:

Possible actions are determined by the policy's params[14]. The agent wants to increase the column index (move right or up? Wait, no—state is (row, column). From (3,2), moving right would go to (3,3) which is goal. So action that has a higher chance of moving right.

Looking at each action's possible moves:

- Action 0: down, left, up → from state 14 (3,2), moving down isn't possible (row 3 is bottom). Left would go to (3,1), and up would go to (2,2).
- Action 1: right, down, left → right goes to goal (3,3), down can't move further, left goes to (3,1).
- Action 2: up, right, down → same as action 0 in terms of movement.
- Action 3: left, up, right → similar to others.

So for state 14, choosing actions that have a higher probability of moving right would be best. Looking at the possible actions:

Action 1 has a 1/3 chance to move right (to goal), while action 3 also has a 1/3 chance to move right. So perhaps choosing between these.

Wait, but looking back at previous policies, some have params[14] set to 2 or 3. For example, in the top-performing policy, params[14] was 2, which might not be optimal if a different action could yield a higher chance of moving right.

Alternatively, perhaps setting state 14's action to 1 (which includes right as one of three options) is better than others. Similarly, state 13 is at (3,1), so from there, moving up or right might help.

Looking at the trajectories, some agents get stuck in loops because their policies don't guide them towards the goal effectively. So perhaps adjusting certain states' actions to prioritize right or down movements could help reach the goal faster.

Also, considering holes: I need to ensure that the chosen policy doesn't lead the agent into any holes. From the problem description, it seems that some states are holes, but their exact locations aren't specified except through trajectories where agents fall in.

To maximize information gain, since we're in iteration 950 and rewards are still around 0.45, which is below the target of 1.0, I should act as an Explorer and choose a new set of params that haven't been tried before to gather more data.

Looking at the previous params provided, they seem to have certain patterns. For example, many have params[0] = 1 or 2. Maybe trying a different approach for state 0 could help.

I'll need to adjust several key states:

- State 0 (0,0): want to move towards the goal. Possible actions: right or down.
Looking at action options:
- Action 0: down, left, up → from (0,0), moving down leads to state 4, which is (1,0). Left would be impossible as it's already on the edge. Up is also impossible.
- Action 1: right, down, left → right takes to state 1, down to 4, left not possible.
So perhaps setting params[0] to 1 (action 1) which allows moving right or down.

Similarly for other states near the edges.

But without knowing hole positions, it's tricky. So I'll have to make educated guesses based on trajectories.

Alternatively, another approach is to set all policies to move towards the goal as much as possible. For example:

- States in row 3 (bottom row) should prioritize moving right.
- States in column 3 (rightmost column) should prioritize moving down.

Wait, no—since the goal is at (3,3), so from any state not in that position, the agent should try to move towards increasing row and column indices.

But considering the slippery nature, each action only gives a 1/3 chance of moving in each direction. So perhaps setting policies that have a higher probability of moving towards the goal.

For example:

- For states where row < 3: prefer actions that increase the row (down) or column (right).
- For states where column < 3: prefer right movement.

But since each action has three possible moves, it's about choosing which action gives the best chance to move in the desired direction.

Alternatively, perhaps a more systematic approach is needed. Since I can't remember previous attempts, I need to generate a new set of params that might explore different paths.

Looking at the most recent 5 params, they seem to have varying actions but low rewards. Maybe trying a completely different set for key states could help.

I'll try setting certain states to specific actions:

- State 0: action 1 (right and down)
- States along the top row (0-3): encourage moving right or down
- Middle rows: move towards increasing row and column
- Bottom row (states 12-15): prioritize moving right

But without knowing hole positions, it's hard to avoid them. So perhaps focusing on getting to the goal as quickly as possible is better.

In conclusion, I'll propose a new set of params where:

- States closer to the goal have actions that increase the chance of moving towards it.
- Avoid repeating previous params to ensure exploration.
