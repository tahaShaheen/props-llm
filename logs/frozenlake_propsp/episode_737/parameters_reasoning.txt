You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, let's try to figure out how to propose the next set of parameters for the FrozenLake environment based on the given information. 

First, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. The goal is to reach state 15 (the bottom-right corner) in a 4x4 grid with slippery movements and some holes. Each action taken by the agent has a probability of moving in three directions. The policy is defined by an array of 16 integers, each representing the action taken in a specific state.

Looking at the examples provided, the best performing policies so far have f(params) values around 0.45 to 0.25. Since the optimal reward should be close to 1.0, it suggests that these policies aren't yet achieving the goal consistently. This means we're still in an exploration phase because the rewards are significantly below the target.

The most recent parameters have f(params) values as low as 0.00 and up to 0.10, which is quite poor. Therefore, the strategy should focus on exploring new configurations rather than optimizing existing ones that aren't performing well enough.

I need to propose a set of params that hasn't been tried before. From the top 6 best-performing params provided, I can see some patterns. For example, state 0 often has action 1 or 2. Let's look at those examples:

- One param had params[0] as 1, leading to a trajectory starting with (0,1) and then moving down.
- Another had params[0] as 2, which might be exploring upwards.

I should avoid repeating these configurations. Instead, maybe try setting params[0] to action 3, which hasn't been tried much yet in the top examples. Action 3 for state 0 could encourage movement right, left, or up, potentially avoiding holes and making progress towards the goal.

Looking at other states, I'll aim to set actions that generally move the agent closer to the goal (state 15). For example, from state 0 (top-left), moving down leads to state 4. From there, moving right could lead to state 5, which is still in row 2 but column 1. But considering the slippery nature, it's better to set actions that have a higher chance of moving towards the goal.

I also need to ensure that the policy doesn't step into any holes. Based on the trajectories provided, some states are near holes, so I should check which actions might lead away from those. For instance, in state 3 (top-right), action 1 is taken in some examples. Action 1 can move left, down, or right. If the hole is to the right, then moving right would be dangerous. So perhaps setting a different action here.

But without knowing exactly where the holes are, it's tricky. However, I can infer from the trajectories that certain paths lead to holes or goals. For example, state 0 taking action 1 leads to state 4 (down), which is generally safe, but sometimes ends up in other states depending on the slippery movement.

I'll proceed by proposing a new set of params where each state's action is chosen to either move directly towards the goal or avoid obvious pitfalls. For example:

- State 0: Action 1 (move down, left, up). Moving down takes it closer to the bottom.
- States near the edges should be cautious about their actions to prevent falling into holes.

After considering these factors, I'll draft a new set of params that differ from previous attempts, focusing on moving towards the goal while avoiding risky moves. Here's one such configuration:

params[0]: 3, params[1]: 2, params[2]: 0, params[3]: 2, params[4]: 3, params[5]: 1, params[6]: 2, params[7]: 3, params[8]: 0, params[9]: 1, params[10]: 3, params[11]: 2, params[12]: 0, params[13]: 1, params[14]: 3, params[15]: 2
