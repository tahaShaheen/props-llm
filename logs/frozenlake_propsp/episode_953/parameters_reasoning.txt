You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left, down, right, or up. 
The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. 
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid), which will yield a +1 reward. All other states yield a reward of 0. However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 16 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth. The agent should locate the wholes via previous explored trajectiores and pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the wholes.

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from [0, 1, 2, 3].
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (5000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[15]: W'
   Propose params values from [0, 1, 2, 3]. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over 20 episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around 1.0.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below 1.0, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to 1.0, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal. 
You will see up to 10 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help optimize the policy for the FrozenLake environment. The goal is to find a global optimal policy that maximizes the episodic reward by reaching state 15 without falling into any holes. 

From the problem description, the environment is 4x4 grid with slippery movements. Each action taken has three possible outcomes with equal probability. So, for each state, taking an action doesn't guarantee moving in a specific direction—it could go down, left, up, etc., depending on the action chosen.

Looking at the provided trajectories and their rewards, I notice that most policies are giving low rewards around 0.25 to 0.45. The best so far is 0.45, but the target is 1.0, which suggests that there's room for improvement.

I need to figure out what changes can lead to a higher reward. Let me analyze some of the top-performing policies and their trajectories. 

One common pattern I see is that many policies are getting stuck in loops or not effectively navigating towards the goal state 15. For example, some trajectories show repeated actions leading to the same states without progress. This indicates that the current policies might not be avoiding holes effectively or aren't taking optimal paths.

I should consider how each policy's actions influence the next steps. Since the environment is slippery, choosing an action that increases the chances of moving towards the goal while minimizing the risk of falling into a hole is crucial. 

Looking at state 0 (top-left corner), if the agent takes action 1, it might move right, down, or left with equal probability. But since we want to go towards the goal, perhaps moving right is better. However, due to slipperiness, it's possible that other directions are taken. 

For state 15 (the goal), it should be a terminal state where the agent stops, but in our case, the policy doesn't need to change once it reaches 15.

I think one approach is to design a policy that pushes the agent towards the right and down directions as much as possible, given the slippery nature. For example, in states near the top-left, choosing actions that encourage moving right or down might help navigate towards the goal.

Let me outline potential changes:

1. **State 0 (params[0])**: Currently, some policies have action 1 or 2. Maybe trying a different action could lead to better progress.
2. **States near the top**: Encourage moving right to stay on track towards state 3 and then down.
3. **States in the middle rows**: Ensure that actions guide towards the bottom-right without getting stuck.

I'll also consider previous policies. For example, if a policy leads to state 4 (which is in the second row), choosing action 0 might send it down further or left/right, but perhaps action 2 would be better to move up or right.

Another consideration is avoiding holes. The trajectories show that some states are leading into loops or falling into holes, so I need to adjust actions to avoid those paths.

Perhaps a more aggressive approach towards the goal by choosing actions that have higher probabilities of moving towards it despite the slipperiness could work. For example, in state 0, taking action 2 (which can move up, right, down) might give a better chance to go right or down.

Let me try constructing a new policy where each state is mapped to an action that has the highest probability of moving towards the goal, considering the slipperiness. For states near the top-left, prioritize actions that have a higher chance of moving right or down. In other states, choose actions that move closer to the goal.

After analyzing, I'll create a new set of params where each state's action is selected based on maximizing the probability of reaching the goal while avoiding holes.
