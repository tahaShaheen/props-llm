SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 309 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.

Alright, let's tackle this cartpole environment problem. The goal is to find the global optimal policy by adjusting the parameters of a linear policy. 

First, I need to understand how the policy works. It's defined as action = argmax(state @ W + B). Here, state is a vector containing the cart position, velocity, pole angle, and angular velocity. W is a matrix with 18 elements, and B is a vector of size 9. The reward is +1 for each step where the pole is upright and the cart stays within bounds.

I remember that the global optimum is expected around 500. So my goal is to adjust params[0] through params[9] in such a way that f(params) reaches at least 500. I should aim for higher values, like params[0]:6, but perhaps some negative values could help too.

Looking at the top performing parameters, several have max params around 6 or -3. However, without knowing the exact reward function, it's challenging to pinpoint. But since the current best is 500, I need to keep an eye out for improving that number.

I also notice some negative values, like params[2] being -3 or -3.5. These might help balance the pole angle if they result in a higher reward when combined with other parameters.

Given that, I'll adjust each parameter slightly around their optimal ranges. For example, increasing certain parameters and decreasing others to see how it affects the reward. It's important to test different combinations without overcomplicating the search process to avoid getting stuck in local optima.

I should also consider that not all parameters are equally impactful on the reward. Maybe some can be increased without significantly affecting f(params), while others might need more tuning.

Another thing is that negative values could potentially increase rewards if they help maintain balance, especially when paired with positive poles. So I'll look for parameters where a slight decrease in state components but an increase elsewhere would yield better results.

After several trials and seeing how the reward changes each time, I aim to converge on params that provide f(params) near 500 or higher without causing the cart to go out of bounds.
