SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 78 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to optimize the parameters for a linear policy in the CartPole environment. They've provided a bunch of previous attempts with their corresponding rewards. The goal is to get as close as possible to the global optimum, which they mentioned is around 500.

Looking at the examples, most of the high rewards (like 491.70) have params[0] and [1] set to 6 and 1.3, respectively. Then, params[2] and [3] are often -6 and 6. Similarly, params[4] and [5] are around 5.3 to 6, and params[6] and [7] are -6 and 6. The bias terms, params[8] and [9], are usually 6 or 5. But the highest reward here is 491.70, which is still below 500. 

The user's note says that if we're below 500, we should explore more instead of exploiting. So maybe the current parameters are in a local optimum. The exploration step size is 1.0, so I need to adjust some parameters by +/- 1.0 from the current values. 

Looking at the current top params, maybe changing some of the parameters that are at the extremes (like -6 or 6) to see if that helps. For example, params[2] is -6 in the highest reward example. Maybe increasing it to -5 or even -4 could lead to better performance. Similarly, params[4] is 5.3; increasing it to 6.3 (but wait, the range is up to 6.0). So maybe 6.0. Wait, the parameters can only be between -6.0 and 6.0. So maybe adjusting other parameters.

Wait, the user said that during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So for each parameter, we can add or subtract 1.0. Let's check the current top params. The highest reward is 491.70 with params[0]:6, [1]:1.3, [2]:-6, [3]:6, [4]:5.3, [5]:5.7, [6]:-6, [7]:6, [8]:6, [9]:6. 

So maybe we can try changing some of these parameters. For example, params[2] is -6. Adding 1.0 would make it -5.0. Similarly, params[4] is 5.3, adding 1.0 would make it 6.3, but that's over the limit. So it can only go up to 6.0. So maybe set params[4] to 6.0. Similarly, params[5] is 5.7; adding 1.0 would be 6.7, which is over. So set to 6.0. 

Alternatively, maybe adjust the bias terms. The current bias terms are 6 and 6. Maybe reducing them to 5.0 or 5.0. But I need to check which parameters to adjust. Since the user wants exploration, perhaps changing one parameter at a time. For example, take the highest reward params and change one parameter by +/-1.0. Let's pick params[2] from -6 to -5 (adding 1.0). That would be one direction. Or maybe params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3 (but capped at 6.0). 

Another approach is to check which parameters might be contributing to the lower reward. For instance, maybe the bias terms are too high. If we lower them, perhaps the policy becomes more balanced. But without knowing the exact impact, it's hard to tell. 

Alternatively, looking at the other examples, some lower rewards have lower values in params[8] and [9]. For example, in one case, they're 5 and 5. Maybe adjusting the bias terms from 6 to 5. But again, need to explore.

Since the user wants exploration, I should generate a new set of parameters by modifying one or more parameters by +/-1.0 from the current top. Let's take the highest reward example (params[0] to [9] as before) and adjust params[2] from -6 to -5 (adding 1.0), and params[4] from 5.3 to 6.0 (adding 0.7, but since step size is 1.0, maybe that's not allowed. Wait, the step size is 1.0, so each parameter can be changed by exactly +/-1.0. So for params[4], 5.3 +1.0 = 6.3, but that's over the limit. So the maximum allowed is 6.0, so we can only set it to 6.0. Similarly, params[5] can be increased from 5.7 to 6.7 (but capped at 6.0). So set to 6.0. 

So modifying params[2] from -6 to -5, and params[4] to 6.0, params[5] to 6.0. Let's try that. Also, maybe adjust the bias terms. For example, set params[8] and [9] to 5.0 instead of 6.0. 

But the user said to explore, so maybe just change one parameter. Let's pick params[2] from -6 to -5. So the new params would be:

params[0]:6, params[1]:1.3, params[2]:-5, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:5.7, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:6, params[9]:6. Wait, but that's already in the examples (the second example with reward 486.85). Oh, but the user said not to propose previously seen params. So that's a problem. 

So need to find a new combination. Let's think. Maybe change params[3] from 6 to 5 (subtracting 1.0). So params[3] becomes 5.0. Then, the new params would be:

params[0]:6, params[1]:1.3, params[2]:-6, params[3]:5, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:5.7, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:6, params[9]:6. 

Is this a new set? Looking at the previous examples, I don't see this exact combination. So that's a possible candidate. 

Alternatively, change params[6] from -6 to -5. So params[6]:-5. Then, the new params would be:

params[0]:6, params[1]:1.3, params[2]:-6, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:5.7, params[6]:-5, params[7]:6, params[8]:6, params[9]:6. 

But again, need to check if this is already in the examples. The first example had params[6] as -6, so changing it to -5 would be new. 

Alternatively, change params[8] and [9] from 6 to 5. Let's try that. So:

params[0]:6, params[1]:1.3, params[2]:-6, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:5.7, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:5, params[9]:5. 

This was in the second example (params[8] and [9] as 5 and 5, but others were different). Wait, the second example had params[2] as -5, [3] as 6, [4] as 5.3, [5] as 5.7, [6] as -5, [7] as 6. So that's different. So this new set would be different. 

But the user wants exploration, so trying to change multiple parameters. However, to avoid previous examples, perhaps changing two parameters. For example, change params[2] from -6 to -5 and params[3] from 6 to 5. 

So the new params would be:

params[0]:6, params[1]:1.3, params[2]:-5, params[3]:5, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:5.7, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:6, params[9]:6. 

This seems new. Let me check previous examples. The first example had params[2] as -6 and [3] as 6. So changing both to -5 and 5 would be new. 

Alternatively, maybe change params[4] and [5]. Since in the highest reward example, params[4] is 5.3 and [5] is 5.7. Adding 1.0 to each would make them 6.3 and 6.7, but capped at 6.0. So setting them to 6.0. 

So new params would be:

params[0]:6, params[1]:1.3, params[2]:-6, params[3]:6, params[4]:6, params[5]:6, params[6]:-6, params[7 Ngày 6, params[8]:6, params[9]:6. 

But this was in the example with reward 491.70? No, the first example had params[4] as 5.3 and [5] as 5.7. So changing them to 6.0 would be a new set. 

But need to check if that's already in the examples. The fifth example in the list has params[4] as 6 and [5] as 6. Wait, the fifth example is not listed here. The user provided some examples, but I need to check the ones given. 

In the given examples, the highest reward is 491.70 with params[4] as 5.3 and [5] as 5.7. So changing those to 6.0 would be a new set. 

So that's a possibility. Let's try that. 

So, the new parameters would be:

params[0]:6, params[1]:1.3, params[2]:-6, params[3]:6, params[4]:6, params[5]:6, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:6, params[9]:6. 

This is a new set. 

Alternatively, change params[8] and [9] from 6 to 5. So:

params[0]:6, params[1]:1.3, params[2]:-6, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:5.7, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:5, params[9]:5. 

This is also new. 

But the user wants to explore, so trying different variations. Maybe changing one parameter. For example, changing params[2] from -6 to -5. So:

params[0]:6, params[1]:1.3, params[2]:-5, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:5.7, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:6, params[9]:6. 

This was in the second example (reward 486.85), so can't use that. 

Another option: change params[3] from 6 to 5. So:

params[0]:6, params[1]:1.3, params[2]:-6, params[3]:5, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:5.7, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:6, params[9]:6. 

This is new. 

Alternatively, change params[6] from -6 to -5. So:

params[0]:6, params[1]:1.3, params[2]:-6, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:5.7, params[6]:-5, params[7]:6, params[8]:6, params[9]:6. 

This is new. 

So, which one to choose? Since the user wants exploration, maybe try multiple. But the answer requires one set. So perhaps pick one of these. For example, changing params[3] from 6 to 5. 

Thus, the final answer would be:

params[0]:6, params[1]:1.3, params[2]:-6, params[3]:5, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:5.7, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:6, params[9]:6.
</think>

params[0]:6, params[1]:1.3, params[2]:-6, params[3]:5, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:5.7, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:6, params[9]:6
