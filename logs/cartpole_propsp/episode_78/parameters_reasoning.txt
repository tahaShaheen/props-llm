SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

Now you are at iteration 78 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has provided a bunch of training examples where the params are varied, and the reward is around 500 in most cases, except for a few where it's lower. The current iteration is 78 out of 400, and the goal is to find the global optimum which should be around 500. The user mentioned that if we're below that, we should explore instead of exploiting.

Looking at the examples, many of them have the same params except for a few values. For instance, params[8] and params[9] are sometimes 3.3 and 4.2, but in one case, params[9] was 5.2 and the reward dropped to 389. Then, when params[4] was changed from -2.4 to -1.4, the reward increased to 422.15. Also, when params[0] was changed to 4.2, the reward was 485, which is close to 500 but not quite there.

The user's note says that during exploration, we should use a search step size of 1.0. So maybe we need to perturb some of the parameters that have been in the examples. Let's look at the parameters that have been tried. For example, params[0] has been 3.2, 4.2, 2.2, etc. Similarly, params[1] has been 4.3 and 5.3. Maybe trying to increase some parameters by 1.0 or decrease them.

Looking at the current best examples, the ones with 500 reward have params[0] as 3.2, params[1] as 4.3, params[2] as 1.3, params[3] as 4.6, params[4] as -2.4, params[5] as 1.9, params[6] as -4.9, params[7] as -0.1, params[8] as 3.3, params[9] as 4.2. But in some cases, changing params[8] to 4.3 or params[9] to 5.2 affected the reward.

Wait, but the user's instruction says that the global optimum should be around 500. So maybe the current examples are already at 500, but we need to check if there are other parameters that can get even higher. However, the user's note says that if we are below 500, we should explore. But in the given examples, many are at 500. However, the user's instruction says that the global optimum should be around 500, so maybe we are already at the maximum, but the user wants to ensure that we are not stuck in a local optimum.

Wait, but the user's initial message says that the global optimum should be around 500. So maybe the examples provided are already at the maximum. However, the user is asking for the next iteration, so perhaps we need to explore further. But the examples given have some parameters that could be adjusted. For example, in the example where params[8] was 3.3 and params[9] was 4.2, changing params[8] to 4.3 or 2.3 didn't change the reward. But when params[9] was changed to 5.2, the reward dropped. So maybe adjusting other parameters.

Alternatively, looking at params[4], which was -2.4 in some cases and -1.4 in another. The one with -1.4 had a reward of 422, which is lower than 500. So maybe that's not the direction. What about params[6]? It was -4.9 in most cases. Could changing that to a different value help? For example, trying -5.9 or -3.9, but those were already tried and didn't improve the reward.

Alternatively, looking at params[2] and params[3]. In some examples, params[2] was 1.3, 2.3, 0.3. The ones with 1.3 had 500, while others also had 500. So maybe that's not the key.

Wait, the user's instruction says that during exploration, use a search step size of 1.0. So perhaps we need to take a step in some parameter that hasn't been tried yet. Let's look for parameters that have not been varied much. For example, params[7] was -0.1 in most cases. What if we change that to 1.1 or -1.1? Or params[5] is 1.9. Maybe increasing that by 1.0 to 2.9? But in one example, params[5] was 2.9 and the reward was 500. So that didn't change.

Alternatively, looking at params[8] and params[9], which are the bias terms. In some cases, changing params[8] to 4.3 or 2.3 didn't affect the reward. But when params[9] was 5.2, the reward dropped. So maybe trying to adjust params[8] or params[9] by 1.0 in some direction.

But the user's note says that we should not propose previously seen params. So we need to check which parameters have been used. For example, in the examples, params[8] was 3.3, 4.3, 2.3. So maybe trying 4.3 (already tried) or 5.3? But in one example, params[1] was 5.3 and the reward was 238.3, which is worse. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, looking at other parameters. For example, params[0] was 3.2, 4.2, 2.2. What if we try 4.2 (already tried) or 5.2? Or 1.2? But 1.2 hasn't been tried. However, the user's instruction says to use a search step size of 1.0 during exploration. So if the current value is 3.2, adding 1.0 would be 4.2 (already tried), subtracting 1.0 would be 2.2 (also tried). So maybe that's not helpful.

Hmm, perhaps looking at params[7], which was -0.1. Adding 1.0 would make it 0.9, which was tried in one example and the reward was 500. Subtracting 1.0 would make it -1.1, which was also tried and the reward was 500. So no improvement.

What about params[6], which was -4.9. Adding 1.0 would be -3.9 (tried, 500), subtracting 1.0 would be -5.9 (tried, 500). So no change.

Looking at params[5], which was 1.9. Adding 1.0 gives 2.9 (tried, 500). Subtracting 1.0 gives 0.9, which hasn't been tried yet. Maybe trying that.

Alternatively, looking at params[4], which was -2.4. Adding 1.0 would be -1.4 (tried, 422.15), which is lower. Subtracting 1.0 would be -3.4 (tried, 500). So maybe that's not helpful.

What about params[3], which was 4.6. Adding 1.0 gives 5.6 (tried in one example, but the reward was 500). Subtracting 1.0 gives 3.6 (tried, 500). So no change.

Hmm, maybe looking at params[2], which was 1.3. Adding 1.0 gives 2.3 (tried, 500). Subtracting 1.0 gives 0.3 (tried, 500). So no improvement.

What about params[1], which was 4.3. Adding 1.0 gives 5.3 (tried, 238.3, worse). Subtracting 1.0 gives 3.3 (not tried yet). Maybe trying that.

So, if we take params[1] from 4.3 to 3.3, keeping other parameters the same. Let's see:

params[0]: 3.2; params[1]: 3.3; params[2]: 1.3; params[3]: 4.6; params[4]: -2.4; params[5]: 1.9; params[6]: -4.9; params[7]: -0.1; params[8]: 3.3; params[9]: 4.2.

This hasn't been tried before. So that's a new parameter set. Let's propose that.

params[0]: 3.2, params[1]: 3.3, params[2]: 1.3, params[3]: 4.6, params[4]: -2.4, params[5]: 1.9, params[6]: -4.9, params[7]: -0.1, params[8]: 3.3, params[9]: 4.2
