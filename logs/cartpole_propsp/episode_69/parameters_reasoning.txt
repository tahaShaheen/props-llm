SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

Now you are at iteration 69 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to optimize the parameters for a linear policy in the CartPole environment. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward, which they mentioned should be around 500. From the examples given, several parameter sets have already achieved 500.00, which is the maximum possible reward. However, the user is at iteration 69 out of 400 and needs to proceed.

First, I need to check if there are any parameters that haven't been tried yet. Looking at the examples, many of the parameters are similar, with slight variations. For instance, params[8] and params[9] have been adjusted in some cases, but others remain the same. The user's note says not to propose previously seen params, so I need to find a new combination.

Looking at the current examples, the params that have achieved 500.00 have params[8] as 3.3 or 4.3, and params[9] as 4.2 or 3.2. Maybe adjusting these could lead to a better reward. But since the maximum is already 500, perhaps the user is looking for a different approach. However, the note says that if the reward is below 500, they should explore. But in this case, the examples have already reached 500.00, so maybe the user wants to confirm that there's no higher value.

Wait, the note says the global optimum should be around 500. If the current examples have already reached that, maybe the user is looking for confirmation that no higher value exists. However, the user's instruction says to explore if below 500. Since the current examples have 500, perhaps the next step is to check if any parameters can be adjusted to see if a higher value is possible. But the problem is that the maximum possible reward in CartPole is indeed 500, as the environment ends when the pole falls, and each step gives +1. So 500 is the maximum possible.

But the user might be trying to find the exact parameters that achieve this. Since the examples have already achieved 500, maybe the user wants to see if there are other parameter sets that also achieve 500. However, the instruction says not to propose previously seen params. Therefore, I need to find a new set of parameters that haven't been tried yet but could also achieve 500.

Looking at the existing examples, most of the parameters are similar. For example, params[0] is 3.2, params[1] is 4.3, params[2] is 1.3, params[3] is 4.6, params[4] is -2.4, params[5] is 1.9, params[6] is -4.9, params[7] is -0.1, params[8] is 3.3 or 4.3, and params[9] is 4.2 or 3.2. So maybe varying other parameters that haven't been changed yet. For example, params[6] is -4.9 in most cases, but in one example, it's -5.9 or -6.0, but those also achieved 500.00. However, those have been tried already.

Wait, the user's note says to explore with a step size of 1.0 during exploration. Since the current examples have already reached 500, maybe the user is in a local optimum and needs to explore further. However, the examples provided have already achieved the maximum, so perhaps the user is just confirming that there are multiple parameter sets that reach the same reward. But the instruction says not to propose previously seen params, so I need to find a new set.

Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the examples, and the actual maximum is higher. But in the standard CartPole environment, the maximum reward is 500. So the examples are correct. Therefore, the current parameters are already optimal. However, the user might want to see if other parameters can also reach the same reward. But since the user says not to propose previously seen params, I need to find a new combination.

Looking at the parameters, maybe adjusting params[8] and params[9] further. For example, in one example, params[8] is 3.3 and params[9] is 4.2. If I change params[8] to 2.3 or 4.3 and params[9] to 5.2, but those have been tried. Alternatively, changing other parameters. For example, params[2] is 1.3 in most cases. What if I change it to 0.3 or 2.3? But those have been tried as well.

Wait, looking at the examples, the user has tried varying params[8] and params[9] between 3.3, 4.3, 5.2, 3.2, 4.2, etc. Maybe trying other values for params[8] and params[9] that haven't been used yet. For example, params[8] could be 2.3 or 5.3, but those might be out of the range. Wait, the parameters are in the range [-6.0, 6.0] with one decimal place. So possible values are from -6.0 to 6.0 in steps of 0.1.

In the existing examples, params[8] has been 3.3, 4.3, 2.3, 3.3 again, etc. So maybe trying 5.3 for params[8] or 1.3 for params[9]. However, the user's instruction is to not repeat previous params. So I need to find a new combination that hasn't been tried yet.

Alternatively, maybe changing other parameters. For example, params[7] is -0.1 in most examples. What if I change that to 0.9 or -1.1? Those have been tried. Or params[6] is -4.9, but in some examples, it's -5.9 or -6.0, which have been tried.

Wait, the user's note says that during exploration, use a search step size of 1.0. So if the current parameters are in a region that's already achieving 500, maybe perturbing them by 1.0 in some parameters. For example, if params[0] is 3.2, adding 1.0 would make it 4.2, but that's a new value. Similarly, subtracting 1.0 would make it 2.2, which has been tried in one example (params[0]: 2.2; f(params): 219.85). So that's worse. But trying 4.2 for params[0] hasn't been done yet.

Alternatively, trying to change params[1] from 4.3 to 5.3 or 3.3. But 3.3 has been tried in one example (params[1]: 3.3; f(params): 484.05). So that's lower than 500. So maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, changing params[4] from -2.4 to -1.4 or -3.4. Those have been tried, but they resulted in lower rewards. So maybe not helpful.

Hmm, this is tricky. All the parameters that have been tried so far that achieve 500.00 have similar structures. The user's instruction says not to propose previously seen params, so I need to find a new combination. However, given that the maximum is already achieved, maybe any new combination that hasn't been tried could be a candidate. But since the user is at iteration 69, they might need to continue exploring to confirm that the maximum is indeed 500.

Alternatively, maybe the user is looking for a different approach. For example, changing some parameters that haven't been varied much. For instance, in the examples, params[2] is 1.3, but in one example, it was 2.3 and 0.3. What if we try changing it to 1.3 ± 1.0, which would be 2.3 or 0.3, but those have been tried. So that's not new.

Looking at params[7], which is -0.1 in most examples. Changing it to 1.0 or -1.0 (but those have been tried as -1.1 and 0.9). So maybe 1.0 or -2.0. But that's a new value.

Alternatively, changing params[6] from -4.9 to -3.9 or -5.9, which have been tried. So maybe -6.9? Wait, no, the range is up to -6.0. So -6.0 is the minimum.

Alternatively, changing params[5] from 1.9 to 2.9 or 0.9. In one example, params[5] was 2.9, which achieved 500.00. So that's already tried. What about 0.9? That hasn't been tried yet. So maybe adjusting params[5] to 0.9 and other parameters.

But this is getting complicated. The key point is that the user has already achieved the maximum reward of 500.00 in several examples, so any new parameters that achieve the same or higher would be acceptable. However, since the maximum is 500, there's no higher value. Therefore, the user might just need to continue exploring to confirm that there are no better parameters, but given the examples, it's already achieved.

In that case, perhaps the next step is to propose a new parameter set that hasn't been tried yet, even if it's a small variation. For example, changing params[8] from 3.3 to 4.3 (already tried), or changing params[9] from 4.2 to 5.2 (but that was tried in one example and resulted in 386.65). So that's worse. Alternatively, changing other parameters.

Wait, looking back at the examples, there's one where params[8] is 2.3 and params[9] is 3.2, which achieved 500.00. So maybe adjusting params[8] and params[9] to other values. For example, if params[8] is 3.3 and params[9] is 5.2, but that was tried and resulted in 386.65. Not helpful.

Alternatively, changing params[6] to -5.9 (which was tried and achieved 500.00). So that's already done. Maybe changing other parameters like params[0] to 4.2 (not tried yet). Let's try that.

So, for example, changing params[0] from 3.2 to 4.2, keeping others the same. That would be a new parameter set. Let's see:

params[0]: 4.2; params[1]: 4.3; params[2]: 1.3; params[3]: 4.6; params[4]: -2.4; params[5]: 1.9; params[6]: -4.9; params[7]: -0.1; params[8]: 3.3; params[9]: 4.2.

This hasn't been tried in the examples provided, so it's a new set. The user might want to test this to see if it also achieves 500.00. However, this is just one possibility. Alternatively, changing other parameters. But given the time constraints, this seems like a reasonable next step.
