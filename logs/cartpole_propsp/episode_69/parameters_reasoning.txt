SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has given me a bunch of training examples for the CartPole environment with different parameter values and their corresponding episodic rewards. My task is to find the global optimal policy, which they mentioned should be around 500. The current examples have rewards up to 428, so there's room for improvement.

First, I need to analyze the existing parameters. Looking at the top examples, the ones with higher rewards have params like params[0], [1], [3], [4], [6], [7], [8], [9] set to higher values (6, 5.3, 6, etc.), while some like params[2] and [6] are negative. The B terms (params[8] and [9]) are often 6. 

But the user mentioned that if I'm below 500, I should explore instead of exploit. The current best is 428, so exploration is needed. The exploration step size is 1.0, so I should adjust parameters by +/-1.0 from existing values.

Looking at the current top parameters, maybe I can tweak some of the lower ones. For example, in the first example, params[2] is -3. Maybe increasing that to -2 or -4? But since the exploration step is 1.0, I can try changing params that are currently at extremes. Also, some parameters like params[5] are 2.7, which is lower than others. Maybe increasing that.

Wait, the user said to search both positive and negative values. So maybe there are some parameters that are not being explored enough. For instance, in the examples, params[2] is mostly around -3 to -4. What if I try a more negative value, like -5? Or maybe a positive one? But the policy is linear, so the effect of each parameter depends on the state.

Another approach is to look for parameters that might be underexplored. For example, in the examples, params[5] is often around 2.7 or 3.7. Maybe trying higher values, like 4.7? But the max is 6.0. Also, params[4] is 5.3 in many cases. Maybe increasing that to 6.3? Wait, but the range is up to 6.0. So 6.0 is the max.

Looking at the current best parameters: params[0] is 6, params[1] 1.3, params[2] -3, params[3] 6, params[4] 5.3, params[5] 2.7, params[6] -6, params[7] 6, params[8] 6, params[9] 6. The reward is 428.05. To explore, maybe adjust some of these. For example, changing params[2] from -3 to -2 (as in one of the examples, but that had lower reward). Alternatively, maybe try increasing params[5] to 3.7 or even 4.7. Also, check if params[7] could be higher, but it's already at 6.0.

Wait, the exploration step is 1.0, so I can add or subtract 1.0 from any parameter. Let's pick a parameter that's currently at a lower value and increase it. For example, params[2] is -3. If I add 1.0, it becomes -2. But that was tried in some examples with lower rewards. Alternatively, subtract 1.0 to make it -4. Maybe that's unexplored? Let me check the existing examples. There's one where params[2] is -4 (params[0]: 6; params[1]: 0.3; params[2]: -4; ... f(params): 398.45). So that's already tried but with lower reward. Maybe that's not the way.

Alternatively, look at params[5]. The current best is 2.7. Adding 1.0 would make it 3.7. One example had that with lower reward. But maybe combining with other changes. For instance, if I increase params[5] to 3.7 and also adjust another parameter.

Alternatively, check parameters that are not at the extremes. For example, params[1] is 1.3. Maybe increasing it to 2.3 or decreasing to 0.3. The example with params[1] 2.3 had lower reward. But maybe adjusting other parameters could help.

Another thought: the bias terms (params[8] and [9]) are all 6.0 in the best examples. What if I lower them? For example, set params[8] to 5.0 and see? But that might reduce the reward. Alternatively, keeping them at 6.0.

Wait, the user said to explore, so maybe try changing a parameter that's not been changed much. For instance, params[6] is -6 in the best examples. What if I try -5? But that was tried in some examples with lower rewards. Hmm.

Alternatively, check if any parameters are not being explored. For example, params[7] is 6 in most examples. What if I set it to 5? But that might not help. Alternatively, set some parameters to 0?

This is tricky. Since the exploration step is 1.0, maybe I should take one of the existing parameters and adjust it by +/-1.0. Let's pick a parameter that's in the middle. For example, params[4] is 5.3. Adding 1.0 would make it 6.3, but that's beyond the max of 6.0. So set to 6.0. Maybe that's better. Let's try that. So, in the current best parameters, params[4] is 5.3. Changing it to 6.0. Also, maybe adjust params[2] from -3 to -4? But that was tried before with lower reward. Alternatively, change params[2] to -2. But that was tried as well.

Alternatively, look for parameters that are not in the top examples. For example, in the examples, params[0] is always 5 or 6. Maybe trying 4? But that's a big step. Wait, the exploration step is 1.0, so from 6, subtract 1.0 to get 5. But that was tried in some examples with lower rewards.

Wait, maybe the key is to change multiple parameters at once. For example, in the current best, params[5] is 2.7. If I increase that to 3.7, and also adjust params[2] from -3 to -2. But that might be a combination that hasn't been tried yet. However, the user said not to propose previously seen params. So need to ensure that the new combination hasn't been tried before.

Looking at the examples, the first example has params[5] 2.7 and params[2] -3. The second example has params[5] 3.7 and params[2] -3. So changing params[5] to 3.7 and params[2] to -2 would be a new combination. Maybe that's worth trying.

So, let's try modifying params[5] from 2.7 to 3.7 and params[2] from -3 to -2. Also, maybe adjust another parameter. But I need to ensure that the new set of parameters hasn't been used before. Since the user provided 15 top and 5 recent, I should check if this combination is among them. The second example has params[2] -3 and params[5] 3.7, but the other parameters may differ. So maybe this is a new combination.

Alternatively, change params[4] from 5.3 to 6.0 and params[5] from 2.7 to 3.7. Let's try that. So:

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 1.3, params[2]: -3, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 6.0, params[5]: 3.7, params[6]: -6, params[7]: 6, params[8]: 6, params[9]: 6. 

But I need to check if this is a new set. Looking at the examples, the first example had params[4] 5.3 and params[5] 2.7. The second example had params[5] 3.7 but params[4] 5.3. So this combination hasn't been tried yet. So this could be a candidate for exploration.

Alternatively, change params[2] to -4 and params[5] to 3.7. Let's see. But I need to make sure that the step is 1.0. Since params[2] is currently -3, changing to -4 is a step of -1.0. That was tried in one example (params[0]: 6; params[1]: 0.3; params[2]: -4; ...), but with lower reward. However, maybe combining with other changes could help.

Alternatively, maybe the best approach is売れ to take the current best parameters and change one parameter by +/-1.0. For example, take the first example and change params[5] from 2.7 to 3.7. That would be a new parameter set. Let's do that.

So, the current best parameters are:

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 1.3, params[2]: -3, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 5.3, params[5]: 2.7, params[6]: -6, params[7]: 6, params[8]: 6, params[9]: 6.

Changing params[5] to 3.7 gives:

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 1.3, params[2]: -3, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 5.3, params[5]: 3.7, params[6]: -6, params[7]: 6, params[8]: 6, params[9]: 6.

This hasn't been tried before in the examples provided, so it's a valid exploration step. This might increase the reward by improving the contribution of params[5]. Alternatively, maybe other parameters need adjustment.

Another option is to adjust params[2] from -3 to -2, which was tried in one example but with lower reward. However, maybe combining with other changes could help. For instance, changing params[2] to -2 and params[5] to 3.7. Let's try that.

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 1.3, params[2]: -2, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 5.3, params[5]: 3.7, params[6]: -6, params[7]: 6, params[8]: 6, params[9]: 6.

This combination hasn't been seen before. It's a valid exploration step. This might lead to higher rewards.

Alternatively, adjust params[4] from 5.3 to 6.0. Since 5.3 + 1.0 = 6.3, which is over the limit, so set to 6.0. Let's try that:

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 1.3, params[2]: -3, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 6.0, params[5]: 2.7, params[6]: -6, params[7]: 6, params[8]: 6, params[9]: 6.

This is a new set of parameters. Maybe this increases the contribution of params[4], which is part of the weight for the state features.

I think the best approach here is to pick one parameter to adjust and see. Since the user said to explore, and the current best is at 428, I need to make a change that hasn't been tried yet. Let's go with changing params[5] from 2.7 to 3.7, keeping other parameters the same. That's a straightforward exploration step.
