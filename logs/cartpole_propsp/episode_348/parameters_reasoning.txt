SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 348 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to help someone find the global optimal policy for a cartpole environment using an RL algorithm. The user has provided some parameters and wants me to explore both positive and negative values around 500 episodes.

First, I need to understand how the reward function works. It gives +1 every time step where the pole is upright and the cart is within bounds. So, the goal is to maximize this reward. The current best in the examples is around 500, which seems promising but not perfect.

I remember that policy gradients are often used here because they can handle complex actions like pushing left or right. The policy here is linear with 18 parameters, meaning it's a neural network layer with one hidden layer, each node using a sigmoid activation function. This setup could potentially learn the optimal action based on state transitions.

Looking at the user's interaction steps, after providing several params, they get different rewards. The best so far are around 500, but there's room for improvement. The exploration step suggests trying both positive and negative values with a step size of 1.0, which means each parameter can vary from -6 to 6 in increments of 1.

I should propose new params that might explore the action space more thoroughly. Maybe try parameters that push the cart further or less, not just extremes. Let me think about possible combinations.

Maybe starting with higher left and right actions while keeping some balance in other parameters could be beneficial. For example, pushing even harder on both sides but not as hard as -6 or 6. Alternatively, perhaps adjusting pole angle to a bit more upright for longer periods when needed.

I also need to consider the reward function: every time step that fulfills the goal gives +1. So, getting consistent rewards across multiple steps is key. If some episodes give high rewards quickly and others have mixed results, it might require a better balance in exploration versus exploitation.

Perhaps trying parameters where the cart moves more frequently but doesn't overshoot the bounds too much, balancing pole up-keeping time with cart movement speed.

I should generate new params with varied left and right actions, maybe some middle values in other parameters as well. This way, I can see if higher rewards are possible beyond 500 or if there's a sweet spot that consistently yields good rewards across multiple episodes.
