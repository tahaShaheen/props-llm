SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 324 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is working on optimizing a linear policy for the CartPole environment. They've provided a bunch of previous parameter sets and their corresponding rewards. The goal is to find the global optimum, which they mention should be around 500. The current iteration is 324 out of 400, so there's still some time left.

Looking at the examples, most of the high-reward params have params[0] at 6, params[1] around 2.3, params[2] around -5, params[3] at 6, params[4] and [5] around 5.3-6, params[6] at -6, params[7] at 6, and params[8] and [9] around 5. However, some variations in these parameters lead to lower rewards. For instance, when params[2] is -4 or -6, the reward drops. Similarly, changing params[4] to 4.3 or 6 also reduces the reward.

The user mentioned that during exploration, a step size of 1.0 should be used. Since we're near the end of the iterations (324 out of 400), maybe it's time to explore slightly different parameters. But looking at the current top performers, they're already at the upper bounds for some parameters (like 6 and -6). Maybe tweaking some of the parameters that are slightly off, like params[8] or [9], which are at 5 in most cases. Could increasing or decreasing them by 1.0 help?

Wait, but the user said not to propose previously seen params. So I need to find new combinations. Let me check the existing params. The top ones have params[8] and [9] at 5. Maybe trying 6 or 4? Also, looking at params[4] and [5], they're mostly 5.3-6. Maybe adjusting those slightly. But since the step size is 1.0, perhaps trying to change params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3? But the range is up to 6.0. So maybe 6.0 is already the max. What about params[2], which is -5. Maybe trying -6 or -4? But previous attempts with -6 gave lower rewards. However, maybe combining that with other changes?

Alternatively, looking at the params that gave lower rewards, like when params[8] was 4, which led to a lower reward. So keeping params[8] and [9] at 5 seems better. What about params[7]? It's at 6 in most cases. What if we try 5? But that might decrease the reward. Hmm.

Another angle: the policy is a linear function. The action is determined by the maximum of the two outputs (state @ W + B). So, the weights and biases need to be set such that the correct action is chosen. Maybe adjusting the bias terms (params[8] and [9]) could help in cases where the state is near the boundary. However, since the previous bests have those at 5, maybe trying to increase them to 6? But that's already the upper bound.

Wait, the user said the global optimum should be around 500. The examples provided have several with 500.00. Maybe the current best is already at that, but the user wants to ensure that there's no better combination. Since we have 76 iterations left, perhaps exploring nearby parameters with step size 1.0. For example, changing params[1] from 2.3 to 3.3 (as in one of the examples, but that gave lower reward). Alternatively, trying to adjust params[2] from -5 to -5.0 (but that's already in the examples). Wait, the user said not to repeat previous params. So need to find new ones.

Another thought: maybe changing multiple parameters at once. For instance, increasing params[4] to 6.0 (already done in some examples), but also adjusting params[8] or [9]. But how to choose which ones? Since the step size is 1.0, perhaps trying to increase params[8] to 6.0, but keeping others the same. Let's try that.

So, a possible new parameter set could be: params[0] 6, params[1] 2.3, params[2] -5, params[3] 6, params[4] 5.3, params[5] 6, params[6] -6, params[7] 6, params[8] 6, params[9] 5. This changes params[8] from 5 to 6. Alternatively, changing params[9] to 6. Let's go with that. But need to make sure it's not in the previous examples. Looking back, the examples with params[8] at 5 and [9] at 5. So changing [8] to 6 would be a new set. Let me check if that's allowed. Yes, as long as it's not in the previous ones. The user said not to repeat previously seen params, so this would be new.

Alternatively, maybe changing params[2] from -5 to -5.0 (but that's the same as before). No, need to change something else. How about adjusting params[7] from 6 to 5? But that might lower the reward. Alternatively, adjust params[6] from -6 to -5. But previous examples with params[6] at -5 had lower rewards. Hmm.

Alternatively, adjust params[1] from 2.3 to 1.3 or 3.3. But the example with 3.3 had lower reward. However, maybe with other changes. For example, if params[1] is 3.3 but other parameters are adjusted. But this is getting complicated.

Another approach: since the current best is 500, and the user wants to ensure that there's no higher value, perhaps trying to explore in the vicinity of the current best by adjusting one parameter by 1.0. For example, changing params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3 (but it's capped at 6.0). So 6.0. But that's already in some examples. Maybe changing params[5] from 6 to 5? That might lower the reward. Alternatively, changing params[8] or [9] to 6.0. Let's try that.
