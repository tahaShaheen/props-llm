SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to improve my policy optimization in the cartpole environment. The goal is to get as close to a global optimal reward of around 500 as possible. Let me break down what I know and where I'm stuck.

First, the environment: it's a simple physics simulation with a cart that can't move frictionlessly, and a pole that needs to stay upright on the cart. The state includes the cart position, velocity, pole angle, and angular velocity. My policy is linear, using 18 parameters (2 actions * 9 parameters per action). Each step in the episode gives me a reward of +1 if the pole is upright and the cart is within bounds.

Looking at the parameters I'm trying: [0] = -4.5, [1]=-2.4, [2]=1.3, [3]=-1, [4]=-4.5, [5]=1.5, [6]=-3.5, [7]=4.5, [8]=-2.5, [9]=-2.5. The reward for this setup is 254.95 at iteration 167.

I remember the user mentioned that to reach around 500, I need to go beyond a local optimum and explore more. So my current parameters are below that optimal value. I need to adjust them accordingly.

Let me think about how changing these parameters affects the policy. The parameters define the weights of each state component in determining the action. So increasing certain parameters would mean the corresponding states have a stronger influence on selecting the action (push left or push right).

For example, looking at [2] which is 1.3 and [5] which is 1.5. If I increase these values, it might make the pole angle more significant in determining whether to act left or right. Similarly, increasing parameters like [7], [8], and [9] could affect the angular velocity's influence.

Wait, but if I push too much into certain directions (like pushing right when a left action is better), that could cause instability. I need to balance where I'm pushing to avoid the pole falling over or the cart going out of bounds.

Let me consider some possible parameter adjustments:

1. Increase [2] and [5] more than the current values: Maybe set them higher, like 1.8 each.
   - This would mean the pole angle's effect is stronger on action selection.
   
2. Lower [7], [8], and [9]: Let's say -2.0 instead of -2.5 to make angular velocity have less influence.
   - But if these are too low, it might not help in balancing angles.

3. Adjust [6] from -3.5 to 1.5: Maybe a more positive value for pole angle.
   - If the pole is upright when I'm acting right, that could be good.

4. Also, maybe adjust [8], which affects angular velocity's influence on the action. Let me set it lower, like -2.0 instead of -2.5.

Putting these together: [0]=-4.5, [1]=-2.4, [2]=1.8, [3]=-1, [4]=-4.5, [5]=1.5, [6]=1.5, [7]=4.0, [8]=-2.0, [9]=-2.0.

I think this would make the pole angle more critical in action selection and reduce the influence of angular velocity on pushing decisions. This might help balance the pole upright while allowing for better cart control without making the system unstable.

Let me test this hypothesis by running it through the policy function and seeing if the reward improves. If not, I can adjust other parameters. It's a bit trial-and-error, but systematic changes should help converge towards higher rewards.
