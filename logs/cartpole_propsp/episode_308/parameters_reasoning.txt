SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 308 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of training examples with their corresponding episodic rewards. The goal is to find the optimal parameters for the linear policy in the CartPole environment. The current iteration is 308 out of 400, so we're in the later stages. The global optimum is supposed to be around 500, and the examples given have some reaching 500.00.

Looking at the examples, the top ones have params like params[0] to params[9] with values such as 6, 2.3, -5, 6, 5.3, 6, -6, 6, 5, 5. These seem to be in the higher range, but some variations are tried, like changing params[2] from -5 to -4 or -6, which led to lower rewards. Also, when params[7] was changed from 6 to 5, the reward dropped significantly. 

The user mentioned that during exploration, a step size of 1.0 should be used. Since we're near the maximum iterations, maybe we need to explore around the current best parameters. The current best is 500.00 with params like 6, 2.3, -5, 6, 5.3, 6, -6, 6, 5, 5. 

Looking for possible parameters to tweak. Maybe adjusting some of the lower values. For example, params[1] is 2.3. What if we increase it by 1.0 to 3.3? But in one of the examples, that led to a lower reward (391.35). Alternatively, maybe decreasing it? But 2.3 is already low. 

Another parameter is params[4], which is 5.3. If we increase it to 6.3, but the range is up to 6.0. So can't. Maybe decrease to 4.3? But in an example, that led to lower reward. 

Looking at params[6], which is -6. Maybe changing it to -5? But in one example, that led to a lower reward. However, maybe trying other parameters. What about params[8] and params[9], both are 5. If we increase them to 6? Let's see. 

Alternatively, check if any parameters are not at the extremes. For example, params[2] is -5. Maybe trying -5.5? But the step size is 1.0, so maybe -6 or -4. But in the examples, -5 seems better. 

Wait, the user said during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So perhaps we need to make a change of 1.0 in one of the parameters. Let's look for parameters that are not at the extremes. For instance, params[1] is 2.3. If we add 1.0, that's 3.3, but that was tried and resulted in lower reward. If we subtract 1.0, that's 1.3. Maybe that's a possibility. 

Alternatively, check params[7], which is 6. If we lower it by 1.0 to 5.0, but in an example that led to a lower reward. However, maybe other parameters. 

Looking at params[4] is 5.3. If we increase it by 0.7 to 6.0, but the step size is 1.0. So maybe 6.0 is the max. But in the examples, when params[4] was 5.3, it was part of the top rewards. 

Another idea: check the parameters that are not at the extremes. For example, params[1] is 2.3, which is not at 6.0. Maybe increasing it by 1.0 to 3.3? But that was tried and gave lower reward. Alternatively, maybe decreasing it to 1.3? Let's try that. 

Alternatively, check params[8] and params[9] are 5.0. If we increase them to 6.0. Let's try changing params[8] to 6.0 and see. 

But how to decide which parameter to change? Since the user says to explore both positive and negative values. Let's pick a parameter that's not at the extremes. For example, params[1] is 2.3. Let's try changing it to 3.3 (adding 1.0) or 1.3 (subtracting 1.0). But in the examples, changing to 3.3 gave lower reward. So maybe trying 1.3. 

Alternatively, check params[2] is -5.0. If we add 1.0, that's -4.0. In one example, that gave a slightly lower reward (499.95). So maybe that's not helpful. 

Another parameter is params[4] is 5.3. If we subtract 1.0 to get 4.3, but that was tried and gave lower reward. 

Hmm. Maybe the current best is already near the optimal, but to explore, we need to make a step. Let's consider changing a parameter that's not at the extremes. For example, params[8] and params[9] are 5.0. Let's try increasing them to 6.0. 

So, let's take the current best parameters and change params[8] from 5.0 to 6.0. Let's see what that does. The rest remain the same. 

Alternatively, change params[9] to 6.0. 

Alternatively, check if any other parameters are not at the extremes. For example, params[7] is 6.0. If we lower it to 5.0, but that was tried and gave lower reward. 

Alternatively, check params[6] is -6.0. If we raise it to -5.0, but that was tried and gave lower reward. 

Hmm. Maybe the best approach is to make a small change to one of the parameters that's not at the extremes. For example, params[1] is 2.3. Let's try changing it to 3.3 (but that was tried and gave lower reward). Alternatively, change it to 1.3. 

But since the user says to explore with step size 1.0, perhaps we need to make a change of 1.0 in one of the parameters. Let's pick a parameter that's in the middle, like params[1], and adjust it. 

Alternatively, look for parameters that are not in the examples. For example, maybe params[3] is 6.0. If we lower it to 5.0? But in one example, that was tried with params[3] as 5, which gave 500.00. Wait, no, in the third example, params[3] was 5 and the reward was 500.00. So that's possible. 

Wait, looking back at the examples, the first example has params[3] as 6.0 and reward 500.00. The third example has params[3] as 5.0 and reward 500.00. So maybe changing params[3] between 5 and 6 doesn't affect much. 

Another thought: since the current best is 500.00, maybe we need to explore other parameters. Let's try changing params[2] from -5.0 to -6.0. But in one example, that led to lower reward. Alternatively, change it to -4.0, which also gave lower reward. 

Alternatively, check params[4] is 5.3. If we change it to 6.3 (but can't, since max is 6.0). So maybe 6.0. Let's try that. 

So, taking the current best parameters and changing params[4] from 5.3 to 6.0. Let's see. 

But how to ensure that we're not repeating previous params. The user said not to propose previously seen params. So, we need to generate a new set. 

Looking at the examples, the current best is params[0] to [9] as 6, 2.3, -5, 6, 5.3, 6, -6, 6, 5, 5. 

So, to explore, let's change one parameter by 1.0. For example, params[1] is 2.3. Let's try 3.3. But that was tried and gave lower reward. Alternatively, 1.3. 

Alternatively, change params[8] from 5.0 to 6.0. Let's try that. 

So the new params would be: params[0]:6, params[1]:2.3, params[2]:-5, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:6, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:6, params[9]:5. 

This is a new set of parameters not seen before. Let's check if that's valid. 

Alternatively, change params[9] to 6.0. 

But the user says to explore both positive and negative values. Maybe changing a parameter that's positive to negative or vice versa. 

Another option: change params[2] from -5 to -6 (but that was tried and gave lower reward). 

Alternatively, change params[7] from 6 to 5 (but that was tried and gave lower reward). 

Hmm. It seems that most parameters are already at the extremes. Maybe the only way to explore is to adjust the parameters that are not at extremes. 

Looking at params[1] is 2.3. Maybe changing it to 1.3. Let's try that. 

So, the new params would be: params[0]:6, params[1]:1.3, params[2]:-5, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:6, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:5, params[9]:5. 

This is a new set. 

Alternatively, change params[4] to 6.0 (since 5.3 + 0.7 would be 6.0, but step size is 1.0. So maybe 6.0. 

So, changing params[4] from 5.3 to 6.0. 

params[0]:6, params[1]:2.3, params[2]:-5, params[3]:6, params[4]:6.0, params[5]:6, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:5, params[9]:5. 

This is anotherừa

params[1]: 1.3  
params[2]: -5.0  
params[3]: 6.0  
params[4]: 5.3

params[6]: -6.0  
params[7]: 6.0  
params[8]: 5.0  
params[9]: 5.0
