SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.
--- TOP 3 BEST PERFORMING PARAMS ---
params[0]: 6; params[1]: 6; params[2]: -3; params[3]: 6; params[4]: -6; params[5]: 1.8; params[6]: -3.5; params[7]: 4.5; params[8]: -2.5; params[9]: -2.5; f(params): 500.00

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 6; params[2]: 4; params[3]: 6; params[4]: -6; params[5]: -5; params[6]: -3.5; params[7]: 4.5; params[8]: -2.5; params[9]: -2.5; f(params): 495.70
params[0]: 6; params[1]: 6; params[2]: 4; params[3]: 6; params[4]: -6; params[5]: 1.8; params[6]: -3.5; params[7]: 4.5; params[8]: -2.5; params[9]: -2.5; f(params): 500.00


Now you are at iteration 307 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to find the optimal parameters for this cartpole environment using a linear policy. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward by adjusting the 'params' array of 10 values. Each parameter can range from -6.0 to 6.0 with one decimal place.

I've been given some examples where certain 'params' lead to specific rewards. For instance, params[0] being 6 and others set to specific values give a reward of 500, which is pretty good. But when I look at the most recent example, changing the last two parameters didn't improve the score much; it went down slightly.

Hmm, maybe the optimal point isn't exactly at those extremes but somewhere in between. Since the global optimum is supposed to be around 500, I should aim for values that are as close to these examples as possible without going too far. 

Looking at the parameters provided, they're all pretty high except for params[6] and [7]. That might not be ideal because higher velocities in the pole or cart can cause issues. Maybe I need to balance them out a bit.

I think about how each parameter affects the state transitions. The first two parameters are for position and velocity of the cart. If both are too high, it might make the system unstable. Similarly, the third and fourth are for the pole's angle and its angular velocity. A higher angle could tip the pole over if not controlled.

I should also consider that increasing params[0] and [1] to 6 gives a good reward but may risk too much movement in other parts of the state. Maybe there's a sweet spot between -6 and 6 for these parameters. 

For params[2], setting it to 4 seems like a moderate value, which helps with balance without causing too high velocities. The fifth parameter at -5 might help in some way, but I'm not sure if that's the right direction.

The other parameters seem more manageable—params[3], [8], and [9] are around 6, 4, and -2.5 respectively. These likely contribute to stabilizing both the pole and the cart without causing too much disturbance.

Putting this together, I think adjusting params[0], [1], [2], [6], and [7] towards the extremes but within reasonable ranges could lead to a better reward. Maybe setting them to 6, -3.5, 4, -3.5, and 6 respectively would provide a good balance without exceeding the parameter limits.
