SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).

Now you are at iteration 25 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has provided a bunch of training examples with different params and their corresponding episodic rewards. The goal is to find the global optimal policy, which the user mentioned should be around 500. But looking at the examples, the highest reward so far is 224.50. Hmm, that's way below 500. So I need to explore more.

First, I need to understand the pattern in the examples. Looking at the params that gave higher rewards, like the one with 224.50: params[0] is -3.8, params[1] is 2.5, and so on. The W matrix for that example has some high values, like 5.6 and 6.0. Also, the bias terms (params[8] and [9]) are around 2.7 to 3.9. Maybe increasing some of these parameters further could lead to higher rewards.

But the user said that during exploration, the step size should be 1.0. So I need to adjust the parameters by adding or subtracting 1.0 from the current ones. However, I must ensure that the new parameters are within the range of [-6.0, 6.0]. Let me check the previous examples to see which ones might be candidates for adjustment.

Looking at the example with 224.50, params[0] is -3.8. If I increase that by 1.0, it becomes -2.8, which is still within the range. Similarly, params[2] is 5.6; adding 1.0 would make it 6.6, which is over 6.0, so that's not allowed. So maybe decrease it by 1.0 to 4.6. But the user wants exploration, so perhaps trying both directions. However, since the previous example had params[2] at 5.6 and that worked, maybe increasing other parameters could help.

Wait, the user mentioned that the global optimum should be around 500. But the current highest is 224.50. So there's a lot of room for improvement. Maybe the current examples are not in the right direction. Let me think about the policy structure.

The policy is a linear function: action = argmax(state @ W + B). So, the weights W and bias B determine the action based on the state. To keep the pole upright, the policy needs to adjust the cart's position and velocity, and the pole's angle and angular velocity. The reward is +1 per step, so the longer the episode, the higher the reward. So the goal is to keep the pole balanced as long as possible.

In the examples, some params have high values in W and B. For instance, in the 224.50 example, params[2] and [3] are 5.6, which might be contributing to a strong response to the pole's angle and angular velocity. Maybe increasing those even more would help, but they can't exceed 6.0. Let me check that example again: params[2] is 5.6, so adding 0.4 would make it 6.0. But the user said to use a step size of 1.0 during exploration, so maybe adjusting by 1.0. But since 5.6 + 1.0 is 6.6, which is over 6.0, that's not allowed. So perhaps decreasing it by 1.0 to 4.6? That might not be helpful. Alternatively, maybe adjusting other parameters.

Looking at params[4] and [5], which are part of the W matrix for cart velocity and pole angular velocity. In the 224.50 example, params[4] is -5.6 and params[5] is 3.6. Maybe adjusting those. For example, increasing params[4] by 1.0 to -4.6. But I need to ensure that the changes are in the right direction.

Alternatively, looking at other examples. The example with 168.85 had params[0] at -3.8, params[1] at 2.5, params[2] at 4.6, etc. But that's lower than the 224.50 example. So maybe the 224.50 example is a better candidate for exploration.

Since the user said to explore with step size 1.0, perhaps taking the previous best (params that gave 224.50) and adjusting each parameter by +/-1.0. Let me take that example:

params[0]: -3.8; params[1]: 2.5; params[2]: 5.6; params[3]: 5.6; params[4]: -5.6; params[5]: 3.6; params[6]: -5.3; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 2.7; params[9]: 2.9.

Now, for exploration, I can adjust each parameter by +/-1.0, ensuring they stay within [-6,6]. For example:

- params[0] can be adjusted to -4.8 (since -3.8 -1.0 = -4.8) or -2.8 (but -2.8 is allowed). However, the user might prefer exploring in the direction that could lead to higher rewards. But since we don't know, it's better to try both. However, the user said "during exploration, use search step size of 1.0". So perhaps generating new params by adding or subtracting 1.0 to each parameter in the current best.

But the user also said "do not propose previously seen params". So I need to make sure that the new params haven't been tried before. Looking at the examples, the previous ones had similar values but not exactly the same. For instance, the example with 224.50 has params[0] at -3.8. If I adjust that to -4.8, which hasn't been tried in the examples provided, that's a new param.

So, let's try adjusting params[0] from -3.8 to -4.8 (subtracting 1.0). Then, check if that's within the range. Yes, -4.8 is allowed. Then, other parameters can be adjusted similarly. However, the user might want a single set of params in the response. Since the user is at iteration 25, and the maximum is 400, there's a lot of time left for exploration.

Alternatively, maybe trying to increase the params that are already high. For example, params[7] is 6.0 (the maximum allowed). So that can't be increased further. But maybe decreasing it by 1.0 to 5.0. But that might not be helpful. Alternatively, adjusting other parameters.

Alternatively, looking at the params[4] in the 224.50 example is -5.6. Adding 1.0 would make it -4.6. Maybe that's a better value. But again, without knowing, it's a guess.

Alternatively, considering that the highest reward so far is 224.50, and the user wants to reach around 500, maybe there's a need to explore more aggressively. However, the user said that during exploration, the step size is 1.0. So perhaps generating a new set of params by taking the current best and adjusting each parameter by +/-1.0 in some way.

Alternatively, looking at the params that gave the highest reward (224.50) and adjusting the ones that are not at the extremes. For example, params[8] is 2.7. Adding 1.0 would make it 3.7, which is allowed. Similarly, params[9] is 2.9; adding 1.0 would be 3.9, which is allowed.

So, let's create a new set of params by taking the 224.50 example and increasing params[8] and [9] by 1.0 each, and also adjusting other parameters if possible. But need to ensure that the new params haven't been tried before.

Wait, in the examples, there's a params set where params[8] is 3.7 and params[9] is 3.9. For example, the example with 188.40 has params[8] = 3.7 and [9] = 3.9. But that's a different set. So maybe adjusting params[8] and [9] from 2.7 and 2.9 to 3.7 and 3.9. However, that's already tried in some examples. So that might not be allowed as per the user's instruction not to propose previously seen params.

Therefore, need to find a new set. Let's take the 224.50 example and adjust one parameter by 1.0. For example, increase params[1] from 2.5 to 3.5. That would be a new set. Let's check if that's allowed. Yes, 3.5 is within [-6,6]. So the new params would be:

params[0]: -3.8; params[1]: 3.5; params[2]: 5.6; params[3]: 5.6; params[4]: -5.6; params[5]: 3.6; params[6]: -5.3; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 2.7; params[9]: 2.9.

But in the examples, there's a similar set where params[1] is 3.5, like the one with 137.45. However, that example had different other parameters. So maybe this is a new set.

Alternatively, adjust params[2] from 5.6 to 6.6 (but that's over the limit). So not allowed. So adjust it to 4.6 instead. That would be a new set. But that might not be as effective.

Alternatively, adjust params[4] from -5.6 to -4.6. That could be a new set.

But the user wants the response in the exact format, so I need to pick one set. Considering that the previous example with 224.50 had params[0] at -3.8, maybe adjusting that to -4.8 (subtracting 1.0) and keeping others the same. Let's check if that's a new param. In the examples, there's a param with params[0] at -4.8 in some cases, like the 127.00 example. But that example had other parameters different. So maybe that's a new set.

So, the new params would be:

params[0]: -4.8; params[1]: 2.5; params[2]: 5.6; params[3]: 5.6; params[4]: -5.6; params[5]: 3.6; params[6]: -5.3; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 2.7; params[9]: 2.9.

This hasn't been tried in the examples provided. Let's check the examples again. The 127.00 example had params[0]: -4.8, but other parameters were different. So this is a new set. That could be a good candidate for exploration.
