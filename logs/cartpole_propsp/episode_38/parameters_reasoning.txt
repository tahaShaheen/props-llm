SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

Now you are at iteration 38 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of training examples with their corresponding episodic rewards. The goal is to find the optimal parameters for the linear policy in the CartPole environment. The current iteration is 38 out of 400, so there's still a lot of room for exploration.

Looking at the examples, the highest reward so far is 398.45. But the user mentioned that the global optimum should be around 500, so we need to explore more. The previous parameters mostly have values around 5-6 for some parameters, but maybe there's a combination that hasn't been tried yet.

The key here is to explore new parameter values with a step size of 1.0 as instructed. Let's check the parameters in the examples. For instance, params[0] is often 5 or 6. Maybe trying a lower value, like 4 or even 3, could lead to better results. Similarly, some parameters like params[2] are negative, but maybe varying them more could help.

Also, looking at the bias terms (params[8] and params[9]), they are often around 5-6. Perhaps adjusting them to lower values might influence the policy differently. Since the exploration step is 1.0, I should consider changing some parameters by +/- 1.0 from the current ones.

Another thing to note is that some parameters are repeated, like params[1] being 0.3 in several cases. Maybe varying that to other values, like 1.0 or -0.7, could lead to better exploration. Also, params[3] and params[7] are often around 6, but maybe increasing them to 7.0 (though the range is up to 6.0) isn't allowed. Wait, the parameters are in the range [-6.0, 6.0], so 6.0 is the max. So maybe trying 6.0 for some and lower for others.

I need to ensure that the proposed parameters haven't been used before. Looking through the examples, there's a params[0]: 6; params[1]: 0.3; params[2]: -4; params[3]: 6; etc. Maybe changing params[2] to -6, which hasn't been tried yet. Also, maybe adjusting params[6] from -6 to something else, like -5, but that's already in some examples.

Wait, the user said not to propose previously seen params. So I need to check which combinations are new. Let's think of changing some parameters that haven't been varied much. For example, in the examples, params[4] and params[5] are around 4.3 and 1.7. Maybe increasing params[4] to 5.3 or 6.0, and params[5] to 2.7. But that's already in some examples.

Alternatively, trying to set some parameters to negative values where they haven't been. For example, params[1] is mostly positive, but maybe trying -1.0. Also, params[8] and params[9] are often 5-6, but maybe setting them to lower values like 3.0 or 4.0.

Another approach is to look for parameters that are not frequently used. For instance, in the examples, params[6] is often -6, but maybe changing that to -5. Also, params[7] is around 6.2 in some cases, but the max is 6.0. Wait, the user said the parameters are in the range [-6.0, 6.0], so 6.2 is invalid. But in the examples, there's a params[3]: 6.2, which might be a typo. However, the user might have made a mistake there, but I should stick to the given parameters.

Wait, the user mentioned that params are in the range [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place. So any value beyond that is invalid. But in the examples, some have 6.2, which is outside. Maybe that's a typo, but I should proceed with the given info.

So, considering that, I need to make sure all parameters are within [-6.0, 6.0]. Now, to generate new parameters, let's think of varying some of the parameters that are currently at the extremes. For example, if params[0] is 6, maybe reducing it to 5.0, but that's already in the examples. Alternatively, trying a new combination where some parameters are adjusted by 1.0 step.

Let me try to create a new set of parameters. Let's take the first example with the highest reward: params[0]:6, params[1]:0.3, params[2]:-4, params[3]:6, params[4]:4.3, params[5]:1.7, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:6, params[9]:6. Maybe changing params[2] from -4 to -5 (since that's a step of -1.0), and params[8] and params[9] to lower values. But I need to check if that's been done before. In the examples, there's a case where params[2] is -5 and params[8] and params[9] are 5.3 and 4.8. So maybe trying params[2] as -6, which hasn't been used yet.

Alternatively, let's consider changing some of the other parameters. For instance, params[1] is 0.3, maybe changing it to 1.3 or -0.7. But that's already in some examples. Let me think of a new combination where some parameters are adjusted by 1.0 step. For example, increasing params[0] from 6 to 6 (already max), so can't. Maybe decreasing params[0] to 5, but that's already in examples. What about changing params[3] from 6 to 5.0? That's a step of -1.0. But that's not been done in the examples yet? Wait, looking at the examples, there's a case where params[3] is 5.2. So maybe 5.0 is a new value.

Alternatively, let's try to create a new set where params[2] is -6 (not seen before), params[3] is 6.0, params[4] is 5.3 (as in one example), params[5] is 2.7, params[6] is -6, params[7] is 6.0, and the bias terms (params[8] and params[9]) are 5.0 and 5.0. That might be a new combination.

So, putting it all together:

params[0]: 5.0 (since 6 is already tried, maybe step down)
params[1]: 1.3 (as in one example, but maybe try a new value)
Wait, but I need to ensure that the new parameters haven't been used before. This is tricky. Maybe the best approach is to take the highest reward example and perturb some parameters by +/-1.0 step. For example, take the first example (params with 398.45) and change params[2] from -4 to -5, params[8] from 6 to 5, and params[9] from 6 to 5. That would be a new set of parameters not seen before.

So:

params[0]:6, params[1]:0.3, params[2]:-5, params[3]:6, params[4]:4.3, params[5]:1.7, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:5, params[9]:5.

Wait, this is similar to one of the examples, which had params[8]:5 and params[9]:5 with a reward of 357.10. So that's already been tried. So that's not allowed.

Hmm экс. Let's try changing another parameter. Maybe params[4] from 4.3 to 5.3 (a step of +1.0). So:

params[0]:6, params[1]:0.3, params[2]:-4, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:1.7, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:6, params[9]:6.

This combination hasn't been seen in the examples yet. Let me check the examples. There's one where params[4] is 5.3 and params[5] is 2.7, but here params[5] is 1.7. So this is a new combination. That might be a good candidate for exploration.
