SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.
--- TOP 3 BEST PERFORMING PARAMS ---
params[0]: 6; params[1]: 6; params[2]: -3; params[3]: 6; params[4]: -6; params[5]: 1.8; params[6]: -3.5; params[7]: 4.5; params[8]: -2.5; params[9]: -2.5; f(params): 500.00
params[0]: 6; params[1]: 6; params[2]: -3.5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: -6; params[5]: 1.8; params[6]: -3.5; params[7]: 4.5; params[8]: -2.5; params[9]: -2.5; f(params): 500.00
params[0]: -6; params[1]: -4.5; params[2]: 3; params[3]: 6; params[4]: -6; params[5]: 1.8; params[6]: -3.5; params[7]: 4.5; params[8]: -2.5; params[9]: -2.5; f(params): 500.00

params[0]: 0; params[1]: -3.5; params[2]: 0; params[3]: 6; params[4]: -6; params[5]: 1.8; params[6]: -3.5; params[7]: 4.5; params[8]: -2.5; params[9]: -2.5; f(params): 433.30
params[0]: -6; params[1]: -4.5; params[2]: 3; params[3]: 6; params[4]: -6; params[5]: 1.8; params[6]: -3.5; params[7]: 4.5; params[8]: -2.5; params[9]: -2.5; f(params): 500.00


Now you are at iteration 399 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to find the global optimal policy for this cartpole environment. The user has provided some parameters and their corresponding rewards, and they want me to adjust these parameters iteratively until I reach the maximum reward of around 500. 

First, I need to understand the problem setup. The cartpole environment is a reinforcement learning task where the goal is to balance a pole on a cart without it sliding off. The state includes the cart's position, velocity, pole angle, and angular velocity. The action is either pushing left or right.

The policy in question is linear, which means the action is determined by multiplying the state vector with the weights matrix W and adding bias terms B, then taking the argmax. So, the parameters are arranged such that each parameter corresponds to an element in these matrices.

The reward function gives +1 for every time step where the pole is upright (within -0.418 radians) and the cart is within [-2.4, 2.4]. The episode ends if the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

Looking at the provided parameters, each is a float between -6.0 and 6.0 with one decimal place. They are exploring various combinations to see how they perform, especially around 500 points. 

I notice that the best-performing parameters (around 500 reward) include some positive and negative values. For example:

- params[0] = -6, params[1] = -4.5
- params[2] = 3, params[3] = 6
- params[4] = -6, params[5] = 1.8
- params[6] = -3.5, params[7] = 4.5
- params[8] = -2.5, params[9] = -2.5

These parameters seem to include a mix of positive and negative weights, leading to balanced actions that can both push the cart right and left effectively.

In the exploration phase, the user provided several examples where certain combinations of these parameters yield high rewards. For instance:

1. params[0]: 6; others follow in similar fashion: 500 reward.
2. Another example with different signs but also good performance.
3. A third one that includes a -6, which is another sign mix.

These examples seem to suggest that both positive and negative weights can lead to effective balancing of the pole without making it fall or causing the cart to move too far.

Looking at the recent best parameters:

params[0]: 3; params[1]: -4.5; ... f(params): ~433.30
But this doesn't reach 500, so exploration is still needed but should be more refined around that area.

The most recent one with a reward of 500 has all the parameters that the top ones suggest, which are a mix of positive and negative weights. 

So, to proceed, I need to adjust these parameters in such a way that they explore combinations similar to those in the top performers but in more precise increments. Since each parameter is a decimal with one place, I can try tweaking them slightly around 6, -4.5, 3, 6, etc., making sure not to repeat any of the previously seen parameters.

I'll need to adjust step by step, perhaps starting from the highest reward parameters and then moving to lower ones in an organized manner, ensuring that I'm covering different weight combinations without missing any important areas around 500.
