SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to set up the parameters for this cartpole environment. The goal is to get a high reward by keeping the pole upright and the cart within bounds. 

First, looking at the policy: it's linear with 18 parameters. Each action is either -4.5 or +2.4 based on push left or right. That seems like a reasonable range since the cart can move between -4.8 to 4.8, but the actions are capped.

The reward function gives +1 for every time step where the pole is upright and cart is within bounds. So we want as long a run of rewards as possible without failing in those conditions.

Looking at the parameters given: params[0] ranges from -6.0 to 6.0 with one decimal place, same for others. The global optimum should be around 500 reward points out of 400 steps. So we need a lot of good rewards but also make sure the policy doesn't fail.

Hmm, the best performing params in the examples have some high and low values. For example, one had params[2] = 1.5, which is positive, others varied more. The ones with higher params[8], like -3.5 or 4.5 seem important since they affect pole angular velocity.

I think I should focus on increasing the reward potential while keeping the cart within bounds and the pole upright. Maybe set up parameters to push both left and right a bit more, but not too much that it overshoots. Also, maybe adjust some of the middle params like W[0][1] or B[1], which are involved in balancing the velocity.

I should also consider the environment's dynamics. The pole needs to stay upright, so the policy shouldn't have any instability issues. Maybe increase parameters related to pole angle and angular velocity to better stabilize it.

Wait, but I'm not sure how each parameter affects the overall reward. Let me think: action choice could be more important than just the state variables. So perhaps making the actions more varied within their range might help balance the policy and prevent it from getting stuck in local optima.

Also, maybe increase some of the middle params to improve velocity handling but not so much that they cause the cart to move too far. For example, increasing W[3][0] or B[1], which are for pole angular velocity and velocity, could help maintain balance.

I should also make sure that during training, we're not getting stuck in local optima by using more exploration or different parameter ranges, but since it's a deterministic reward function, maybe just focusing on the ones that affect the key dynamics will be better.

So putting this all together: set params[0] and [1] to higher values (like 2.4) for both actions, parameters around -3.5 for W to increase pole angle stabilization, and adjust B[0], which affects velocity, towards more positive values to help push the cart as needed. That should give a good balance of reward potential while keeping the pole upright and the cart within bounds.
