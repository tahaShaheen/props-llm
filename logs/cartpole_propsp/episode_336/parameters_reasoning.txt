SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 336 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out the next step here. So, the user is working on optimizing a linear policy for the CartPole environment. They've provided a bunch of previous parameter sets and their corresponding rewards. The goal is to find the global optimum, which they mention should be around 500. The current iteration is 336 out of 400, so there's still some time left.

Looking at the examples given, most of the high-reward parameters (around 500) have params[0] at 6, params[1] around 2.3, params[2] at -5, params[3] around 6, params[4] and [5] around 5.3-6, params[6] at -6, params[7] around 6, and params[8] and [9] around 5. But there are some variations, like in one case params[3] is 5 instead of 6, and params[8] is 5.1. However, those variations seem to lower the reward slightly.

The user mentioned that during exploration, a step size of 1.0 should be used. So maybe I need to perturb some of the parameters that are close to the current high-performing ones. Let's see which parameters might be candidates for adjustment. For example, params[4] is currently around 5.3 in the top examples. If I increase it to 6, but looking at one of the examples where params[4] is 6, the reward was 430.45, which is lower. Hmm, that's unexpected. Wait, maybe that's a different parameter set. Let me check again.

Wait, in the example with params[4]: 6, the reward was 430.45. That's lower than the 500s. So maybe increasing params[4] beyond 5.3 isn't helpful. Alternatively, maybe there's another parameter that can be adjusted. Let's look at params[7]. In some examples, it's 6, but in one case it was 5, leading to a lower reward. So maybe keeping params[7] at 6 is better.

Looking at params[8] and [9], they are mostly around 5. In one example, params[8] was 5.1 and params[9] was 5, which gave a slightly lower reward. Another example had params[8] at 6 and params[9] at 5, which dropped the reward to 345.70. So keeping those around 5 seems better.

What about params[2]? It's consistently at -5 in the high-reward examples. Maybe that's a critical parameter. What if I try changing params[1]? In one example, it was 3.3 instead of 2.3, but that gave a lower reward (400.40). So maybe 2.3 is better for params[1].

Looking at params[6], it's -6 in most high-reward cases. Changing that to -5 in one example led to a lower reward. So keeping params[6] at -6 is probably good.

What about params[3]? It's 6 in most cases. Maybe trying a different value here? But in one case, when it was 5, the reward was lower. So maybe 6 is better.

Hmm, so the current high-performing parameters are mostly clustered around certain values. But the user wants to explore to find the global optimum. Since the current best is around 500, but the global optimum is supposed to be around 500, maybe we need to check if there's any parameter that can be adjusted slightly to get a better result.

Wait, the user said that if you're below 500, you should explore instead of exploit. But in the examples provided, some of the top ones are exactly at 500. So maybe the global optimum is already found, but the user is still looking for it. Alternatively, maybe there's a better combination.

Wait, the user says the global optimum should be around 500. So perhaps the current examples have already reached that. But maybe there's a way to tweak some parameters to get slightly higher. However, all the examples with 500 are very similar. Let me check if there are any parameters that are on the edge of the allowed range. For example, params[0] is 6, which is the maximum allowed. Maybe adjusting that slightly? But the user says to use a step size of 1.0 during exploration. So maybe trying to change some parameters by +/-1.0 from their current values.

Wait, the current high-performing parameters have params[0] at 6, which is the upper bound. Maybe trying to decrease it by 1.0 to 5.0. But that might lower the reward. Alternatively, maybe increasing some other parameter. Let me think about which parameters are not at their extremes. For example, params[1] is 2.3, which is within the range. Maybe trying to adjust that by +/-1.0. Let's say 2.3 +1.0 = 3.3, but in one example, that led to a lower reward. What about 2.3 -1.0 = 1.3? Maybe that's untested.

Alternatively, looking at params[4] which is around 5.3. If I increase that by 1.0 to 6.3, but that's beyond the allowed range (max is 6.0). So maybe 6.0. But in one example, when params[4] was 6, the reward was lower. So maybe not helpful.

What about params[2], which is -5. If I change that to -6 (the lower bound), but that's already at -5. Wait, the allowed range is [-6.0, 6.0]. So maybe trying -6 for params[2]. Let me check if that's been tried. In the examples, params[2] is -5. So changing it to -6 might be a new exploration.

So, let's consider perturbing params[2] from -5 to -6. Let's see what that might do. Also, maybe other parameters. Let's think of a few parameters to adjust. Since the user wants to explore with step size 1.0, I need to pick parameters that are in the current high-performing set and adjust them by +/-1.0.

Another candidate is params[8], which is 5. If I change that to 6 (since 5+1=6), but in one example, when params[8] was 6, the reward was 345.70, which is lower. So that's worse. What about changing it to 4 (5-1=4)? Maybe that's untested.

Alternatively, params[9] is 5. Changing it to 6 or 4. Let's try that. But again, need to check if that's been done. In one example, params[9] was 6, and the reward was 356.80, which is lower. So maybe not helpful.

What about params[7], which is 6. If I decrease it to 5, but that was tried and resulted in lower reward. So maybe not helpful.

Hmm. Maybe looking at other parameters. Let's see. What about params[5], which is 6. If I decrease it to 5, but that's not in the examples. Let me check if that's been tried. No, in the examples, params[5] is 6. So maybe trying to adjust that. But again, with step size 1.0, changing to 5 or 7 (but 7 is beyond the max of 6.0). So 5.0.

Alternatively, maybe params[3] is 6. Changing it to 5 or 7 (but 7 is invalid). So 5. But that was tried and resulted in lower reward.

So, the only parameters that haven't been adjusted much are params[2], params[1], and maybe params[8] and [9]. Let's consider adjusting params[2] to -6 (since it's currently -5). Let's try that. So, params[2] = -6.0. Also, maybe adjust params[1] to 1.3 (2.3-1.0) or 3.3 (2.3+1.0). But 3.3 was tried and gave lower reward. So maybe trying 1.3.

Alternatively, maybe adjusting params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3 (but that's beyond the max, so 6.0). But in one example, when params[4] was 6, the reward was lower. So that might not be helpful.

Another thought: the current high-performing parameters have params[0] at 6.0, which is the maximum. Maybe trying to decrease it by 1.0 to 5.0, but that might lower the reward. However, since the user is at iteration 336, and there are 64 steps left, maybe it's worth exploring.

Alternatively, maybe trying to adjust params[8] or [9] to 4.0 or 6.0, but those have been tried with lower rewards.

Wait, the user said that during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So, perhaps pick a parameter that is in the current high-performing set and adjust it by +/-1.0. Let's pick params[2] (-5) and change it to -6.0. Let's also adjust params[1] (2.3) to 3.3 (but that was tried and gave lower reward). Alternatively, maybe adjust params[1] to 1.3. Let's try that.

So, the new params could be:

params[0]: 6.0 (unchanged)
params[1]: 1.3 (changed from 2.3)
params[2]: -6.0 (changed from -5)
params[3]: 6.0 (unchanged)
params[4]: 5.3 (unchanged)
params[5]: 6.0 (unchanged)
params[6]: -6.0 (unchanged)
params[7]: 6.0 (unchanged)
params[8]: 5.0 (unchanged)
params[9]: 5.0 (unchanged)

This would be a new set of parameters that haven't been tried before. Alternatively, maybe changingﹶ

Okay, I think the best approach here is to pick one parameter that's in the current high-performing set and adjust it by +/-1.0. Let's go with params[2], changing it from -5 to -6.0. Let's also check if that's within the allowed range. Yes, since the minimum is -6.0.

So, the proposed parameters would be:

params[0]: 6.0
params[1]: 2.3
params[2]: -6.0
params[3]: 6.0
params[4]: 5.3
params[5]: 6.0
params[6]: -6.0
params[7]: 6.0
params[8]: 5.0
params[9]: 5.0

This is a new combination that hasn't been tested in the examples provided. It changes params[2] to -6.0. This could be a good candidate for exploration.
