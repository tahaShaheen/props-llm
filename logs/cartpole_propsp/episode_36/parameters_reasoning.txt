SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 36 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to optimize the parameters for a linear policy in the CartPole environment. They provided a bunch of previous attempts with their corresponding rewards. The goal is to reach around 500 reward, which is higher than the current examples.

Looking at the examples, the highest reward is 398.45. That's pretty close to 500, but not there yet. The user mentioned that if we're below 500, we should explore more instead of exploiting. So, maybe the current parameters are in a local optimum, and we need to try different values.

The parameters are in ranges of [-6.0, 6.0] with one decimal place. The previous examples have a lot of parameters around 6, 5, and some negatives. The B terms (params 8 and 9) are often 5-6. Maybe the bias terms are important here. Also, looking at the weights, some of them are high, like params[3] and [7] are often 6.2 or 6. Maybe increasing those could help?

But since we need to explore, perhaps we should make some changes with a step size of 1.0. For example, if a parameter was 6, maybe try 5 or 7 (but 7 is out of range). Wait, the max is 6.0. So maybe decrease some parameters that are at 6 to 5, or increase others. Alternatively, flip some signs.

Looking at the first example: params[0] is 6, params[1] 0.3, params[2] -4, params[3] 6. Maybe trying to adjust params[2] from -4 to -5 or -3. Also, params[6] is -6, maybe changing that to -5 or -7 (but again, -7 is out of range). So maybe -5?

Another thought: the policy is a linear function, so the weights and biases determine the action. The action is the argmax of the linear combination. To keep the pole upright, the policy needs to adjust the cart's position and velocity. Maybe the parameters related to the pole angle and angular velocity are crucial. For instance, params[4] and [5] (which are for pole angle and angular velocity) in the first example are 4.3 and 1.7. Maybe increasing those could help?

But since we need to explore, let's think about making some parameters more extreme. For example, if params[3] is 6, maybe try 5.2 (as in some examples) or 6.2. Wait, but in the first example, params[3] is 6, and the reward is 398.45. Maybe trying to increase that to 6.2? But some other examples have that and lower rewards. Hmm.

Alternatively, looking at the bias terms. In the first example, params[8] and [9] are both 6. Maybe increasing them further isn't possible, but maybe decreasing them. But that might not be helpful. Alternatively, adjusting the weights.

Wait, the user said during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So if a parameter is at 6, maybe try 5 (step down by 1). If it's at -6, try -5. Let's pick some parameters to adjust.

Looking at the first example again: params[0] is 6. Maybe try 5.0. params[2] is -4. Maybe try -5.0. params[6] is -6, so try -5.0. Also, params[8] and [9] are 6. Maybe try 5.0. Let's make those changes.

So, new params would be:

params[0]: 5.0 (from 6.0)
params[2]: -5.0 (from -4.0)
params[6]: -5.0 (from -6.0)
params[8]: 5.0 (from 6.0)
params[9]: 5.0 (from 6.0)

Other parameters could stay the same. Let's check if that's within the range and with one decimal. Yes, all values are within [-6,6] and have one decimal. Also, this is a new set of parameters not seen before. That should be a good exploration step.
