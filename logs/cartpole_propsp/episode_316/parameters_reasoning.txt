SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 316 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help someone who's working on optimizing a cartpole environment using reinforcement learning. The goal is to find the parameters of a linear policy that maximize the episodic reward. They've set up some initial examples and want me to propose new parameters based on those.

First, I need to understand the problem setup. The state includes cart position, velocity, pole angle, and angular velocity. The action is either pushing left or right. The reward increases by 1 each time step when the pole is upright and the cart is within bounds.

They've provided several examples of parameters and their corresponding rewards. These seem to suggest that certain combinations can achieve high rewards, around 500. But they want more optimal values closer to 500. So my task is to find better parameters in that vicinity.

Looking at the first example, params[0] is 6, others range from -6.0 to 6.0. The reward there is 500.00. Another example has some negative and positive values but still gives 500.00. One with lower reward (455.55) suggests that maybe not all parameters are being utilized optimally.

Since the optimal region is around 500, I should aim to push further in that area without going too far out of it. Perhaps some parameters can be increased a bit while others might need adjustment to prevent exceeding the bounds (like cart position beyond -2.4 or pole angle below -0.418 rad).

I'll start by incrementally increasing params[0] and see how the reward changes, but not so much that the cart goes out of bounds. I'll also try adjusting other parameters around their initial values to maintain stability.

After a few iterations, if the reward doesn't improve significantly, I might need to explore more in that area or consider some negative adjustments to prevent oscillations. Maybe even slightly decreasing some parameters could help achieve a higher reward without pushing others too high.

I'll structure my proposed parameters to be within the range but optimized for reward maximization, ensuring the cart stays within bounds as well.
