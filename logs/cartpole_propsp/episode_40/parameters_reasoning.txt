SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 40 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of training examples with different params and their corresponding f(params) values. The goal is to find the global optimum, which they mentioned should be around 500. The current examples have values up to 398.45, so there's definitely room for improvement.

Looking at the examples, some patterns emerge. For instance, params[0], [3], [6], [7], [8], and [9] often have high values like 6, 6.2, 5.3, etc. Others like params[2] and [6] sometimes have negative values, like -6. But the highest reward so far is 398.45. Since the global optimum is supposed to be around 500, we need to explore more.

The user mentioned that during exploration, a search step size of 1.0 should be used. So, maybe we can take some of the higher-performing parameters and adjust them by +/-1.0 to see if we can get a better reward. For example, the first example has params[0] at 6, which is already the max. Maybe increasing params[3] from 6 to 7? But wait, the params are supposed to be in the range [-6.0, 6.0], so 7.2 is out of bounds. Wait, looking at the examples, some have values like 6.2 or 7.2. Wait, the user said params are in the range [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place. But some examples have values like 6.2 or 7.2, which would be outside the range. That's conflicting. Wait, maybe that's a mistake in the examples? Or maybe the user made a typo. Hmm, but the user said params are in [-6.0, 6.0], so maybe those examples are incorrect. But assuming they are correct, perhaps the actual allowed range is up to 6.0, and those examples have errors. But I need to follow the user's instruction that params are in [-6.0, 6.0], so I can't go beyond that.

So, looking at the first example: params[0] is 6, which is the max. Maybe adjusting other parameters. For instance, in the first example, params[2] is -4. Maybe increasing that to -3 or -5? But since we need to explore, maybe try changing some parameters by +/-1.0. Let's pick a parameter that's in the middle. For example, in the first example, params[1] is 0.3. Maybe increasing it to 1.3 or decreasing to -0.7. But the user said to use a step size of 1.0 during exploration, so changing by 1.0. Let's see.

Another approach: looking at the parameters that have higher rewards. The first example has a reward of 398.45. Let's take that as a base. Maybe tweak some of the parameters. For example, in that example, params[2] is -4. If we increase that to -3 (adding 1.0), or decrease to -5 (subtracting 1.0). Also, looking at params[4] and [5], which are 4.3 and 1.7. Maybe adjusting those. Also, the bias terms B are 6 and 6. Maybe adjusting those as well.

Wait, the user said to search both positive and negative values. So, for each parameter, we can try adding and subtracting 1.0. But since we need to avoid previously seen params, we have to check if the new combination has been used before. However, the user hasn't provided all previous params, just the top ones. So, maybe it's safe to explore new combinations.

Let me think of a possible new set. Let's take the first example and adjust some parameters. For instance, increase params[3] from 6 to 6.0 (already at max), so can't. Maybe decrease params[2] from -4 to -5. Also, check other parameters. Maybe increase params[4] from 4.3 to 5.3 (adding 1.0). Similarly, params[5] from 1.7 to 2.7. Also, check the bias terms. In the first example, B is 6 and 6. Maybe lower them to 5.3 and 5.3, as in another example. But that example had lower reward. Alternatively, keep them at 6.

Another idea: look at the parameters that have higher values. For example, in the first example, params[0] is 6, params[3] is 6, params[6] is -6, params[7] is 6, and B is 6 and 6. Maybe adjusting params[6] from -6 to -5. Let's try that. So, params[6] becomes -5. Also, maybe adjust params[4] and [5] as mentioned before.

Putting it all together, a possible new params set could be:

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 0.3, params[2]: -5, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 5.3, params[5]: 2.7, params[6]: -5, params[7]: 6, params[8]: 6, params[9]: 6.

But wait, this is similar to one of the examples with a lower reward. Let me check. Yes, in the third example, params[0] is 6, params[1] is 0.3, params[2] is -5, params[3] is 6, params[4] is 5.3, params[5] is 2.7, params[6] is -6, params[7] is 6, params[8] is 5, params[9] is 5. That had a reward of 357.10. So if I change params[6] from -6 to -5, and params[8] and [9] from 5 to 6, maybe that's a new combination. Let's try that. So:

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 0.3, params[2]: -5, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 5.3, params[5]: 2.7, params[6]: -5, params[7]: 6, params[8]: 6, params[9]: 6.

This hasn't been tried before in the examples provided. Let's check if that's a valid move. The user said to use a step size of 1.0 during exploration, so changing params[6] from -6 to -5 is a +1.0 step. Also, params[8] and [9] from 5 to 6 is +1.0. So this seems like a valid exploration step. This might lead to a higher reward.
