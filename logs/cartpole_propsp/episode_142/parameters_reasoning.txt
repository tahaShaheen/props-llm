SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help this cartpole environment problem where they're asking me to find the global optimal policy using a linear policy. Let's see... The user has given some parameters and their corresponding episodic rewards.

First, the state is [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity], and the action space is two actions: push left (0) or push right (1). The reward is +1 every time step if the pole is upright and the cart is within bounds. Otherwise, it ends the episode.

Looking at the params provided in the examples, like [-4.5, -4.5, 1.5, etc.], and their rewards: some are around 300-402 points. The user wants me to choose a set of params values that maximize f(params) with each step.

So, I need to think about what affects the reward. The cart's position is crucial—being closer to -2.4 or 2.4 gives more reward. Also, if the pole stays upright and cart is within bounds, better reward. If the cart goes out of bounds or pole falls over, it ends the episode with lower rewards.

I notice that in some examples, params[0] are around -5, which seems to be pushing the cart as far left as possible, but not too negative so the cart doesn't go too right. That might encourage keeping the pole upright and cart within bounds longer.

Also, looking at some params like [-5; 2.4; 0.8; etc.] where the pole is slightly off but with velocity positive—so pushing it back up a bit. But in others, it's more leftward without too much right movement, which could help in keeping the pole upright.

I think that perhaps having params where cart is as far left as possible (params[0] = -5) and params[1] around 2.4 might keep the cart within bounds while also pushing it to the left. That way, for each step, the reward increases because of the cart being closer to the boundaries.

But I should check if that's the case. The reward is +1 per step where pole upright and cart in bounds. So, perhaps having more cart movement leftward (params[0]=-5) could give more rewards as the cart stays within bounds longer.

I also need to make sure not to repeat any params that have been seen before, so I should choose values that aren't already taken by others. Maybe around -4.5 or slightly less but different from some parameters given in the examples.

Wait, looking at an example: [-5; 2.4; ...], which is more left and a bit right velocity. Another example has params[0]=-4.5, but [1]=-4.5 as well. Maybe it's better to spread out the values or vary them more.

I think I'll go for params that push the cart as far left as possible (like -5) and have some positive velocity to keep pushing it left. That could maximize the reward because the cart stays within bounds longer, keeping the pole upright each step.

So, maybe set params[0] = -5, params[1] around 2.4, which is slightly more than in the example given (since it's not repeating), and the others vary a bit to see if that affects performance. But I need to make sure that the reward isn't just based on the params but also on how the pole behaves.

In some examples, params[3] is around 0.7 or -0.7 which might affect pole stability. Maybe having more leftward movement helps keep the pole upright because there's less chance for it to fall over quickly.

So, putting it all together, I think setting params like [-5.0; 2.4; ...] would encourage the cart to move as far left as possible, which should give higher rewards since the cart stays within bounds longer and the pole is more likely to stay upright. 

I also need to ensure that this isn't just a local maximum but actually leads to the global optimum. So, testing with different params around -5 might show if moving too much left causes the cart to go out of bounds or the pole to fall over more.

Overall, balancing pushing the cart left and keeping its position within bounds for as long as possible should be key.
