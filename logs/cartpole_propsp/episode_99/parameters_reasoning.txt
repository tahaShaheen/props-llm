SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 99 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to optimize the parameters for a linear policy in the CartPole environment. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward, which they mentioned should be around 500. The current examples show that the best so far is 492.00. But they want to reach higher.

Looking at the top params, the ones with higher rewards have params like params[0] and params[1] at 6 and 1.3, params[2] and [3] at -6 and 6, and similar patterns for the other weights. The bias terms (params[8] and [9]) are also high, like 6. But some of the lower-performing ones have lower values or different combinations.

The user mentioned that if they're below 500, they should explore instead of exploit. So maybe the current params are in a local optimum. The exploration step size is 1.0. So, I should consider changing some parameters by +/-1.0 from the current best.

Looking at the best params so far: params[0] is 6, which is already at the max of 6.0. Maybe that's not changeable. But other parameters like params[2] is -6, which is also at the minimum. Perhaps changing some of the other parameters. For example, params[4] is 5.3, which could be increased to 6.3 (but wait, the range is [-6.0, 6.0], so 6.3 is invalid). So maybe increase to 6.0. Similarly, params[5] is 5.7, which could be 6.0. But in the current top examples, some have params[4] and [5] at 5.3 and 5.7, and others at 6.0. Maybe adjusting those.

Alternatively, looking at the other parameters. For instance, params[6] is -6, and params[7] is 6. Maybe changing params[6] to -5 or -7 (but -7 is out of range). So maybe -5. But the current best has params[6] at -6. Maybe that's part of the optimal.

Wait, the user said during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So for each parameter, we can adjust by +/-1.0 from the current value. Let's take the current best params: [6, 1.3, -6, 6, 5.3, 5.7, -6, 6, 6, 6]. Let's see which parameters can be adjusted.

Starting with params[0] (6.0), can't go higher. Maybe lower by 1.0 to 5.0. But that might decrease performance. However, since we're exploring, maybe trying that. Similarly, params[1] is 1.3. Adding 1.0 would make it 2.3, which is within range. Maybe that's a possibility. But the example with params[1] at 2.3 had a lower reward (380.40), so that might not be good. But maybe other parameters.

Looking at params[4] (5.3). Adding 0.7 would make it 6.0. But since the step size is 1.0, maybe changing it to 6.3 is not allowed. So the next possible is 6.0. So changing params[4] from 5.3 to 6.0. Similarly, params[5] is 5.7, changing to 6.0.

Alternatively, maybe adjusting the bias terms. The current best has params[8] and [9] at 6.0. Maybe lowering them by 1.0 to 5.0? But that might reduce the reward. However, exploration requires trying different steps.

Another approach is to look for parameters that are not at the extremes. For example, params[1] is 1.3, which is not at the maximum. Maybe increasing it by 1.0 to 2.3. But as before, that example had lower reward. However, maybe other parameters can be adjusted.

Alternatively, looking at params[2] and [3], which are -6 and 6. Maybe changing params[2] to -5 and params[3] to 5. But that might decrease performance. However, since we need to explore, perhaps trying that.

Another thought: the current best has params[4] and [5] at 5.3 and 5.7. Maybe increasing params[4] to 6.3 (but that's over the limit). So 6.0. Similarly, params[5] to 6.0. Let's try that. So changing params[4] to 6.0 and params[5] to 6.0. Also, maybe adjusting params[6] and [7], but they are already at -6 and 6.

So, modifying the current best params:

params[0]: 6.0 (unchanged)
params[1]: 1.3 (unchanged)
params[2]: -6.0 (unchanged)
params[3]: 6.0 (unchanged)
params[4]: 6.0 (was 5.3)
params[5]: 6.0 (was 5.7)
params[6]: -6.0 (unchanged)
params[7]: 6.0 (unchanged)
params[8]: 6.0 (unchanged)
params[9]: 6.0 (unchanged)

But this might be a possible move. However, since the step size is 1.0, changing params[4] from 5.3 to 6.0 is a step of +0.7, which is less than 1.0. Wait, the step size is 1.0, so perhaps we can only change parameters by ±1.0. So for params[4], changing from 5.3 to 6.3 is not allowed. But to 6.0 is a step of +0.7, which is within the step size? Or does the step size mean that each parameter is adjusted by exactly ±1.0? The user said during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So perhaps for each parameter, we can adjust it by ±1.0. So for example, if a parameter is 5.3, adding 1.0 would make it 6.3, which is outside the range. So in that case, the adjustment would be to the maximum allowed value (6.0). Similarly, subtracting 1.0 from 5.3 would be 4.3.

So, for exploration, we can take the current best parameters and adjust each parameter by ±1.0, clamping to the [-6.0, 6.0] range. Let's take the current best params and try adjusting each parameter once.

Current best: [6, 1.3, -6, 6, 5.3, 5.7, -6, 6, 6, 6]

Let's adjust each parameter by +1.0 and -1.0, but within the range.

For params[0] (6.0): +1.0 is invalid, so can't increase. -1.0 would be 5.0.

params[1] (1.3): +1.0 → 2.3; -1.0 → 0.3.

params[2] (-6.0): +1.0 → -5.0; -1.0 → -7.0 (invalid, so -6.0).

params[3] (6.0): +1.0 invalid; -1.0 → 5.0.

params[4] (5.3): +1.0 → 6.3 (clamped to 6.0); -1.0 → 4.3.

params[5] (5.7): +1.0 → 6.7 (clamped to 6.0); -1.0 → 4.7.

params[6] (-6.0): same as params[2], can only increase to -5.0.

params[7] (6.0): same as params[3], can only decrease to 5.0.

params[8] (6.0): same as params[0], can only decrease to 5.0.

params[9] (6.0): same as above, decrease to 5.0.

So possible new parameters by adjusting one parameter each:

Option 1: params[0] = 5.0 (others same)
Option 2: params[1] = 2.3 (others same)
Option 3: params[1] = 0.3 (others same)
Option 4: params[2] = -5.0 (others same)
Option 5: params[3] = 5.0 (others same)
Option 6: params[4] = 6.0 (others same)
Option 7: params[4] = 4.3 (others same)
Option 8: params[5] = 6.0 (others same)
Option 9: params[5] = 4.[PAD151736]
