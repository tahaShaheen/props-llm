SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 137 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of training examples with different params and their corresponding episodic rewards. The goal is to find the global optimal policy, which should be around 500. The current highest reward from the examples is 497.35. The user is at iteration 137 out of 400, so there's still a lot of steps left.

First, I need to look at the params that gave the highest rewards. The top one is params[0]:6, params[1]:1.3, params[2]:-6, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:6, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:6, params[9]:6 with f=497.35. Then there's another with params[1] as 2.3 giving 446.50, which is lower. So maybe increasing params[1] isn't the way to go here.

Looking at the other examples, some have lower values in params[2], like -5 instead of -6. But the highest reward example has params[2] at -6. However, other examples with params[2] at -5 have lower rewards. So maybe keeping params[2] at -6 is better. But the user mentioned that during exploration, a step size of 1.0 should be used. Since the current best is around 497, which is close to 500, maybe we need to explore nearby values.

Wait, the user said that if we're below 500, we should explore instead of exploit. So even though 497.35 is the highest so far, we need to look for other possibilities. The exploration step size is 1.0, so maybe adjusting some parameters by +/-1.0 from the current best.

Looking at the current best params: [6,1.3,-6,6,5.3,6,-6,6,6,6]. Let's consider changing some parameters. For example, params[1] is 1.3. If we increase it by 1.0 to 2.3, but that was tried and gave 446.50, which is worse. Maybe decreasing it? But 1.3 is already low. Alternatively, maybe changing other parameters.

Looking at params[4] which is 5.3. If we increase it by 1.0 to 6.3, but the params are limited to [-6.0,6.0], so 6.3 is invalid. So maybe 6.0. But the current value is 5.3. What if we set it to 6.0? Let's see. However, the current example with params[4] at 5.3 and params[5] at 6 gives 497.35. Maybe adjusting other parameters.

Another parameter is params[8] and params[9], which are both 6.0. If we lower them, maybe that affects the bias. But in the example where params[8] and [9] were 5, the reward was lower. So perhaps keeping them high is better.

Alternatively, looking at params[6], which is -6. If we change that to -5, but in some examples that led to lower rewards. Hmm.

Wait, maybe looking for parameters that have been underexplored. For instance, in the examples provided, most of the params are either 6 or -6, except for some like params[1] being 1.3. Maybe trying to vary other parameters. For example, params[0] is 6 in the best example. What if we lower it to 5? But in the second example, when params[0] was 5, the reward was 497.15, which is slightly lower. So maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, looking at params[3], which is 6. What if we lower that to 5? But in the second example, params[3] was 5, and the reward was 497.15, which is very close. So maybe not a big difference.

Another approach: check if any parameters are set to their extremes. For example, params[2] is -6, which is the minimum. Maybe trying to increase it to -5. But in the examples, when params[2] was -5, the reward was lower. However, since we need to explore, perhaps trying that. But the user said to explore with step size 1.0. So if the current value is -6, adding 1.0 would be -5. Let's consider that.

But since the user wants to avoid previously seen params, and in the examples, there are cases where params[2] was -5. So maybe that's already tried. Alternatively, perhaps changing other parameters.

Wait, looking at the current best, maybe changing params[7] from 6 to 5? But in the examples, when params[7] was 5, the reward was lower. However, again, we need to explore.

Alternatively, looking at params[4] and [5]. In the best example, params[4] is 5.3 and [5] is 6. Maybe increasing params[4] to 6.3 is not allowed, but 6.0. Let's try that. So params[4] becomes 6.0. Let's see. Also, maybe adjusting params[5] to something else.

But this is getting complicated. Since the user wants exploration with step size 1.0, perhaps take the current best and change one parameter by +/-1.0. For example, take the best params and change params[1] from 1.3 to 2.3 (but that was tried and gave lower reward). Or change params[1] to 0.3. But that's a step of -1.0. Maybe that's worth trying.

Alternatively, changing params[8] or [9] from 6 to 5. But that was tried and gave lower rewards. However, since we need to explore, perhaps trying that again. But the user said not to propose previously seen params. Wait, the user's instruction says "Do not propose previously seen params." So if a param combination was already in the training examples, we shouldn't repeat it. But in the examples, there are multiple entries with params[8] and [9] as 6. So maybe changing them to 5 is not previously seen? Wait, looking at the examples, there's one where params[8] and [9] were 5, which gave lower reward. But the user might have already tried that. However, the instruction says not to propose previously seen params. So if the current best has params[8] and [9] as 6, and other examples have them as 5, but we need to explore, perhaps trying other values.

Alternatively, looking for parameters that haven't been varied much. For example, params[0] is 6 in the best example. What if we set it to 5? But that was tried. Or maybe other parameters.

This is tricky. Maybe the best approach is to take the current best and make small changes to some parameters. For example, take the best params and change one parameter by +/-1.0. Let's pick params[4], which is 5.3. If we increase it by 1.0 to 6.3, but that's over the limit. So 6.0. Let's set params[4] to 6.0. Then, keep other parameters the same. That's a new param combination not seen before. Similarly, maybe changing params[5] from 6 to 5.0. But that might lower the reward.

Alternatively, changing params[2] from -6 to -5. But that was tried and gave lower reward. However, the user wants exploration, so maybe it's worth trying again. But the user said not to propose previously seen params. If that combination was already in the training examples, then we shouldn't. Looking back, there's an example where params[2] was -5 and others had similar values. So maybe that's already tried.

Hmm. Maybe the best way is to take the current best and change one parameter by 1.0 in a direction that hasn't been tried much. For example, params[3] is 6.0. If we lower it to 5.0. Let's see. That would be a new param combination. Let's try that. So the new params would be:

params[0]:6; params[1]:1.3; params[2]:-6; params[3]:5; params[4]:5.3; params[5]:6; params[6]:-6; params[7]:6; params[8]:6; params[9]:6.

This is a new combination not seen before. Let's propose this. The idea is to explore by changing params[3] from 6 to 5, which is a step of -1.0. This might lead to a better reward or not, but it's part of the exploration phase.
