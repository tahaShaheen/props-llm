SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 363 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out what parameters would maximize the reward in the cartpole environment. The user has given several examples and their corresponding rewards, all around 500 points. Each parameter is a float with one decimal place, ranging from -6.0 to 6.0.

First, I need to understand how these parameters influence the reward. From what I know, the reward is positive when the pole stays upright and the cart is within bounds. So, higher rewards are achieved by keeping the pole balanced and the cart stable.

Looking at the examples provided, some have all parameters as 6 or -3.5. For instance, params[0]:6, params[1]:6, etc., give a reward of around 500. Others mix positive and negative values, which might encourage different behaviors but still result in high rewards.

I should consider both promoting balance (pole upright) and keeping the cart within bounds. This suggests that parameters related to pole angle (params[2]) and cart velocity (params[1], params[3]) are important. Maybe increasing pole angle while also controlling pole velocity can lead to better performance.

Also, since each action space has two options, pushing left or right, perhaps the policy is influenced by how the actions balance these parameters. If one action leads to a higher reward than the other for certain parameter values, it might guide the policy towards that outcome.

Considering the user's examples, some have all pole angles as -3.5, which are lower (more unstable) but others mix different values. It seems that achieving a stable pole angle is crucial, so parameters related to pole angle might need careful tuning.

Additionally, cart velocity and pole angular velocity can affect how easily the cart moves or spins. Positive cart velocity could help keep the pole upright, while negative pole angular velocity would stabilize it. So, balancing these velocities could be key.

The user's examples also show that some have parameters like -6.0 for params[2], which might push the pole further down, but others compensate by having different values. This suggests that both positive and negative influences on the pole angle need to coexist for optimal performance.

In summary, I should look for parameter combinations where the pole is balanced (low or near zero pole angle), the cart isn't moving too fast or too slow (low or near zero velocity components), and the system doesn't tend to tip (low pole angular velocity). This setup would likely maximize the reward by keeping the pole upright and within bounds.
