SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

Now you are at iteration 127 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is working on optimizing a linear policy for the CartPole environment. They provided a bunch of previous parameters and their corresponding rewards. The goal is to get as close as possible to the global optimum of around 500. 

Looking at the examples given, the highest reward so far is 497.35. The user mentioned that if they're below 500, they should explore more instead of exploiting. So, even though the current best is 497, we need to try different parameters to potentially reach higher rewards.

The parameters are in the range [-6.0, 6.0] with one decimal place. The previous attempts have mostly used values around 5 and 6 for many parameters, especially the W matrix elements. However, maybe some negative values could help. For example, in some of the higher-reward examples, params[2] and params[6] are -6 or -5. But perhaps there's a combination where some other parameters are adjusted.

Since exploration is needed, I should consider varying some parameters that haven't been changed much. For instance, in the top examples, params[1] is 1.3 in most cases. Maybe increasing that to 2.3 or decreasing it could lead to better results. Also, looking at the most recent params, some have lower values like 5 instead of 6. Maybe adjusting some of the W elements from 6 to lower values, or changing the bias terms (params 8 and 9) from 6 to something else.

Another thing to note is that the policy uses argmax on the state multiplied by W plus B. So, the weights and biases influence the action selection. If the current parameters are pushing the cart too hard in one direction, maybe adjusting the velocity or angular velocity terms could help balance better.

I should generate a new set of parameters that vary some of the existing ones. For example, maybe increasing params[1] from 1.3 to 2.3 (as seen in one of the examples with lower reward, but maybe with other changes it could work), or adjusting params[4] and params[5] which are currently around 5.3 and 6. Maybe trying a different combination there.

Also, the user mentioned using a search step size of 1.0 during exploration. So, if a parameter is at 6, trying 5 or 7 (but 7 is outside the range, so 5). Similarly, for parameters at -6, trying -5.

Looking at the previous examples, the highest reward was with params[0] at 6, params[1] at 1.3, params[2] at -6, params[3] at 6, etc. Maybe changing params[4] and params[5] from 5.3 and 6 to something else. For example, increasing params[4] to 6 and decreasing params[5] to 5.3, or some other combination.

Alternatively, trying to vary the bias terms. In the best example, params[8] and [9] are both 6. Maybe lowering them to 5 or 5.7 to see if that affects the reward.

Another approach is to check which parameters are most frequently changed. For example, params[2] and params[6] are often negative, but maybe varying them could help. Let's think of a new set of parameters where some of the W elements are adjusted, and the biases are also modified.

For example, let's take the top params from the first example and adjust a few parameters. Let's say:

params[0] = 6 (same as before)
params[1] = 2.3 (trying a higher value)
params[2] = -6 (same)
params[3] = 6 (same)
params[4] = 6 (increasing from 5.3)
params[5] = 5.7 (lowering from 6)
params[6] = -6 (same)
params[7] = 6 (same)
params[8] = 5 (lowering from 6)
params[9] = 5 (lowering from 6)

This way, we're changing some parameters that were previously at 6 to lower values, and increasing params[1] to 2.3. This could potentially lead to a better reward by exploring different regions of the parameter space.
