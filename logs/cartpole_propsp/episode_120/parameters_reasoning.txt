SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to optimize the policy for the cartpole environment using a linear policy. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward f(params) given some parameters that are in the range of -6.0 to 6.0 with one decimal place. 

From what I understand, the current parameters set f(params) to around 326.60 based on the examples provided. However, the user mentioned that they're currently at iteration 120 out of 400 and want more exploration before moving too far into exploitation.

I remember that in reinforcement learning, one common approach is to balance between exploring new parameter values and exploiting the current best ones. Since the global optimum is around 500 reward points, it looks like we're currently below that but might need a bit more time (iterations) to reach that maximum reward.

The user's instruction says not to propose a parameter set that's been seen before, so I should choose different values for each parameter without repeating any. During exploration, I can adjust these parameters slightly—maybe changing one or two at a time in small increments. I should also ensure that the new parameter combinations aren't already used elsewhere.

I need to keep track of the top 8 best param sets and the most recent ones as mentioned in the examples provided. For each iteration, after evaluating f(params), I can include the best parameters so far along with the current one being tested to compare against.

Additionally, during exploration, it's important to maintain a reasonable step size for searching the parameter space—1.0 seems appropriate since we're dealing with continuous values. This allows me to move through the parameter space systematically without getting stuck in local minima or maxima.

I also need to be cautious about overexploitation. Even if I find some promising parameters, I should periodically switch back to more exploitation based on what's been working well so far. Maybe every 10 iterations or something like that.

Another thing to consider is whether the reward function is correctly implemented and whether there are any constraints on the action space. Since the action is linear with two actions (left or right), the policy's output directly maps to these actions, which I think I've accounted for in my parameter representation.

I should make sure not to propose parameter sets that have been used before, so maybe after each evaluation, I can note down the parameters and their corresponding reward if applicable. This way, I don't waste time suggesting the same set multiple times.

Also, when proposing new parameters, I need to ensure that they are within the specified range. Since 500 is achievable with parameters around [-2.4, -2.1], I should aim for parameter values close to that area in my next few iterations.

I wonder if there's a way to visualize how different parameter changes affect the reward. Maybe plotting each parameter's impact on f(params) could give me some insights into which parameters are most influential and where to focus my exploration efforts.

Additionally, considering the structure of the cartpole problem, I should make sure that the policy is correctly capturing the dynamics—maybe checking if the state transitions or rewards are implemented accurately based on the given reward function.

Another thought: perhaps using an optimization algorithm like gradient ascent could help speed up the convergence towards higher rewards. But since the parameters are continuous and we might not have a smooth gradient, I'm not sure how feasible that would be compared to more brute-force exploration with my current approach.

Given all these considerations, my strategy should involve systematically exploring parameter values around the current set, applying a controlled search step size (1.0), maintaining an open mind to different combinations without repeating seen ones, and periodically evaluating and updating based on the best rewards observed so far.
