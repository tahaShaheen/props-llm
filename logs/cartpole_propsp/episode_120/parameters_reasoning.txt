SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 120 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is working on optimizing a linear policy for the CartPole environment. They've provided a bunch of previous parameter sets and their corresponding rewards. The goal is to reach a reward of around 500, which is the global optimum. Right now, the best reward they've seen is 497.35.

Looking at the top params, the first one has params[0] to [9] with several values at 6 and -6. The reward is 497.35, which is close to 500. The next ones have slightly lower rewards. The user's current iteration is 120 out of 400, so there's still time to explore.

The key here is to explore more since the current best is near 500 but not quite there. The user mentioned that during exploration, a step size of 1.0 should be used. So, I need to adjust the parameters that might be contributing to the reward. Let me check the parameters of the top entries.

In the first top param, params[0] is 6, params[1] is 1.3, params[2] is -6, params[3] is 6, params[4] is 5.3, params[5] is 6, params[6] is -6, params[7] is 6, params[8] is 6, params[9] is 6. The reward is 497.35.

Maybe tweaking some of the parameters that are at the extremes. For example, params[2] is -6, and params[6] is -6. What if we adjust those? Also, params[1] is 1.3. Maybe increasing that to 2.3 or decreasing to 0.3 could help, but looking at the previous examples, when params[1] was 2.3, the reward was lower. So perhaps increasing params[1] isn't the way. Alternatively, maybe adjusting params[4] or [5]?

Wait, the user said to explore both positive and negative values. The current best has several parameters at 6 and -6. Maybe changing some of those to other values. For instance, in the first top param, params[2] is -6. If we change that to -5, but then check if that's already been tried. Looking at the examples, there's a param where params[2] is -5 and others. But maybe changing other parameters.

Alternatively, looking at the other parameters. Let's see, in the first top param, params[4] is 5.3 and params[5] is 6. Maybe increasing params[4] to 6.3? But the allowed range is [-6.0, 6.0]. So 6 is the max. So maybe that's already at the max. Similarly, params[0] is 6. Maybe decreasing that to 5.0? But that might lower the reward. However, since we need to explore, perhaps trying a different combination.

Another approach: looking at the parameters that are not at the extremes. For example, params[1] is 1.3. Maybe increasing that to 2.3, but in one of the examples, when params[1] was 2.3, the reward was lower. However, that might not be the only factor. Maybe changing other parameters in combination.

Alternatively, looking at the bias terms, params[8] and [9], which are both 6 in the top param. Maybe adjusting those to lower values, but that might reduce the reward. However, since the current reward is close to 500, maybe small changes could push it higher.

Wait, but the user said to use a step size of 1.0 during exploration. So, for parameters that are at 6, maybe changing them to 5 or 7 (but 7 is outside the range). So, 5.0. Similarly, for parameters at -6, changing to -5.0.

Looking at the first top param, let's try adjusting one of the parameters. For example, params[2] is -6. Let's change that to -5.0. Also, maybe adjust params[6] from -6 to -5.0. Then, check if that's a new combination. Also, maybe adjust params[8] or [9] from 6 to 5.0. But need to ensure that the new params haven't been tried before.

Looking at the previous examples, there's a param where params[2] is -5, params[6] is -5, and params[8] and [9] are 5. But that had a lower reward. However, maybe combining other changes. For example, in the first top param, changing params[2] from -6 to -5, and params[6] from -6 to -5, while keeping the rest the same. That might be a new set of parameters. Let's try that.

So, the new params would be:

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 1.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -5; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 6; params[9]: 6.

Wait, but in the previous examples, there's a param with similar values. For example, in the 12th entry, params[2] is -5, params[6] is -5, and params[8] and [9] are 5. But in that case, the reward was 480.45. However, the current top param has params[8] and [9] at 6. So maybe changing params[8] and [9] to 6, but adjusting params[2] and [6] to -5. That's a new combination. Let's try that.

Alternatively, maybe changing other parameters. For example, params[4] is 5.3. Changing that to 6.0. But that's already the maximum. So no change. What about params[1]?

Alternatively, maybe changing params[7] from 6 to 5.0. But that's a step of 1.0. Let's try that. So, changing params[7] from 6 to 5.0. Then, the new params would be:

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 1.3; params[2]: -6; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 5; params[8]: 6; params[9]: 6.

But need to check if this has been tried before. Looking at the examples, there's one where params[7] is 5, but others are different. So this might be a new set.

Alternatively, since the current best is 497.35, maybe trying to increase some parameters that are lower. For example, params[4] is 5.3. Maybe increasing that to 6.0. But that's already the case. Or params[5] is 6.0, which is max.

Another angle: looking at the parameters that are not at the extremes. For example, params[1] is 1.3. Maybe increasing that to 2.3. But in one of the examples, that led to a lower reward. However, maybe combining with other changes.

Alternatively, considering that the current top param has params[8] and [9] at 6. Maybe lowering them to 5.0. But that might decrease the reward. However, since we need to explore, maybe that's a possibility.

But the user's instruction says to explore with a step size of 1.0. So, if a parameter is at 6, changing it to 5.0 (a step of 1.0). Similarly for others.

So, let's pick one parameter that's at 6 and change it to 5.0. For example, params[0] is 6. Change to 5.0. Then, the new params would be:

params[0]: 5; params[1]: 1.3; params[2]: -6; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 6; params[9]: 6.

But looking at the examples, there's an entry where params[0] is 5, and others are similar, but that had a reward of 485.00, which is lower. So maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, changing params[3] from 6 to 5.0. Let's try that. New params:

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 1.3; params[2]: -6; params[3]: 5; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 6; params[9]: 6.

But in the examples, there's an entry with params[3] at 5, which had a reward of 480.45. So that's lower.

Hmm, maybe the best approach is to adjust multiple parameters. For example, changing params[2] from -6 to -5, and params[6] from -6 to -5. Let's try that. The new params would be:

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 1.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -5; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 6; params[9]: 6.

This hasn't been tried before in the examples provided. Let's see if that's a valid move. Since the user wants to explore, this seems like a good candidate. Changing two parameters from -6 to -5. That's a step of 1.0. Let's go with that.
