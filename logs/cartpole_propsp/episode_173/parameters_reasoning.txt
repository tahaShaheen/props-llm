SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 173 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to maximize the function f(params) for the cartpole environment. The goal is around 500, and I have to adjust the parameters of a linear policy. 

First, I see that the current params seem to be in the range of -6 to 6 with one decimal place. From the top params provided earlier, some are around -4.5 or lower, others are positive but not too high.

I need to propose new params values that might increase f(params). Since the goal is about 500, I should aim for higher rewards, which means keeping the pole upright and the cart within bounds as much as possible.

Looking at the top params, some have better performance. For example, params[8] being -2.5 and params[9] also around that range seems to be doing well. Maybe tweaking those could help. Also, one of them is 4.5 in another param set which was good too, so perhaps increasing a parameter there could also be beneficial.

I should try adjusting params[7], params[6], and params[8]. Let me pick some values between -3 to +4. Maybe something like params[7] = 2, params[6] = 0.5, params[8] = +1. I'm not sure if this will lead to a better reward because it's just a guess.

I'll try the new parameters and see how f(params) changes. If that doesn't surpass the top values, I might need to explore more or perhaps adjust other parameters. But starting with these adjustments seems like a good first step toward increasing the reward.
