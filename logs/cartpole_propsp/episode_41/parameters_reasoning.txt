SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 41 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has given me a bunch of training examples with different parameter values and their corresponding episodic rewards. My task is to find the optimal parameters that maximize the reward, aiming for around 500 as mentioned. 

Looking at the provided examples, the highest reward is 398.45 with params[0] at 6, params[1] at 0.3, and so on. But since the global optimum is supposed to be around 500, maybe there's a better combination that hasn't been tried yet.

The user mentioned that during exploration, a step size of 1.0 should be used. So, I need to consider varying the parameters by +/-1.0 from the current ones. However, I have to avoid repeating previously seen params. 

Looking at the existing params, some values are at the extremes like 6 or -6. Maybe adjusting some of the parameters that are at the edge could lead to better results. For example, params[2] is often -4 or -5. Maybe increasing that to -3 or even -2 could help? But I need to check if those values have been used before. 

Also, the bias terms (params[8] and params[9]) are mostly around 5 or 6. Maybe lowering them slightly could help balance the policy. However, the user said to explore both positive and negative values, so perhaps trying some lower values here.

Another thing to note is that the reward is increasing when certain parameters are adjusted. For instance, in the first example, params[0] is 6, which is the maximum allowed. Maybe keeping that high is good. But other parameters might need tweaking. 

I should look for parameters that haven't been explored much. For example, params[1] is mostly around 0.3 or 1.3. Maybe trying -0.7 or other values in that range. Also, params[3] is often 6, but sometimes 5.2 or 6.2. Maybe increasing it further to 6.3? Wait, no, the allowed range is up to 6.0. So maybe 6.0 is the max.

Wait, the parameters are in the range [-6.0, 6.0] with one decimal place. So, possible values are like -6.0, -5.9, ..., 5.9, 6.0. So, the step size of 1.0 during exploration would mean changing a parameter by +/-1.0. For example, if a parameter is at 6.0, adding 1.0 would go beyond the limit, so it's capped at 6.0. Similarly for -6.0.

Looking at the existing params, maybe some parameters could be adjusted. For instance, in the first example, params[8] and params[9] are both 6.0. Maybe reducing them to 5.0 or 4.0 could help. But I need to ensure that this hasn't been tried before. 

Alternatively, looking at the parameters that are lower, like params[6] which is -6.0 in many cases. Maybe increasing that to -5.0 or -4.0. But again, need to check if that's been done.

Another approach is to look for parameters that are in the middle of the range. For example, if a parameter is at 0.3, maybe trying 1.3 or -0.7 as done in some examples. But since the user said not to repeat previous params, I need to avoid those.

Wait, the user provided 20 examples. Let me check if there's a parameter that hasn't been explored much. For example, params[4] is often around 4.3, 5.3, or 6.0. Maybe trying 3.3 or 2.3? But again, need to check if those have been used. 

Alternatively, looking at the bias terms (params[8] and params[9]), they are mostly 5.3, 5.0, 6.0. Maybe trying 4.3 or lower. But again, need to avoid previous values.

Since the user mentioned that during exploration, a step size of 1.0 is used, perhaps I should take one of the existing high-performing params and perturb each parameter by +/-1.0. For example, take the first example with reward 398.45 and adjust some parameters.

In that example, params are [6, 0.3, -4, 6, 4.3, 1.7, -6, 6, 6, 6]. Let's consider changing params[2] from -4 to -3 (adding 1.0), params[4] from 4.3 to 5.3, and params[8] and params[9] from 6 to 5.0. That might lead to a better combination.

But I need to ensure that these new parameters haven't been tried before. Looking through the existing examples, I see that in some cases params[2] is -3, params[4] is 5.3, and params[8] and params[9] are 5.3. For example, one of the examples has params[2] at -3, params[4] at 5.3, and params[8] and params[9] at 5.3. But that example had a lower reward (352.65). So maybe adjusting other parameters could help.

Alternatively, maybe increasing params[5] from 1.7 to 2.7 (adding 1.0) and adjusting other parameters. But again, need to check if that's been done. 

Another thought: the highest reward so far is 398.45, which is close to 400 but not 500. The user says the global optimum is around 500, so there's room for improvement. Maybe the current exploration is stuck in a local optimum. To escape that, I should explore more aggressively, even if it means going into uncharted parameter regions.

For example, taking a parameter that's at 6.0 and reducing it to 5.0, or taking one at -6.0 and increasing it to -5.0. Also, trying some negative values for parameters that are currently positive. For instance, params[1] is 0.3, maybe trying -0.7 (as in some examples) but perhaps other values like -1.3 or -2.3.

But I need to make sure that the new parameters haven't been tried before. Looking through the examples, some negative values have been tried, but maybe not all combinations. 

Another approach is to look for parameters that are in the middle of their range and perturb them. For example, params[5] is 1.7 in some cases. Adding 1.0 gives 2.7, which has been tried in some examples. Maybe subtracting 1.0 to get 0.7, but that's also been tried. 

Alternatively, looking at params[7], which is 6.0 in many cases. Maybe reducing it to 5.0 or 4.0. 

This is a bit tricky. Since I can't repeat previous params, I need to find a combination that hasn't been used yet. Let me check the existing examples again to see what's been tried. 

Looking through the list, I see that params[0] is often 5 or 6. params[1] ranges from -0.7 to 1.3. params[2] ranges from -5 to -3. params[3] is mostly 6, but sometimes 5.2 or 6.2. params[4]맊
