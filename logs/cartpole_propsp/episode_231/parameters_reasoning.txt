SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to find the global optimal policy for this cartpole environment. The user mentioned that it's a 2D world with a pendulum on a cart, and the goal is to balance the pole. The state includes the cart position, velocity, pole angle, and angular velocity, all within specific ranges.

The policy is linear, using parameters W and B. I've been given some examples of parameter values and their corresponding rewards ( episodic reward f(params)). These examples show that the reward can range from around 397.95 to as high as 450.90 when certain parameters are set.

The user wants me to propose new parameters such that the reward is higher than any seen so far, aiming for at least a reward of 500. They also emphasized not to repeat any previous parameter sets and should explore both positive and negative values with a search step size of 1.0 during exploration.

Looking at the examples provided, I see multiple parameters set where some are around -6.0, others around +6.0 or in between. For instance, params[0] can be -6, -4.5, etc., and params[9] is consistently around -2.5 in many examples.

I also notice that the reward increases as params[8], which I believe is B[0], increases. So maybe adjusting some of these parameters in a way that boosts B might help. But considering it's a linear policy, changing any parameter affects all actions equally.

Wait, the user mentioned that during exploration, use search step size of 1.0. So perhaps starting from a known point and moving outwards incrementally. The current best is around -6 for some parameters, but I need to aim higher than that.

Maybe increasing params[8] (B[0]) would help because the reward seems to increase with higher values in other examples. Let me think of setting params[8] to +2.5 or something similar. What about params[7], which is 4.5? In some cases, it's set to 4.5 and the reward is around 397-450. If I can find a parameter combination where these are higher, perhaps that would boost the reward.

Alternatively, maybe adjusting params[6] or others could have a more significant effect on balancing. Let me look for parameters with values beyond -6.0 and +6.0 to see if any of them stand out as contributing to better rewards.

Wait, looking at the examples provided:

- When params[0] is -4.5 and params[2] is 1.8, the reward is around 397.95.
- When params[0] is -6, others are set such that it's a good reward of ~450.

So maybe increasing params[0], which is the cart position velocity parameter, could improve performance as the pole might not be balanced well if moving too fast. Alternatively, perhaps decreasing the cart velocity (making params[1] more negative) would help stabilize it, but I'm not sure how that affects the reward directly.

Another thought: since the user wants to explore both positive and negative values, maybe starting from a point around where some rewards are higher and then adjusting those parameters outward. For example, if params[0] is set to -4.5 in an example with a high reward, perhaps increasing it slightly could push the reward up.

Also, considering that the reward function gives +1 for every time step pole is upright and cart within bounds. So achieving stability is crucial. Any parameter change that increases this frequency would be beneficial.

I might also want to experiment with different combinations of parameters around the current top performers but trying out a few new ones in both positive and negative directions to see how they fare. Maybe focusing on parameters that have higher magnitudes could help achieve better balance, as seen in some examples where higher values for B[0] were beneficial.

I should also consider any other parameters like params[4], which is pole velocity. Lowering the pole's velocity (making it less negative) might stabilize the pole better during movement, thus increasing the reward when the pole doesn't fall over.

Putting this all together, I think starting from a point slightly higher than the current best and adjusting some of the parameters to see if that increases the reward. Maybe trying params[0] = -4.5, but pushing it down to -3.9 or something similar might help in balancing during pole movements.
