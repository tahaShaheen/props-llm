SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 8 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to find the optimal policy for the cartpole environment using reinforcement learning. The user has given some parameters and wants me to explore around 500 reward points, starting from a point where f(params) is about 28.6.

First, I remember that the policy is linear with 18 parameters. So, each action (left or right push) can be represented by multiplying these params with the state vector and adding them up. The action is determined by argmax(state @ W + B).

The reward function adds +1 every time step pole is upright (angle close to 0) and cart is within bounds (-2.4 to 2.4). The episode ends if pole flips or cart goes out of bounds.

Looking at the top performing params, one set is [6.6; 1.4; -1.8; -0.2; 3.7; 1.1; -1; 1.5; -2.1; -2.2], giving f=76.95. Another top param set is [-1.1; -2; 5.9; -0.3; 1.4; -1.4; -9.2; -3.1; -0.7; -1.3], with f=33.

The user's current params are [-4.8; 6.6; -1.5; 0.8; 3.7; 1.1; -1; 3.9; -0.7; 0.9] giving f=28.6, which is the highest in the recent example.

Since they want to explore around 500 points, I should choose params that are likely either near this top value or on the edge of being suboptimal. Maybe a step away from it and see if reward increases, then another step further, checking for better rewards.

I'll pick two sets: one slightly higher than current, giving f=31, and another lower to see if there's an improvement. This way, I can sample both near the top and explore the boundaries of the parameter space.
