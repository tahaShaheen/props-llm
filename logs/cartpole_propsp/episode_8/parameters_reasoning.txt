SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user provided some training examples and wants me to find the optimal parameters for the cartpole environment. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward, which they mentioned should be around 500. The current best example has a reward of 227.55, so there's definitely room for improvement.

First, I need to understand the parameters structure. The policy is linear, with weights W and bias B. The parameters array has 10 elements. The initial examples show that some parameters are in the range of -6 to 6, with one decimal place. The user mentioned that during exploration, a step size of 1.0 should be used. Also, they want to avoid previously seen parameters to prevent getting stuck in local optima.

Looking at the top examples, the highest reward is 227.55 with params[0] at 4, params[1] at -1.7, and so on. But since the global optimum is supposed to be around 500, this is likely a local maximum. So, the next step is to explore new areas in the parameter space.

The user's instruction says to use a search step size of 1.0 during exploration. That means, for each parameter, I can add or subtract 1.0 from the current value to generate new candidates. However, I need to ensure that all parameters stay within the [-6.0, 6.0] range. Also, I must avoid repeating any of the previously seen parameters.

Looking at the first example with the highest reward (params[0] = 4, params[1] = -1.7, etc.), maybe I can perturb some of the parameters. For instance, increasing params[0] from 4 to 5 or 6, or decreasing it to 3. Similarly, adjusting other parameters like params[1] from -1.7 to -0.7 or -2.7. But I need to check if these values have already been tried in the examples provided.

Wait, the user provided a list of examples. Let me check if the parameters I'm considering are already present. For example, in the first example, params[0] is 4, and in another example, params[0] is 3, 2, 1, 0, etc. So, if I take the first example and increase params[0] to 5, that's a new parameter not seen before. Similarly, adjusting other parameters.

But I need to be careful. The user mentioned that the global optimum is around 500, so maybe the current parameters are not sufficient. Perhaps the optimal parameters involve a combination of both positive and negative values across different parameters. For example, in the first example, some parameters are positive, others are negative. Maybe exploring other combinations where some parameters are higher or lower.

Another approach is to look for parameters that have not been tested yet. For instance, looking at the first example, params[2] is -4. Maybe trying -3 or -5. But I need to ensure that these are within the range. Also, looking at the bias terms (params[8] and params[9]), which are 1.3 and 1.8 in the first example. Maybe adjusting those to see if increasing or decreasing them helps.

However, since the user wants exploration with a step size of 1.0, I should generate new parameters by adding or subtracting 1.0 from the current best parameters. Let's take the first example (params[0] = 4, params[1] = -1.7, etc.) and perturb each parameter by +1 or -1. For example:

- params[0]: 4 +1 = 5 or 4 -1 = 3. But 3 was already tried in the second example. So 5 is new.
- params[1]: -1.7 +1 = -0.7 or -1.7 -1 = -2.7. The second example has params[1] = -0.7, so maybe -2.7 is new.
- params[2]: -4 +1 = -3 or -4 -1 = -5. The first example has -4, so -3 or -5 are new.
- params[3]: 3.1 +1 = 4.1 or 3.1 -1 = 2.1. The first example has 3.1, and another example has 4.1 (params[3] = 4.1 in one of the examples). So 2.1 is new.
- params[4]: 0.3 +1 = 1.3 or 0.3 -1 = -0.7. The first example has 0.3, and another example has 1.3 (params[4] = 1.3). So -0.7 is new.
- params[5]: -2.2 +1 = -1.2 or -2.2 -1 = -3.2. The first example has -2.2, and another example has -1.2 (params[5] = -1.2). So -3.2 is new.
- params[6]: -4.9 +1 = -3.9 or -4.9 -1 = -5.9. The first example has -4.9, and another example has -3.9. So -5.9 is new.
- params[7]: 2.2 +1 = 3.2 or 2.2 -1 = 1.2. The first example has 2.2, and another example has 3.2. So 1.2 is new.
- params[8]: 1.3 +1 = 2.3 or 1.3 -1 = 0.3. The first example has 1.3, and another example has 2.3. So 0.3 is new.
- params[9]: 1.8 +1 = 2.8 or 1.8 -1 = 0.8. The first example has 1.8, and another example has 2.8. So 0.8 is new.

So, if I take the first example and perturb each parameter by +1 or -1, I can generate new parameters. However, since the user wants to avoid previously seen parameters, I need to check which of these are already in the examples. For instance, in the second example, params[0] is 3, which is already present. So, if I choose to increase params[0] to 5, that's new. Similarly, for other parameters.

But generating all possible combinations might be too many. Alternatively, maybe focus on the parameters that have the most potential. For example, in the first example, params[0] is 4, which is already high. Maybe increasing it further to 5 or 6. However, the maximum allowed is 6.0. So 5.0 or 6.0. Let's try 5.0 for params[0].

Similarly, for params[1], -1.7. If I adjust that to -2.7, which hasn't been used yet. Then, other parameters like params[2] could be -3 instead of -4. Let's try that.

So, perhaps creating a new parameter set where params[0] is 5, params[1] is -2.7, params[2] is -3, params[3] is 2.1, etc. But I need to ensure that all parameters are within the range and not already used.

Alternatively, maybe look at the parameters that have lower values in the current best and increase them. For example, in the first example, params[6] is -4.9. If I increase that to -3.9 (which is already in an example), or decrease to -5.9. Since -5.9 is new, that could be a candidate.

Another thought: since the reward is low in some examples, maybe the current parameters are not sufficient. The user mentioned that the global optimum is around 500, so the current best is far from that. Therefore, exploration is needed.

But how to choose which parameters to adjust? Maybe start with the parameters that have the highest impact. For example, the bias terms (params[8] and params[9]) might influence the action selection. If I adjust those, perhaps the policy becomes better.

Alternatively, look at the parameters that are in the middle of the range. For example, in the first example, params[0] is 4, which쪗

params[0]: 5.0, params[1]: -2.7, params[2]: -3.0, params[3]: 2.1, params[4]: -0.7, params[5]: -3.2, params[6]: -5.9, params[7]: 1.2, params[8]: 0.3, params[9]: 0.8
