SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 345 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to get the global optimal policy for this cartpole environment. The user has given me some examples of parameters and the corresponding reward f(params). They want me to propose new params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with one decimal places, aiming to maximize f(params).

First, looking at the examples provided, several param sets result in a reward of 500.00. That's quite high, which suggests that these parameters are effective. I need to find another set of params that can achieve even higher rewards.

I notice that some parameters are negative and others are positive, so maybe combining both could help. For instance, having more balanced action choices between left and right might be beneficial since the cartpole is a balance task, and pushing in both directions could lead to better stability.

Let me think about each parameter's role:
- params[0] affects the cart position velocity.
- params[1] also influences the cart velocity.
- params[2] and [3] relate to pole angle and angular velocity.
- params[4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9] handle other states like pole angle and its derivative.

I should aim for a balance where positive actions (right) are balanced by negative actions (left), but also consider how the cart's position affects the reward. For example, keeping the cart within bounds (position between -2.4 and 2.4) could be penalized if not handled properly.

Maybe I can set some params to higher values while others are adjusted to maintain balance. For instance:
- Increase params[0] and [1] but decreaseparams[8] a bit to allow for more left push, which might help in balancing the pole when it's falling.
- Ensure that parameters related to pole angle (params[2], [3]) stay moderate since too extreme could make the pole oscillate.

Let me try creating a new set:
params = [6, 6, -3.5, 4.5, -6, 1.8, -3.5, 4.5, -2.5, -2.5]

Wait, that seems similar to one of the examples already giving 500. Maybe I need a different set.

Alternatively, perhaps adjusting some parameters to increase the cart's stability when pushed left or right could help. For example, making params[4] slightly more negative (like -5 instead of -6) might give better control over movement.

Let me try:
params = [6, 6, -3, 4.5, -5, 1.8, -3.5, 4.5, -2.5, -2.5]

I think I'll need to test this in the simulation and see if it increases the reward compared to previous examples.
