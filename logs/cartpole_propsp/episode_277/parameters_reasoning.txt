SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 277 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to optimize the parameters for a linear policy in the CartPole environment. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward, which they mentioned should be around 500. The current iteration is 277 out of 400, so there's still room for exploration.

Looking at the provided examples, the top-performing params have values like params[0] and params[1] around 6 and 2.3, params[2] around -5, params[3] at 6, and so on. The B terms (params[8] and params[9]) are mostly 5 or 6. However, some of the recent attempts have lower rewards, like when params[6] was changed to -5 or when params[7] was adjusted. 

The user's note says that if the current reward is below 500, they should explore instead of exploit. The examples given have some entries with 500.00, which is the target. But looking at the most recent params, some have lower rewards. For instance, the last entry had params[4] at 6, which might not be optimal. 

Since the current iteration is 277, and the maximum is 400, there's still time to explore. The exploration step size is 1.0, so I should consider making changes that deviate from the current best by 1.0 in some parameters. 

Looking at the params that have been tried, maybe tweaking some of the parameters that have been less explored. For example, params[2] is often -5, but maybe trying -6 or -4 could help. Similarly, params[6] has been at -6, but maybe changing it to -5 or -7 (though -7 is outside the range, so -5 or -6). 

Wait, the parameters must be within [-6.0, 6.0], so -6 is the minimum. So for params[2], trying -6 instead of -5. Also, looking at params[7], which was 6 in some cases and 5 in others. Maybe increasing it to 6 again. 

Another thing to check is the B terms. In some cases, params[8] and [9] are 5 or 6. Maybe increasing them further could help, but since they are already at 6 in some examples, perhaps adjusting them. 

But the user's instruction says to explore with a step size of 1.0. So if the current best has params[2] at -5, maybe trying -6 (a step of -1) or -4 (a step of +1). Similarly for other parameters. 

Looking at the top examples, the highest reward is 500.00 with params[0] at 6, params[1] at 2.3, params[2] at -5, params[3] at 6, params[4] at 5.3, params[5] at 6, params[6] at -6, params[7] at 6, params[8] at 5, params[9] at 5. 

But maybe changing params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3 (but wait, the range is up to 6.0). So 6.0 is the max. So maybe increasing params[4] to 6.0. Also, params[8] and [9] are 5 in some cases. Trying 6.0 there. 

Wait, in the first example, params[8] and [9] are 5, and that gives 500. But in another example, when params[8] and [9] are 6, the reward is lower. So maybe that's not the right direction. 

Alternatively, maybe adjusting some of the other parameters. For example, params[1] is 2.3. Trying 3.3 (adding 1.0) or 1.3 (subtracting 1.0). 

Another approach is to check which parameters have not been varied much. For instance, params[1] is mostly 2.3, but in one example it was 1.3. Maybe trying 3.3 could be a step. 

Also, looking at params[6], which was -6 in the best examples. Maybe changing it to -5 (a step of +1). 

But the user's instruction says that during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So I need to pick a parameter that's currently in the top examples and adjust it by +/-1.0. 

For example, take the first example with 500.00 and adjust params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3 (but 6.3 is beyond 6.0, so max is 6.0). So changing params[4] to 6.0. 

Alternatively, adjust params[2] from -5 to -6 (since -5 is the current value). 

Another possibility is to change params[7] from 6 to 5 (a step of -1). 

But since the user wants exploration, maybe trying different combinations. Let me think. 

If I take the top example and change one parameter by 1.0. Let's pick params[4] (currently 5.3). Increasing it to 6.3 is not allowed, so 6.0. So new params would be params[4] = 6.0. 

So the new params would be:

params[0]: 6.0, params[1]: 2.3, params[2]: -5.0, params[3]: 6.0, params[4]: 6.0, params[5]: 6.0, params[6]: -6.0, params[7]: 6.0, params[8]: 5.0, params[9]: 5.0. 

But wait, in one of the examples, params[4] was 6.0 and the reward was 465.15, which is lower. So maybe that's not a good move. 

Alternatively, adjust params[2] from -5 to -6. Let's try that. 

So params[2]: -6.0. Then other parameters remain the same. 

This would be:

params[0]: 6.0, params[1]: 2.3, params[2]: -6.0, params[3]: 6.0, params[4]: 5.3, params[5]: 6.0, params[6]: -6.0, params[7]: 6.0, params[8]: 5.0, params[9]: 5.0. 

This is a new set of parameters not seen before. 

Another possibility is adjusting params[8] or [9] from 5.0 to 6.0. Let's try that. 

params[8]: 6.0, others same. 

But in some examples, when params[8] was 6, the reward was lower. But maybe with other parameter changes, it could be better. 

Alternatively, adjust params[1] from 2.3 to 3.3 (adding 1.0). 

params[1]: 3.3. 

But I need to make sure that this hasn't been tried before. Looking at the examples, the first example has params[1] as 2.3, and another example has 1.3. So 3.3 is new. 

But the user said not to propose previously seen params. So if this is new, it's okay. 

However, the exploration step size is 1.0. So changing any parameter by +/-1.0 from the current best. 

Given that, maybe changing params[2] from -5 to -6. 

So the proposed params would be:

params[0]: 6.0, params[1]: 2.3, params[2]: -6.0, params[3]: 6.0, params[4]: 5.3, params[5]: 6.0, params[6]: -6.0, params[7]: 6.0, params[8]: 5.0, params[9]: 5.0. 

This is a new set of parameters, and it's an exploration step. 

Alternatively, changing params[7] from 6.0 to 5.0. 

But the user wants to explore, so trying different directions. 

Another approach: check which parameters have been varied. For example, params[6] was -6 in the best, but in another example, it was -5. Maybe changing it to -6 again. 

But that's already in the examples. So perhaps changing another parameter. 

Alternatively, adjusting params[5] from 6.0 to 5.0. 

But again, need to ensure it's not previously seen. 

Alternatively, adjusting params[3] from 6.0 to 5.0. 

But this is getting complicated. Maybe the best bet is to take the top example and adjust one parameter by 1.0, ensuring it's not previously seen. 

The first example has params[2] at -5.0. Changing that to -6.0 (a step of -1.0) would be a new parameter. 

So the new params would be:

params[0]: 6.0, params[1]: 2.3, params[2]: -6.0, params[3]: 6.0, params[4]: 5.3, params[5]: 6.0, params[6]: -6.0, params[7]: 6.0, params[8]: 5.0, params[9]: 5.0. 

This hasn't been seen in the examples provided, so it's a new exploration step. 

Alternatively, changing params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3 (but capped at 6.0). So 6.0. 

But that might not be as effective. 

Another possibility: changing params[8] or [9] from 5.0 to 6.0. 

Let's try that. 

params[8]: 6.0, others same. 

So:

params[0]: 6.0, params[1]: 2.3, params[2]: -5.0, params[3]: 6.0, params[4]: 5.3, params[5]: 6.0, params[6]: -6.0, params[7]: 6.0, params[8]: 6.0, params[9]: 5.0. 

But in the examples, there's a case where params[8] was 6.0 and params[9] was 6.0, but the reward was lower. However, maybe with other parameters adjusted, it could be better. 

But since the user wants exploration, even if it's a step that might not be optimal, it's necessary to try. 

So, between changing params[2] to -6 or params[8] to 6.0. Which is more likely to lead to a better reward? 

In the examples, when params[8] was 6.0 and params[9] was 5มหาวิทยาลัย, there was a case with 500.00. But in another case, when both were 6.0, the reward was lower. 

So maybe changing params[2] to -6 is a safer exploration step. 

Thus, the proposed parameters are as follows.
</think>

params[0]: 6.0, params[1]: 2.3, params[2]: -6.0, params[3]: 6.0, params[4]: 5.3, params[5]: 6.0, params[6]: -6.0, params[7]: 6.0, params[8]: 5.0, params[9]: 5.0
