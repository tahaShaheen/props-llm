SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of training examples where the episodic reward f(params) is 500.00 for many of them. But there's one example where f(params) is 456.70 and another with 234.60, etc. The goal is to find the global optimal policy, which the user mentioned should be around 500. However, some of the examples already hit 500.00, so maybe we're already in a local optimum. But the user said to explore instead of exploit if we're below 500, which suggests that maybe there's a way to get higher than 500.

Wait, the user mentioned that the global optimum should be around 500, but if we're below that, we should explore. However, the examples given already have several with 500.00. So maybe the current examples are already at the global optimum. But the user's instruction says to explore if below 500, but since some of the examples are at 500, perhaps we need to check if there's a way to go higher. However, the user also said that if we're below 500, it's a local optimum and we should explore. But since some of the examples are at 500, maybe the maximum is indeed 500, and the user wants to confirm that.

But looking at the examples, there's one with f(params): 456.70 and another with 234.60, which are lower than 500. So the user might be trying to find a better policy. However, the user also said that the global optimum should be around 500. So maybe the maximum is 500, and the examples with 500.00 are already optimal. But the user is asking to continue the search, perhaps to confirm that there's no higher value.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to get higher than 500 by adjusting the parameters. The user's instruction says to use a search step size of 1.0 during exploration. So perhaps we should explore by perturbing the parameters by ±1.0 from the current values. But the current examples have parameters like params[0] as 3.2, which is within the range [-6.0, 6.0]. So maybe trying to adjust some parameters by adding or subtracting 1.0 to see if we can get a higher reward.

Looking at the examples, the params that achieved 500.00 have a lot of variation in the parameters. For example, params[8] and params[9] (the bias terms) vary between 3.3, 4.3, 4.2, etc. Maybe adjusting those could help. Also, looking at the W matrix parameters. For instance, params[6] is -4.9, -5.9, -6.0, etc. Maybe trying to change params[6] to -3.9 (which is in the range) could lead to a better result. However, in the examples, changing params[6] to -3.9 resulted in 500.00 as well. So maybe that's not the way.

Alternatively, looking at the action selection. The policy is argmax(state @ W + B). So the weights and biases determine which action is chosen. To maximize the reward, the policy needs to balance the pole effectively. The current examples have certain parameters that achieve 500, but perhaps tweaking some of the parameters that are on the edge of the range could help. For example, params[6] is at -6.0 in one example. Maybe increasing it by 1.0 to -5.0? But the user said during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So if we take a parameter that's at -6.0 and add 1.0, it becomes -5.0. But in the examples, when params[6] was -6.0, the reward was 500.00. So maybe that's already optimal.

Alternatively, looking at other parameters. For example, params[4] is -2.4 in many examples. If we adjust that to -3.4 or -1.4, but in the examples, when params[4] was -3.4, the reward was 500.00 as well. So perhaps that's not the issue.

Wait, the user mentioned that the global optimum should be around 500. So if the current examples have 500.00, then maybe that's the maximum. However, the user might be expecting us to find a higher value. But according to the problem statement, the reward is +1 for every time step, and the maximum episode length is 200 (since the original CartPole has a maximum of 200 steps, but the user's MAX_STEPS is 400). Wait, maybe the user's environment has a different maximum steps. However, in the examples, the reward is 500.00, which could imply that the episode lasted 500 steps. But the original CartPole problem has a maximum of 200 steps, so maybe the user's environment is different. But that's aside.

Given that the current examples already have 500.00, perhaps the optimal is indeed 500, and the user is just testing to see if we can find that. However, the user's instruction says that if we're below 500, we should explore. Since some examples are at 500, maybe the answer is to stick with those parameters. But the user wants us to provide a new set of parameters that haven't been used before.

Looking at the examples, the first example has params[8]: 3.3 and params[9]: 4.2. In another example, params[8] is 4.3 and params[9] is 4.2. Maybe changing params[8] to 5.3 or 2.3, and see. But since the user said not to propose previously seen params, we need to find new ones.

Alternatively, maybe adjusting some other parameters. For example, in the examples, params[0] is 3.2, params[1] is 4.3, etc. Let's look for parameters that haven't been tried yet. For example, in the examples, params[0] has been 3.2, 2.2, 4.2. Maybe trying 1.2 or 5.2. But since the step size is 1.0 during exploration, we can try adding or subtracting 1.0 from existing parameters.

For example, take the first example where params[0] is 3.2. Adding 1.0 gives 4.2, which was tried in another example. Subtracting 1.0 gives 2.2, which was also tried. So maybe that's not helpful. How about params[1] in the first example is 4.3. Adding 1.0 gives 5.3, which hasn't been tried. Maybe trying that.

Alternatively, looking at params[5], which in some examples is 1.9. Adding 1.0 gives 2.9, which was tried in one example (params[5]: 2.9). So that's already tried. Maybe subtracting 1.0 to get 0.9, which was in another example (params[5]: 0.9).

Hmm. This is tricky. The user wants us to not propose previously seen params. So we need to find parameters that are different from all the examples provided.

Looking through the examples, perhaps adjusting params[7]. In the examples, params[7] is -0.1, -1.1, 0.9. So maybe trying params[7] as 1.9 or -2.1. But the step size is 1.0, so if the current value is -0.1, adding 1.0 gives 0.9 (which was tried), subtracting 1.0 gives -1.1 (also tried). So maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, looking at params[2], which in some examples is 1.3, 2.3, 0.3. So trying 3.3 or -0.7. But the step size is 1.0, so if current is 1.3, adding 1.0 gives 2.3 (tried), subtracting gives 0.3 (tried). So that's not helpful.

What about params[4], which in some examples is -2.4, -3.4, -1.4. Trying -4.4 or 0.6. But the step size is 1.0. If current is -2.4, adding 1.0 gives -1.4 (tried), subtracting gives -3.4 (tried). So again, already tried.

Hmm. Maybe looking at the bias terms. params[8] and params[9] in the examples are 3.3, 4.3, 3.2, 5.2. So trying 2.3, 5.3, 6.0, -0.0, etc. For example, params[8] could be 6.0, which hasn't been tried. Similarly, params[9] could be 6.0.

But the user said that during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So if the current value is 4.2 (as in some examples), adding 1.0 gives 5.2 (tried), subtracting gives 3.2 (tried). But maybe trying to add 1.0 to 5.2 to get 6.2, but that's outside the range [-6.0, 6.0]. Wait, the parameters are in the range [-6.0, 6.0], so 6.0 is the upper bound. So if the current value is 5.2, adding 1.0 would be 6.2, which is out of range. So we can't do that. So maybe trying 6.0 as the maximum.

So perhaps changing params[9] from 4.2 to 5.2 (which was tried in one example) or 6.0. But 5.2 was tried, so trying 6.0. Let's see.

Another idea: looking at the examples, many have params[6] as -4.9, -5.9, -6.0, -3.9, etc. Maybe trying params[6] as -2.9 (adding 1.0 to -3.9). But that hasn't been tried in the examples. Wait, in the examples, when params[6] was -3.9, the reward was 500.00. So maybe that's okay.

Alternatively, trying to adjust other parameters. For example, params[7] in some examples is -0.1, and if we add 1.0, it becomes 0.9 (tried), subtract 1.0 to get -1.1 (tried). So no new options there.

This is challenging. Since the user wants us to not repeat previous parameters, but all the parameters in the examples are already at the maximum of 500.00, maybe we need to find a new combination that hasn't been tried yet. For example, changing multiple parameters at once.

Looking at the examples, the first example has params[0] to [9] as 3.2, 4.3, 1.3, 4.6, -2.4, 1.9, -4.9, -0.1, 3.3, 4.2. Let's see if we can change one parameter by 1.0 to get a new combination.

For example, changing params[0] from 3.2 to 4.2 (which was tried in one example, giving 234.60). But that's lower. Not helpful. How about changing params[1] from 4.3 to 5.3 (not tried yet). So new params would be 3.2, 5.3, 1.3, 4.6, -2.4, 1.9, -4.9, -0.1, 3.3, 4.2. That's a new combination. Maybe that's worth trying.

Alternatively, changing params[2] from 1.3 to 2.3 (which was tried in one example, giving 500.00). So that's already tried. Not helpful.

How about changing params[3] from 4.6 to 5.6 (which was tried in one example, giving 500.00). So that's already tried. Not helpful.

What about params[4] from -2.4 to -1.4 (which was tried in one example, giving 500.00). So that's already tried.

params[5] from 1.9 to 2.9 (which was tried in one example, giving 500.00). So that's already tried.

params[6] from -4.9 to -3.9 (which was tried in one example, giving 500.00). So that's already tried.

params[7] from -0.1 to 0.9 (which was tried in one example, giving 500.00). So that's already tried.

params[8] from 3.3 to 4.3 (which was tried in one example, giving 500.00). So that's already tried.

params[9] from 4.2 to 5.2 (which was tried in one example, giving 456.70). So that's lower. Not helpful.

Hmm. Maybe changing multiple parameters. For example, changing params[8] from 3.3 to 4.3 and params[9] from 4.2 to 5.2. But that's already tried in one example (params[8]: 4.3, params[9]: 5.2, f(params): 456.70). Not helpful.

Alternatively, changing params[0] from 3.2 to 2.2 (tried, giving 224.45). Not helpful.

This is really tough. All the single parameter changes that are within 1.0 step size from the existing examples have already been tried, and most give 500.00 or lower. So maybe the current examples are already at the global optimum, and any further exploration would not yield higher rewards. But the user said that the global optimum should be around 500, which the examples have already achieved. Therefore, perhaps the answer is to stick with one of the existing parameters that gives 500.00, but the user said not to propose previously seen params. So this is a problem.

Wait, the user's instruction says "Do not propose previously seen params." So even if the existing parameters give 500.00, we can't use them again. So we need to find new parameters that haven't been tried yet, even if they might give the same or lower reward.

But how? The examples have covered many variations. Maybe trying to change two parameters at once. For example, take the first example and change two parameters by 1.0. For instance, increase params[0] by 1.0 (to 4.2) and decrease params[1] by 1.0 (to 3.3). That gives a new set of parameters. Let's see: params[0]: 4.2, params[1]: 3.3, others same. But in the examples, there was one where params[0] was 4.2 and params[1] was 3.3, which gave f(params): 234.60. So that's lower. Not helpful.

Alternatively, increase params[8] and params[9] by 1.0. For example, params[8]: 3.3 + 1.0 = 4.3, params[9]: 4.2 + 1.0 = 5.2. But that's already tried, giving 456.70.

Alternatively, decrease params[8] and params[9] by 1.0. params[8]: 3.3 -1.0 = 2.3, params[9]: 4.2 -1.0 = 3.2. That's a new combination. Let's check if that's been tried. Looking at the examples, there was one with params[8]: 3.3 and params[9]: 3.2. Yes, in the example where params[8]: 3.3 and params[9]: 3.2, f(params) was 500.00. So that's already tried.

This is really challenging. It seems like all possible parameter changes within the step size of 1.0 from the existing examples have already been tried, and most give 500.00 or lower. Therefore, maybe the only way to proceed is to randomly perturb some parameters by 1.0, even if it's not sure. For example, changing params[6] from -4.9 to -5.9 (which was tried, giving 500.00). Not helpful.

Wait, maybe changing params[6] from -4.9 to -6.0 (already tried) or -3.9 (already tried). No new options there.

Another idea: looking at the parameters that are not in the examples. For example, in the examples, params[4] is -2.4, -3.4, -1.4. What about params[4] = -4.4? That's within the range. Let's try that. So changing params[4] from -2.4 to -3.4 (already tried), then to -4.4. That's a new parameter. Let's try that.

So, for example, take the first example and change params[4] to -4.4. The new params would be:

params[0]: 3.2, params[1]: 4.3, params[2]: 1.3, params[3]: 4.6, params[4]: -4.4, params[5]: 1.9, params[6]: -4.9, params[7]: -0.1, params[8]: 3.3, params[9]: 4.2.

This is a new combination not seen before. Let's propose this.
</think>

params[0]: 3.2; params[1]: 4.3; params[2]: 1.3; params[3]: 4.6; params[4]: -4.4; params[5]: 1.9; params[6]: -4.9; params[7]: -0.1; params[8]: 3.3; params[9]: 4.2
