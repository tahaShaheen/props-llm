SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to optimize the parameters for a linear policy in the CartPole environment. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward, which they mentioned should be around 500. The current examples provided have rewards up to 413.65, which is below the target. So, the user needs to explore more to find the global optimum.

Looking at the examples, some patterns emerge. For instance, params[0], [1], [3], [7], [8], and [9] often have high values like 6, 5.3, 6, 5, 5, etc. Others like [2] and [6] are negative, sometimes -6. Maybe these parameters are involved in balancing the cart and pole. The action is determined by the maximum of state @ W + B, so the weights W and biases B need to be tuned so that the correct action is chosen based on the state.

The user's current iteration is 43 out of 400, so there's a lot of room for exploration. Since the global optimum is around 500, and the current best is 413, we need to look for parameters that might push the reward higher. The advice was to use a search step size of 1.0 during exploration, so maybe perturbing existing parameters by +/-1.0 in some directions.

Looking at the top examples, the highest reward was 413.65 with params[0]=6, [1]=1.3, [2]=-3, [3]=6, [4]=5.3, [5]=2.7, [6]=-6, [7]=6, [8]=5, [9]=5. Maybe increasing some of the positive parameters or adjusting the negative ones. For example, increasing [4] from 5.3 to 6.3, but wait, the parameters are limited to [-6.0, 6.0], so 6 is the max. So maybe [4] is already at 5.3, which is under 6. Perhaps increasing [1] from 1.3 to 2.3? Or adjusting [2] from -3 to -4? But in previous examples, when [2] was -4, the reward was lower. Hmm.

Alternatively, looking at other parameters. The current example with params[0]=6, [1]=0.3, [2]=-4, [3]=6, [4]=5.3, [5]=2.7, [6]=-6, [7]=6, [8]=6, [9]=6 had a reward of 398.45. So maybe increasing [8] and [9] from 6 to 6 (already max) but maybe adjusting other parameters. Wait, but the user said not to propose previously seen params. So need to find new ones.

Another approach: since the current best is 413.65, maybe trying to tweak parameters that are close to that. For example, in that top example, [0]=6, [1]=1.3, [2]=-3, [3]=6, [4]=5.3, [5]=2.7, [6]=-6, [7]=6, [8]=5, [9]=5. Maybe increasing [8] and [9] from 5 to 6, but that's already in some examples. However, the user says not to repeat previous params. So perhaps changing other parameters. For example, increasing [5] from 2.7 to 3.7? Or [4] from 5.3 to 6.0? Let's check the constraints: parameters are in [-6.0, 6.0] with one decimal place. So [4] can be 6.0. Let's try that. So changing [4] to 6.0, and maybe adjusting other parameters. But need to ensure that the new params haven't been used before.

Alternatively, looking at other examples where some parameters are different. For instance, in one example, [3] was 6.2, but the allowed range is up to 6.0. So that's invalid. Wait, the user said the params are in [-6.0, 6.0], so any values beyond that are not allowed. So in the examples, some had 6.2, but maybe that's a typo? Or maybe the user made a mistake. But according to the problem statement, the params are in [-6.0, 6.0], so we need to stay within that range.

So, considering that, perhaps adjusting [3] from 6 to 6 (already max). Maybe trying to increase [7] from 6 to 6 (already max). So perhaps looking for other parameters. For example, in the top example, [8] and [9] are 5. Maybe increasing them to 6. But that was tried in some examples. However, the user says not to repeat previous params. So need to check if that combination has been used before. For example, in one of the examples, params[8] and [9] were 6, but other parameters were different. So maybe changing some other parameters while keeping [8] and [9] at 6.

Alternatively, looking at parameters that are lower in the examples. For instance, in one example, [2] was -5, but that led to lower rewards. However, maybe there's a sweet spot. Let's think about the policy function. The action is the argmax of state @ W + B. So each element of W is multiplied by the state variables. For example, W[0][0] and W[0][1] would be multiplied by cart_position and cart_velocity. So maybe the weights for the cart's position and velocity need to be tuned to push the cart in the right direction when it's moving away from the center.

But this is getting complicated. Since the user wants exploration with step size 1.0, maybe take the best current example (params that gave 413.65) and perturb some parameters by +/-1.0. Let's take that example:

params[0] = 6, [1] = 1.3, [2] = -3, [3] = 6, [4] = 5.3, [5] = 2.7, [6] = -6, [7] = 6, [8] = 5, [9] = 5.

Now, let's try increasing [8] and [9] to 6 (since they are currently 5). That would be a step of +1.0. But in previous examples, when [8] and [9] were 6, the reward was lower. However, maybe in combination with other parameter changes. Alternatively, maybe changing [2] from -3 to -4 (step of -1.0). But in previous examples, that led to lower rewards. Alternatively, changing [4] from 5.3 to 6.3, but that's over the limit. So 6.0 is the max. So changing [4] to 6.0. Let's try that. So new params would be:

params[0] = 6, [1] = 1.3, [2] = -3, [3] = 6, [4] = 6.0, [5] = 2.7, [6] = -6, [7] = 6, [8] = 5, [9] = 5. But wait, this changes [4] from 5.3 to 6.0. Let's check if that's allowed. Yes, since 6.0 is within the range. Then, maybe also increase [8] and [9] to 6.0. So:

params[0] = 6, [1] = 1.3, [2] = -3, [3] = 6, [4] = 6.0, [5] = 2.7, [6] = -6, [7] = 6, [8] = 6, [9] = 6. But this combination might have been tried before. Let me check the examples. Looking through the list, there's an example with params[4]=5.3, [8]=6, [9]=6. But in that case, [4] was 5.3. So changing [4] to 6.0 and [8], [9] to 6.0 might be a new combination. Let's try that. However, the user said not to repeat previous params. If this combination hasn't been used before, it's okay.

Alternatively, maybe perturbing other parameters. For example, increasing [1] from 1.3 to 2.3. Let's try that. So:

params[0] = 6, [1] = 2.3, [2] = -3, [3] = 6, [4] = 5.3, [5] = 2.7, [6] = -6, [7] = 6, [8] = 5, [9] = 5. This is a new combination. Maybe this could lead to higher rewards.

Another idea: looking at parameters that are lower in the current top example. For example, [5] is 2.7. Maybe increasing that to 3.7? Let's see. But need to check if that's within the range. Yes, 3.7 is allowed. So changing [5] from 2.7 to 3.7. But again, need to ensure this hasn't been tried before.

Alternatively, looking at other parameters. Maybe [2] is -3. What if we change that to -4? Let's try that. But in previous examples, changing [2] to -4 led to lower rewards. However, maybe in combination with other changes.

This is a bit trial and error, but given the time constraints, perhaps trying a few variations of the current top example with step size 1.0. Let's go with increasing [4] to 6.0 and [8], [9] to 6.0. So:

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 1.3, params[2]: -3, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 6.0, params[5]: 2.7, params[6]: -6, params[7]: 6, params[8]: 6, params[9]: 6.

Alternatively, maybe changing [1] from 1.3 to 2.3 and keeping others the same. But need to check if that's a new combination. Since the user hasn't provided that in the examples, it's safe to try.

Another approach: looking for parameters that were previously low but could be increased. For example, in the top example, [8] and [9] are 5. Maybe increasing them to 6. So:

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 1.3, params[2]: -3, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 5.3, params[5]: 2.7, params[6]: -6, params[7]: 6, params[8]: 6, params[9]: 6.

This is a new combination. Let's go with this. The user said not to repeat previous params. In the examples, there was one with params[8] and [9] at 6, but other parameters were different. So this could be a valid new attempt.
