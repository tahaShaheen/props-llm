SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to optimize the parameters for a linear policy in the CartPole environment. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward, which they mention should be around 500. The current examples provided have rewards up to 492, so there's some room for improvement.

Looking at the top examples, the highest reward is 492.00 with params that have several 6s and some negative values. For instance, params[0] is 6, params[1] is 1.3, params[2] is -6, and so on. The pattern seems to be that some weights are high positive, others are high negative, and the biases are also high positive. 

But the user mentioned that if the reward is below 500, it's a local optimum and they need to explore more. The current best is 492, which is close to 500 but not there yet. So maybe the next step is to explore variations around the current best parameters, adjusting some of the values by the suggested step size of 1.0. 

Looking at the parameters, maybe some of the values that are at the extremes (like -6 or 6) could be adjusted. For example, in the top example, params[2] is -6, params[3] is 6, params[6] is -6, and params[7] is 6. Perhaps adjusting these to different values might help. Also, the biases (params[8] and params[9]) are both 6 in the highest reward example. Maybe tweaking those could lead to better results.

Another thing to note is that in some examples, changing params[1] from 1.3 to 2.3 led to a lower reward (341.05), so that's not helpful. But maybe other parameters can be adjusted. For instance, in the current top example, params[4] is 4.3 and params[5] is 4.7. If those are increased to 5.3 or 5.7, maybe that would help. But looking at other examples, when params[4] and [5] were 5.3 and 5.7, the reward was 491.70, which is slightly lower than 492. So maybe that's not the right direction.

Alternatively, maybe some of the parameters that are currently at -6 or 6 could be adjusted to -5 or 5. For example, in the top example, params[2] is -6. If that's changed to -5, maybe that could lead to a better reward. But in one of the examples, when params[2] was -5, the reward was 486.85, which is lower than 492. So that might not be the case.

Wait, but the user mentioned that during exploration, the step size should be 1.0. So perhaps we need to take a step from the current best parameters. Let's take the top example: params[0]:6, params[1]:1.3, params[2]:-6, params[3]:6, params[4]:4.3, params[5]:4.7, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:6, params[9]:6. If we adjust some of these by 1.0, maybe in the negative or positive direction.

For instance, let's try increasing params[4] from 4.3 to 5.3 (adding 1.0) and see. But in an example where params[4] was 5.3 and params[5] was 5.7, the reward was 491.70, which is slightly lower. Maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, decreasing params[4] to 3.3? But that might not be as effective.

Alternatively, maybe adjusting the biases. The current top example has params[8] and [9] as 6. If we lower them to 5, but that might reduce the reward. However, in some examples, when the biases were 5, the reward was lower. So that might not be the way.

Another approach is to look for parameters that are not at the extremes. For example, params[1] is 1.3. If we increase it to 2.3, but that led to a lower reward. However, maybe adjusting other parameters that are not at the extremes. For example, params[4] and [5] are 4.3 and 4.7. Maybe increasing them to 5.3 and 5.7, but that was tried and resulted in slightly lower reward. Hmm.

Alternatively, looking at other parameters. For instance, params[6] is -6. If we change that to -5, but in an example where params[6] was -5, the reward was lower. So perhaps that's not helpful.

Wait, the user said to explore both positive and negative values. Maybe there's a parameter that's currently at a high value but could be adjusted. For example, params[3] is 6. If we lower it to 5, but that might not help. Alternatively, maybe adjusting params[2] from -6 to -7? But the range is limited to [-6.0, 6.0], so that's not possible.

Hmm, perhaps the best approach is to take the current top parameters and make small adjustments. For example, in the top example, params[4] is 4.3. If we increase that by 1.0 to 5.3, and params[5] to 5.7 (as in one of the examples), but that gave 491.70. However, maybe combining that with other changes. For instance, if we also adjust params[8] and [9] from 6 to 5, but that might lower the reward.

Alternatively, maybe adjusting some other parameters. For example, params[7] is 6. If we lower that to 5, but that might not help. Alternatively, looking at params[0] which is 6. Maybe decreasing it to 5, but in an example where params[0] was 5, the reward was lower. So that might not be helpful.

Wait, maybe the current best is already near the optimal, and the next step is to explore other regions. For instance, changing some parameters that are currently at 6 to 5, but also changing others. Let me think: if I take the top parameters and decrease params[0] from 6 to 5, and increase params[2] from -6 to -5. That would be a step in both directions. But in one of the examples, when params[0] was 5 and params[2] was -5, the reward was 485.00, which is lower than 492. So that might not help.

Alternatively, maybe adjusting some of the parameters that are not at the extremes. For example, params[1] is 1.3. If we increase that to 2.3, but that led to lower rewards. However, maybe adjusting other parameters that are at 1.3. But I don't see any other parameters with that value.

Alternatively, looking for parameters that are not in the top examples. For example, maybe adjusting params[6] from -6 to -5 and params[7] from 6 to 5. But that might not help. 

Hmm, this is tricky. The user wants to explore more to reach the global optimum around 500. The current best is 492, so there's a gap. Maybe trying to adjust some parameters that are not in the current top examples. For example, looking at the example where params[4] was 6 and params[5] was 6, but that had a lower reward. However, maybe combining that with other changes.

Alternatively, trying to increase some parameters that are currently lower. For example, in the top example, params[4] is 4.3. If we increase that to 5.3, and params[5] to 5.7, but that was tried and gave 491.70. However, maybe adjusting other parameters as well. For instance, if we also increase params[8] and [9] from 6 to 6 (they are already at maximum). So that's not possible.

Wait, maybe the current best is already at the maximum for some parameters. For example, params[0], [3], [7], [8], [9] are all at 6. So there's no way to increase them further. The only way is to decrease them or adjust others. Maybe decreasing some of the high positive values and increasing some of the negative ones. For example, in the current top example, params[2] is -6 and params[6] is -6. If we increase those to -5, but that might lower the reward.耳边
