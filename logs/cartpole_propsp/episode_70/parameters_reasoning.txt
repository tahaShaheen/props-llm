SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:

Now you are at iteration 70 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is working on optimizing a linear policy for the CartPole environment. They've provided a bunch of training examples with different parameter values and their corresponding episodic rewards. The goal is to find the global optimum, which they mention should be around 500. The current iteration is 70 out of 400, so there's still a lot of room for exploration.

Looking at the examples given, the highest reward so far is 430.60. But the user says the global optimum is around 500, so we need to explore more. The key here is to avoid getting stuck in local optima. The instructions mention that during exploration, a search step size of 1.0 should be used. That means making significant changes to the parameters to explore the space more broadly.

The parameters are in the range [-6.0, 6.0] with one decimal place. The previous examples have a lot of parameters set to 6 or -6, especially in W and B. For instance, params[0], [1], [3], [6], [7], [8], [9] are often at extremes. Maybe the current parameters are too focused on those extremes, and we need to try varying some of them more.

Looking at the parameters in the highest reward example (430.60), the W matrix has some high values, but maybe there's a better combination. For example, params[4] and [5] are 5.3 and 3.7. Perhaps adjusting those could help. Also, the bias terms (params[8] and [9]) are both 6. Maybe reducing them slightly could lead to better performance.

Since the user mentioned that exploration is needed, I should consider changing some parameters by +/-1.0 from their current values. Let's look at the parameters that are at the extremes. For example, params[0] is 6.0. Maybe reducing that to 5.0 could help. Similarly, params[2] is -3.0. Changing that to -4.0 or -2.0 might explore new areas.

Another thing to note is that the previous examples have some parameters that are not at the extremes. For instance, params[1] is 1.3 in some cases, which is not the maximum. Maybe increasing or decreasing that could lead to better results. Also, params[5] is sometimes 2.7 or 3.7. Trying 1.7 or 4.7 might be worth exploring.

I need to ensure that the new parameters are not the same as previously seen. The user emphasized not to propose previously seen params. So, I should check against the examples provided. For example, in the first example, params[0] is 6, params[1] is 1.3, etc. So, if I change some of these, I can avoid repetition.

Let me think of a set of parameters that deviates from the current high-performing ones. For example, take the highest reward example (params[0] to [9] as 6, 1.3, -3, 6, 5.3, 3.7, -6, 6, 6, 6). To explore, maybe decrease params[0] to 5.0, increase params[2] to -2.0, and adjust params[4] to 6.0. Also, lower the bias terms slightly. Let's try:

params[0]: 5.0
params[1]: 0.3 (since in one example it was 0.3)
params[2]: -4.0 (changing from -3)
params[3]: 5.0 (instead of 6)
params[4]: 6.0 (instead of 5.3)
params[5]: 1.7 (lower than 3.7)
params[6]: -5.0 (instead of -6)
params[7]: 5.0 (instead of 6)
params[8]: 5.0 (lower than 6)
params[9]: 5.0 (same as above)

This set changes several parameters from their previous values, using a step size of 1.0 where necessary, and avoids repeating the exact same parameters as before. This should help in exploring new regions of the parameter space, potentially leading to higher rewards.
