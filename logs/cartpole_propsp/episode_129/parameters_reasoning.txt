SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 129 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.

<think>
Okay, so I need to help this person find the global optimal policy for the cartpole environment using some training examples they've provided. The cartpole is a classic RL problem where balancing a pole on a cart is the goal. 

From what I understand, the user has set up an interaction where they provide parameters and get feedback on how good the reward was. They want me to propose parameters that maximize this reward function f(params). They've given some examples with specific params values and corresponding rewards.

The initial parameter setup uses 10 decimal places in [-6.0, 6.0]. The user wants to explore both positive and negative values, using a step size of 1.0 for exploration. Since the global optimum is around 500 reward points, they're looking for better than that.

Looking at their examples, some params have high rewards (like around 340) while others are lower. I need to find parameters in the range where f(params) is higher than what they've currently seen. 

I remember that when using gradient ascent methods like policy gradients or Q-learning, it's crucial to choose appropriate initial values because they might get stuck in local optima if not properly initialized. So maybe starting with a slightly positive value for params[0] could help.

Also, the reward is 1 added every time the pole stays upright and the cart is within bounds. It doesn't penalize for being too far or unstable. So, balancing these factors might be key. The negative params probably represent something to counteract over-acting (like pushing left when it's not needed), but I need to see if those parameters can contribute positively.

I think starting with small positive values around zero could help avoid getting stuck in local optima and give a better chance of finding the global optimum. So maybe setting all params[0] through [9] to 2.5 or similar, as that's within the given range and provides a reasonable balance.

params[0]: 2.5, params[1]: 2.5, params[2]: 2.5, params[3]: 2.5, params[4]: 2.5, params[5]: 2.5, params[6]: 2.5, params[7]: 2.5, params[8]: 2.5, params[9]: 2.5
