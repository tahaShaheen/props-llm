SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 237 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to find the global optimal policy for the cartpole environment using this linear policy approach. The goal is to balance the pole and keep the cart within its bounds. 

The user provided a bunch of params values that resulted in a certain reward (f(params)). They want me to propose new params values that might result in a higher f(params) as much as possible, but without going below 500 because they're just looking for a local optimum. The parameters are W and B from the policy action = argmax(state @ W + B), where state is [cart_pos, cart_v, pole_ang, pole_v]. 

Looking at the current top performing params, like one with f=493.90, it seems like increasing some of the middle or higher parameters might help. For example, raising params[0] and params[1], which are the cart position and velocity, could improve the pole balance. Also, maybe adjusting other parameters around 0 or positive numbers could have a significant impact.

I think I should aim for higher values in the first few parameters to give more weight to the current state components that affect the pole's stability. Maybe increasing some middle params like [3] and [5], but also considering others. It's about maximizing the reward without overstepping, so balancing between pushing right and left as much as possible might be key.

I'll try setting a few higher values in [0], [1], maybe [2], and see if that boosts f(params) up from 493 to around 500 or more. Also, perhaps increasing other params slightly while keeping others balanced could give a better score without going too high.
