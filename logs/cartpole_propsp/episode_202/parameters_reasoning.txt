SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to find the global optimal policy for this cartpole environment using a linear policy. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward f(params). Let me think through how I can approach this.

First, I need to understand the setup. The state space is quite large: four elements with specific ranges. The actions are two options, pushing left or right. The reward function rewards being upright and within bounds for each time step. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

I have parameters W and B that define the linear policy. Each action is determined by a dot product of the state with W plus B, then taking the argmax. My goal is to find the best params array that maximizes f(params).

Looking at the provided examples, I see several different parameter sets and their corresponding rewards. For instance:

- One set has a reward of 450.90.
- Another has 437.80.
- And so on.

These examples suggest that higher reward values correspond to better policies but aren't necessarily leading me closer to the global optimum. I might have to explore more parameter sets beyond the given examples, especially ones that have lower rewards because perhaps there are multiple local optima.

Given that the user mentioned the global optimum is around 500, it's clear that the best reward isn't in these provided examples. So my next step should be to try a wider range of parameters. Parameters can range from -6.0 to 6.0 with one decimal places, so I have options like [-6.0, ..., 6.0] for each parameter.

I need to consider both positive and negative values because sometimes the optimal point is at the extremes or in between. The exploration step size is set to 1.0, which means I can change parameters incrementally without skipping any points.

One approach could be to systematically vary each parameter one by one while keeping others constant, but that might be time-consuming manually. Alternatively, since it's a linear function (the reward depends on the dot product of state and W plus B), perhaps I can find a way to adjust the parameters proportionally to achieve higher rewards.

Alternatively, maybe adjusting all parameters at once in such a way that the expected reward is maximized. Since each parameter affects different aspects of the state—position, velocity, angle, and angular velocity—it's likely that the optimal params involve balancing these factors appropriately.

I should also consider how changing one parameter affects the reward. For example, increasing the first parameter in W (params[0]) would influence the cart position directly. Similarly, each subsequent parameter influences the other state variables.

Since the reward is a sum of rewards at each time step if the pole remains upright and within bounds, perhaps the optimal params have all these favorable states most of the time. But without knowing the distribution of these states during training, it's hard to say.

Another thought: maybe using an iterative method like gradient ascent could help optimize the reward function. However, since I'm constrained to discrete parameter changes in steps of 1.0, I might need to adjust each parameter step by step, starting from a base point and gradually moving away.

I should also be cautious not to overshoot and get stuck at lower rewards, so perhaps setting an upper bound on the parameters and ensuring that any adjustments within their range are beneficial.

Considering all this, my strategy would be:

1. Start with a baseline set of params.
2. Vary each parameter one by one in both positive and negative directions while keeping others fixed to see if adjusting them can increase the reward.
3. If a particular parameter doesn't improve the reward when adjusted, adjust other parameters first before focusing on it.
4. Continue this process until I reach a point where further adjustments don't yield higher rewards, indicating that perhaps the optimal is somewhere around the current parameters or I need to explore more.

Given the examples provided, some of them have lower rewards than others, which suggests there are multiple local optima. Therefore, exploring beyond the given best results will be crucial in finding the true global optimum.
