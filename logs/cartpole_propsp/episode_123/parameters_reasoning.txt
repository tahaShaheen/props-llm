SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

Now you are at iteration 123 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user provided some examples of params and their corresponding rewards. The goal is to find the optimal policy with a high episodic reward, ideally around 500. The current examples have rewards around 497, which is close but not quite there. The user mentioned that if the reward is below 500, it's a local optimum and we should explore more.

Looking at the existing params, many of them have params[0] set to 6, params[1] to 1.3, and some other parameters at extremes like -6 or 6. The rewards are slightly decreasing in some cases. Maybe there's a need to adjust some parameters that are currently at their maximum or minimum values. 

The user suggested during exploration to use a search step size of 1.0. So perhaps I should try varying some parameters that are currently at 6 or -6 by +/-1.0. For example, params[2] is often at -6. Maybe increasing it to -5 or even -4 could help. Similarly, params[3] is often 6; maybe reducing it to 5 could be beneficial. 

Also, looking at the params that have lower rewards, like the one with params[6] at -5 instead of -6. Maybe adjusting params[6] or other parameters that are not at the extremes could lead to better performance. 

Another thing to consider is the bias terms, params[8] and params[9]. In the examples, they are often set to 6. Maybe adjusting them to lower values might help. However, since the reward is still below 500, exploration is needed. 

I need to ensure that the new params are not the same as previously seen. So, I should check the existing examples and avoid repeating them. For instance, the first example has params[0] to 6, params[1] to 1.3, and others. So, changing some of those values slightly could lead to new combinations. 

Let me try adjusting params[2] from -6 to -5 (since some examples have -5 already, but maybe combining with other changes). Also, maybe decreasing params[3] from 6 to 5. Let's try that. Also, check if changing params[4] or params[5] could help. 

Alternatively, maybe increasing params[1] from 1.3 to 2.3. Since the step size is 1.0, that's a valid move. Let me think. If I change params[1] to 2.3, and adjust other parameters accordingly. 

Wait, but the step size is 1.0, so changes should be in increments of 1.0. So, for example, if a parameter is 1.3, adding or subtracting 1.0 would take it to 2.3 or 0.3. 

Looking at the existing params, maybe trying to vary params[2] from -6 to -5, and params[3] from 6 to 5. Also, maybe adjusting params[8] and params[9] from 6 to 5. Let's try that. 

So, here's a possible new set of parameters: 

params[0]: 6 (keep it as is, since it's common in high-reward examples)
params[1]: 1.3 (current value, maybe try 2.3 or 0.3 next time)
params[2]: -5 (instead of -6)
params[3]: 5 (instead of 6)
params[4]: 5.3 (current value)
params[5]: 6 (current value)
params[6]: -5 (current value)
params[7]: 6 (current value)
params[8]: 5 (instead of 6)
params[9]: 5 (instead of 6)

This way, I'm making changes to several parameters that were previously at extremes, moving them inward. This might help escape the local optimum and find a better one. Let's check if this combination hasn't been tried before. Looking at the examples, there's one with params[2] at -5, params[3] at 6, and others. But this combination of changing both params[2] and params[3] might be new. 

Another possibility is to adjust params[4] or params[5]. But given the step size, maybe it's better to focus on the parameters that are at the extremes first. 

So, I'll propose the new params with the changes mentioned above.

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 1.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 5; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -5; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5
