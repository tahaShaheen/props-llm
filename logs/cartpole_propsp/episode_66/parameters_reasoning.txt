SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 66 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to find the optimal parameters for this cartpole environment using policy gradient methods. The user mentioned that the current parameters are giving around 500, but they want to explore both sides of the maximum. They also provided some examples where f(params) is around 128-99.55.

First, I should understand how the reward function works. It seems like each time the pole stays upright and the cart remains stable, we get a +1 point. If either condition isn't met, the episode ends. The goal is to maximize this cumulative reward.

Looking at the examples given, some parameters result in higher rewards than others. For instance, when params[0] is 6.6 and others are as high as -2.4, the reward is about 157.70. On the lower side, like params[0] = 5.7 with other negative values, it's around 99.55.

I think the function probably has a single maximum point, meaning that exploring both higher and lower parameter values should help find this optimal balance. Since they want to go beyond 500, I should look for parameters in the range where rewards increase up to the peak and then decrease as you move away from it.

Looking at the examples provided, when params[0] is around 6.6, the reward goes up, but after a certain point, if params[0] becomes too high (like 8 or higher), maybe the reward decreases. Similarly, making params[0] more negative might lower the reward again.

I need to choose parameters in this range where f(params) is around 500. I should pick values that are not too extreme on either side but still within the -6.0 to 6.0 range. Maybe a combination like 6.0, -2.4, 0.8, etc., since those seem to be in higher reward areas.

I'll think about how each parameter affects the state and action. params[0] is part of the linear policy function, which includes the cart position, velocity, pole angle, and angular velocity. So adjusting these could influence whether the pole stays upright or the cart doesn't move too much.

To summarize, I should try parameters that are around 6 to -2 on each axis within the given range. This way, I'm exploring both high rewards and low rewards areas without going too far from the current examples.
