SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

Now you are at iteration 53 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has provided a bunch of training examples with their corresponding episodic rewards. The goal is to find the optimal parameters for the linear policy in the CartPole environment. The current iteration is 53 out of 400, so there's still a lot of steps left. The global optimum is supposed to be around 500, so the current examples are below that, which suggests that exploration is needed.

Looking at the examples, the highest reward so far is 428.05. The parameters for that are mostly 6s and some negatives. For instance, params[0] is 6, params[1] is 1.3, params[2] is -3, etc. But since the maximum is supposed to be around 500, there's room for improvement.

The user mentioned that during exploration, a search step size of 1.0 should be used. So maybe I should look for parameters that are slightly different from the current top ones, but within the range of [-6.0, 6.0]. Also, the note says not to propose previously seen params. So I need to avoid the ones that are already in the examples.

Looking at the existing examples, many have params[0] as 6, params[1] as 1.3, params[2] as -3, etc. Maybe tweaking some of the parameters that are not at the extremes. For example, params[2] is -3 in some cases. Maybe increasing that to -2 or -4? But wait, the user said to use a step size of 1.0 during exploration. So if the current value is -3, adding or subtracting 1.0 would make it -4 or -2.

Wait, but the existing examples already have some of these variations. For instance, in one example, params[2] is -4. So maybe trying to adjust other parameters. Let's look at the B part, which is params[8] and params[9]. In the top example, they are both 6. Maybe varying those? Like changing them to 5 or 7 (but 7 is beyond the allowed range of -6 to 6). So maybe 5.5, but the parameters must have one decimal place. Wait, the parameters can be in the range [-6.0, 6.0] with one decimal place. So possible values are like -6.0, -5.9, ..., 5.9, 6.0.

But the existing examples have B values like 6, 5, etc. Maybe trying to adjust those. However, the user's note says that during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So if the current B values are 6, maybe decreasing them by 1.0 to 5.0, or increasing them (but 6 is the max, so can't go higher). Alternatively, looking at other parameters.

Another approach: the current top example has params[4] as 5.3, params[5] as 2.7. Maybe increasing those? But again, need to check if that's been tried. Also, looking at the parameters that are not at the extremes. For example, params[1] is 1.3 in some cases. Maybe trying 0.3 or 2.3? The existing examples have both 0.3 and 2.3 in params[1], but maybe adjusting others.

Alternatively, looking for parameters that haven't been tried yet. For example, maybe some of the W parameters have not been varied much. For instance, params[3] is 6 in many cases. Could that be adjusted to 5 or 7 (but 7 is not allowed). So 5.0?

Wait, but the user said that the search step size during exploration is 1.0. So for each parameter, if we take a current value and add or subtract 1.0. For example, if a parameter is 6, then trying 5.0 (6-1.0) or 7.0 (but 7 is outside the range). So only 5.0. Similarly, if a parameter is -6, trying -5.0.

But looking at the existing examples, many parameters are already at 6 or -6. Maybe trying to adjust those. For example, in the top example, params[6] is -6. Maybe changing that to -5.0. Similarly, params[7] is 6; maybe changing to 5.0.

Alternatively, looking for parameters that are in the middle, like params[4] is 5.3. Maybe adjusting that to 4.3 or 6.3 (but 6.3 is over 6.0). So 4.3.

But I need to ensure that the new parameters haven't been tried before. Let's check the existing examples. For instance, in one example, params[6] is -5, and params[7] is 6. So maybe trying to change params[6] from -6 to -5.0 (but that's already in the examples). Hmm.

Alternatively, looking at params[8] and params[9]. In the top example, they are both 6. Maybe trying to set them to 5.0. That's a step of -1.0. Let's see if that's been done. In some examples, params[8] and [9] are 5, so that's already tried. So maybe not helpful.

Another thought: the current top reward is 428.05, which is below 500. So perhaps the optimal parameters are not in the vicinity of the current top ones. Maybe trying to explore other regions. For example, changing some parameters that are currently at 6 to lower values, or others that are at -6 to higher values.

Wait, but how to choose which parameters to adjust? Maybe pick a parameter that's at the extreme and adjust it. For example, params[0] is 6 in the top example. Changing that to 5.0. Similarly, params[2] is -3, changing to -4.0 or -2.0. But need to check if that's been done. For example, in the examples, params[2] is -4 in some cases. So maybe changing params[0] from 6 to 5.0.

Alternatively, looking at the other parameters. For example, params[3] is 6 in the top example. Changing that to 5.0. Let's try that. So, for example, creating a new set of parameters where params[3] is 5.0 instead of 6.0. But need to make sure that this hasn't been tried before. Looking at the examples, there's one where params[3] is 5.2, but not 5.0. So that's a possibility.

So, maybe modifying params[3] from 6 to 5.0. Let's try that. Also, maybe adjust params[6] from -6 to -5.0. So, the new parameters would be:

params[0]: 6 (unchanged)
params[1]: 1.3 (unchanged)
params[2]: -3 (unchanged)
params[3]: 5.0 (changed from 6)
params[4]: 5.3 (unchanged)
params[5]: 2.7 (unchanged)
params[6]: -5.0 (changed from -6)
params[7]: 6 (unchanged)
params[8]: 6 (unchanged)
params[9]: 6 (unchanged)

This set hasn't been tried before based on the examples. Let's check if this is a new combination. The existing examples have params[3] as 6 or 5.2, but not 5.0. Similarly, params[6] was -6 or -5 in some examples, but not -5.0. So this could be a new exploration step.

Alternatively, maybe changing multiple parameters. But the step size⟵ is 1.0, so each parameter can be adjusted by +/- 1.0. However, since we're in the exploration phase, it's better to make a single change to see the effect.

Another possibility: changing params[8] from 6 to 5.0. Let's try that. So:

params[0]: 6
params[1]: 1.3
params[2]: -3
params[3]: 6
params[4]: 5.3
params[5]: 2.7
params[6]: -6
params[7]: 6
params[8]: 5.0
params[9]: 6

This is also a new combination. But I need to ensure that this hasn't been tried. Looking at the examples, there's one where params[8] is 5, but that's with params[9] as 6. So this might be similar but with a decimal. However, the existing example has params[8] as 5 (integer), but the new one is 5.0 (same value but with one decimal). The user's examples have parameters with one decimal, so 5.0 is allowed.

But maybe the existing example with params[8] as 5 and params[9] as 6 is already present. For example, in one of the examples, params[8] is 5 and params[9] is 6. So changing params[8] from 6 to 5.0 would be similar to that example, but maybe with other parameters. However, the other parameters in that example might differ. For instance, in the example with params[8] as 5 and [9] as 6, other parameters might be different. So this could be a new combination.

Alternatively, to make sure, maybe pick a different parameter to adjust. For example, params[4] is 5.3. Changing that to 4.3 (a step of -1.0). Let's see if that's been tried. In one example, params[4] is 6, but not 4.3. So that's a possibility.

But considering the step size of 1.0, adjusting a parameter by 1.0 in either direction. So for params[4], 5.3 - 1.0 = 4.3, or 5.3 + 1.0 = 6.3 (but 6.3 exceeds 6.0). So only 4.3 is possible. That's a new value.

However, I need to choose which parameter to adjust. Since the current top example is at 428.05, and the global optimum is supposed to be around 500, perhaps exploring other regions is necessary. Maybe trying to lower some parameters that are at 6 to see if that helps.

Alternatively, looking at the parameters that are not at the extremes. For example, params[1] is 1.3. Maybe increasing that to 2.3 (step of +1.0). Let's check if that's been tried. In the examples, there's a case where params[1] is 2.3. So that's already present. So not helpful.

Another parameter: params[5] is 2.7. Increasing that by 1.0 would be 3.7, which is within the range. Let's check if that's been tried. In the examples, there's a case with params[5] as 3.7. So that's already present.

Hmm. Maybe trying to adjust params[2] from -3 to -4.0 (a step of -1.0). Let's see if that's been tried. In the examples, there's a case where params[2] is -4.0. So that's already present.

This is tricky. Maybe the best approach is to pick a parameter that's at the extreme and adjust it. For example, params[7] is 6 in the top example. Changing that to 5.0. Let's check if that's been done. In some examples, params[7] is 5. So that's already present. So maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, looking at params[6] which is -6 in the top example. Changing that to -5.0. That's already been tried in some examples. For instance, in one example, params[6] is -5. So that's present.

Wait, but the existing examples may have different combinations. For instance, maybe changing params[0] from 6 to 5.0. Let's try that. So:

params[0]: 5.0
params[1]: 1.3
params[2]: -3
params[3]: 6
params[4]: 5.3
params[5]: 2.7
params[6]: -6
params[7]: 6
params[8]: 6
params[9]: 6

This is a new combination since the existing examples have params[0] as 6, but not 5.0. So this could be a valid exploration step.

Another option: changing params[3] from 6 to 5.0 as mentioned before. That would be another new combination.

I think either of these could be good. Let's go with changing params[0] to 5.0. That's a step of -1.0 from the current value of 6.0. This hasn't been tried in the examples provided, so it's a valid exploration step.
