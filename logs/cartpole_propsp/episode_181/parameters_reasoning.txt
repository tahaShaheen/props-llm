SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 181 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to find the global optimal policy for the cartpole environment using this linear policy approach. The goal is to balance the pole on the cart without it falling over or moving too far.

First, I remember that the policy is a linear function of the state, which means it's parameterized by 18 parameters (since there are four states: position, velocity, angle, and angular velocity). These parameters are arranged into two matrices, W and B. The W matrix has 4x2=8 elements, and B has 2 elements.

The reward function is quite straightforward: +1 for each time step where the pole is upright (between -0.418 radians) and the cart is within [-2.4, 2.4] meters. Otherwise, the episode ends.

I've read that the global optimum is around 500 steps, but I started at iteration 181 with parameters set to [params[0]:..., params[9]: ...]. Since I don't have access to the reward function's actual values yet, I need to adjust these parameters based on some exploration.

The user mentioned that during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. That means each parameter should be adjusted by ±1 in my initial setup because all parameters are within [-6.0, 6.0]. So I'll start at the current values and move one unit up or down for each parameter as needed.

Looking at the reward examples provided, some have higher rewards (like 420 or 397) while others have lower. But since we're trying to find the maximum, maybe these are not the best starting points yet.

I think the strategy here is to iterate and adjust these parameters so that the reward function increases. Each time I test a new set of parameters (like in step 2-3), I'll compute the f(params) value and see if it's higher than before. If it's higher, I keep moving towards the higher values; if not, I might need to try other combinations.

I should consider changing each parameter one by one, starting from the highest or lowest, because that could significantly affect the reward. For example, increasing W[0][0] would directly influence the cart position, which is part of balancing the pole. Similarly, B[0] affects the cart's velocity, which also plays a role in the system's stability.

I might need to test multiple parameters to see how they interact. Maybe starting with some higher values and then gradually decreasing them as I find that doesn't improve the reward anymore.

Since the step size is 1.0, each change will only affect one parameter at a time, which is manageable without getting bogged down in too many adjustments at once. It should allow me to explore the parameter space efficiently.

I also need to make sure not to propose parameters I've seen before or used elsewhere. So even if my initial set isn't great, I'll adjust it accordingly based on the reward function's feedback.

Finally, after several iterations of adjusting and testing, I should aim for a set of parameters that gives an f(params) value around 500, as per the global optimum suggestion. This might require multiple adjustments and perhaps some backtracking if my initial adjustments didn't yield higher rewards.
