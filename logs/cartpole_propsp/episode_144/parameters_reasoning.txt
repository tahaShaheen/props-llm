SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

Now you are at iteration 144 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user provided some examples of params and their corresponding episodic rewards. The goal is to find the global optimal policy, which they mentioned should be around 500. The first example they showed had a reward of 500.00, which is the highest so far. But the user says that if we're below that, we should explore instead of exploiting.

Looking at the examples, the first one with params[0] to [9] as [6, 2.3, -5, 6, 5.3, 6, -6, 6, 5, 5] gave 500.00. Then other examples have lower rewards. The user is at iteration 144 out of 400, so there's still time to explore.

The instructions say during exploration, use a search step size of 1.0. So maybe I should perturb the parameters from the current best ones. But wait, the first example with 500 is already the best. However, the user says that if we're below 500, we need to explore. Since the first example is at 500, but maybe there's a way to get higher? Or maybe that's the global optimum. However, the user says the global optimum should be around 500, so perhaps that's the max. But maybe there's a way to tweak the parameters to get slightly higher.

Wait, the user also says not to propose previously seen params. The first example is already used, so I can't repeat that. So maybe I need to explore around that. Let's look at the parameters of the first example: params[0] is 6, params[1] is 2.3, params[2] is -5, params[3] is 6, params[4] is 5.3, params[5] is 6, params[6] is -6, params[7] is 6, params[8] is 5, params[9] is 5.

Since the search step is 1.0, maybe I can adjust some parameters by ±1.0. For example, increasing params[1] from 2.3 to 3.3 (as in another example, but that had lower reward). Alternatively, maybe changing other parameters. Let's think about which parameters might be critical.

Looking at the policy: action is argmax(state @ W + B). The state has four elements, and W is a 4x2 matrix. So each of the four state variables is multiplied by the corresponding row in W, then summed with B. The action is the one with higher value between the two.

To maximize the reward, the policy needs to balance the cart and pole. The parameters that might be important are those that influence the cart's position and velocity, and the pole's angle and angular velocity.

In the first example, params[0] is 6, which is the weight for cart position in the first action. Maybe increasing that further could help, but it's already at the maximum of 6.0. Similarly, params[3] is 6.0, which is the weight for cart velocity in the second action. Maybe adjusting other parameters.

Looking at the B terms (params[8] and [9]), they are 5 and 5. Maybe adjusting those. But the user said to use a step size of 1.0 during exploration. So perhaps changing some of the parameters by ±1.0.

For example, take the first example's params and adjust params[1] (which is 2.3) to 3.3 (as in another example, but that had lower reward). Alternatively, maybe decrease params[2] from -5 to -6, but that was in another example with lower reward. Alternatively, increase params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3, but that's beyond the allowed range (max is 6.0). So can't do that.

Alternatively, maybe adjust params[6] from -6 to -5, but that was in another example with lower reward. Hmm. So perhaps trying to change params[8] or [9] from 5 to 6, but that's already in some examples. For instance, the first example had params[8] and [9] as 5 and 5. In another example, they were 6 and 6, but that had lower reward.

Wait, maybe the first example is already the optimal, but since the user says to explore if below 500, but the first example is exactly 500. However, the user says the global optimum should be around 500, so maybe that's it. But the user might want to check if there's a better one. However, since we can't repeat the same params, perhaps perturb some parameters slightly.

Alternatively, maybe the first example is the best, but we need to check nearby values. For instance, changing params[1] from 2.3 to 1.3 (as in some other examples, but that had lower rewards). Or maybe changing params[2] from -5 to -6, but again, that example had lower reward.

Alternatively, maybe changing other parameters. For example, params[4] is 5.3. If we increase it to 6.3, but that's beyond the allowed range. So maybe 6.0. But in the first example, params[4] is 5.3, and in another example, it's 6.0. Let's see, in the first example, params[4] is 5.3, and in another example, params[4] is 6.0. That example had lower reward (495.75). So perhaps 5.3 is better.

Alternatively, maybe changing params[8] from 5 to 6. Let's try that. So take the first example's params, and change params[8] from 5 to 6, keeping others the same. That would be:

params[0]:6, params[1]:2.3, params[2]:-5, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:6, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:6, params[9]:5. Let's see if that's a new param set. The user's examples have one where params[8] and [9] are 6 and 6, but that had lower reward. However, this is a different set, since params[9] is 5 here. Maybe that's a new one to try.

Alternatively, change params[9] from 5 to 6, but that would be similar to the example with lower reward. But maybe trying that. However, the user said not to propose previously seen params. The first example had params[8] and [9] as 5 and 5. The second example had them as 6 and 6. So changing one to 6 and the other to 5 could be a new combination.

So, perhaps trying params[8] as 6 and params[9] as 5. Let me check if that's been done before. Looking at the examples, the second example had params[8] and [9] as 6 and 6. Another example had params[8] as 5 and [9] as 5. So this new combination hasn't been tried yet. So that's a possible candidate.

Alternatively, changing other parameters. For instance, increasing params[1] from 2.3 to 3.3, but that example had lower reward. But maybe trying that again. However, the user said not to propose previously seen params. The example with params[1] as 3.3 had lower reward, but maybe there's a better combination.

Alternatively, maybe adjusting params[2] from -5 to -4, but that's within the range. Let's see. For example, changing params[2] from -5 to -4. But that's a step of +1.0. However, the user says during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So that's allowed.

But which parameters to adjust? Since the first example is the best so far, but we need to explore. Maybe trying to adjust the B terms. Let's try changing params[8] from 5 to 6 (as in the first example's variation) and see.

So, the new params would be:

params[0]:6, params[1]:2.3, params[2]:-5, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:6, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:6, params[9]:5.

This is a new set not seen before. Let me check the examples again. The second example had params[8] and [9] as 6 and 6. The first example had them as 5 and 5. This is 6 and 5, which hasn't been tried yet. So that's a valid new param set to explore.
