SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 368 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.

WARNING: This is attempt 2 out of 10. You have FAILED 1 times already. You have 8 attempts remaining. MAKE SURE THE FORMAT IS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT: 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, ...' with all values in range [-6.0, 6.0]. If you fail again, the entire episode will be discarded.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help this cartpole environment problem where the goal is to find the global optimal policy. The user mentioned that the current parameter setup gives a reward of around 500, which is decent but not the absolute best.

First, I need to understand how the policy works. It's a linear policy with state (cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity) and actions are either push left or right. The current parameters are set in such a way that they give around 500 reward over 400 steps. They provided several top-performing parameter sets which also achieve 500, but the most recent ones have lower rewards.

The user wants me to find a better set of parameters by trying different combinations within the same range (-6.0 to 6.0 with one decimal place). The key is to explore both positive and negative values, especially since the current setup might be stuck in local optima.

I think I should start by exploring different combinations of action values (W's) and B parameters. Maybe trying a few parameters that are higher than the current ones or lower could lead to better rewards. Since reward depends on pole uprightment and cart position, maybe adjusting pole angle more significantly would help.

Also, considering the velocity and pole angular velocity: if the cart is moving too fast (high velocity) or the pole is spinning too much (angular velocity), those should be addressed. Perhaps increasing some of these could prevent them from becoming problematic.

I'll try a few combinations, maybe starting with higher W values for certain actions to see how that affects the reward. I might also experiment with lower parameters in B where they seem to have had negative effects before to see if their impact becomes positive now.

After each trial, I'll note down the reward and adjust my next set based on whether it's better or worse. It might take several iterations but should eventually find a better parameter set that gives an episodic reward higher than 500.
