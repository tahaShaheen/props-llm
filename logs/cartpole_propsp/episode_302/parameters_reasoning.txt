SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 302 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user provided some examples of params and their corresponding rewards. The goal is to find the optimal policy with the highest episodic reward, ideally around 500. The current iteration is 302 out of 400, so there's still time to explore.

Looking at the examples, the top ones have rewards of 500.00. The params that achieved this have certain patterns. For instance, params[0] is 6, params[1] is 2.3, params[2] is -5, params[3] is 6, params[4] is 5.3, params[5] is 6, params[6] is -6, params[7] is 6, params[8] and [9] are 5. There are slight variations in some parameters, but the highest rewards are consistent in these values.

However, the user mentioned that if we're below 500, we should explore instead of exploit. The current examples are already at 500, but maybe there's room for improvement. The challenge is to find a better set of parameters without repeating the ones already tried.

The user also said to use a search step size of 1.0 during exploration. So, I should consider varying some parameters by +/-1.0 from the current values. Let's look at the parameters that might be candidates for adjustment.

Looking at params[2], which is -5 in the best examples. If I increase it by 1.0 to -4, but in the examples, when params[2] was -4, the reward was slightly lower (499.95). Maybe that's not the right direction. What about other parameters?

params[4] is 5.3. If I increase that by 1.0 to 6.3, but the maximum allowed is 6.0. So that's not possible. Maybe decrease it to 4.3? But in one example, that gave a lower reward. Alternatively, maybe adjust params[8] or [9], which are 5.0 in the best cases. Changing them to 6.0 might be worth trying.

Another approach is to look for parameters that haven't been varied much. For example, params[1] is 2.3 in all the top examples. Maybe increasing it to 3.3 or decreasing to 1.3 could help. But in one example, when params[1] was 3.3, the reward dropped to 384.85. That's a big drop, so maybe that's not the way. What about params[7], which is 6.0. Could reducing it to 5.0 help? Not sure.

Alternatively, check parameters that are at the extremes. For example, params[0] is 6.0, which is the maximum allowed. Maybe lowering it slightly to 5.0 could lead to better results? But in the examples, when params[0] was 6.0, the reward was high. Maybe that's a good value.

Another thought: the bias terms B (params[8] and [9]) are both 5.0 in the top examples. Maybe adjusting them could help. For instance, increasing one to 6.0 and keeping the other at 5.0. Let's try that.

So, let's propose a new set of parameters by varying one of the bias terms. Let's take the top example and change params[9] from 5.0 to 6.0. That would be:

params[0]:6, params[1]:2.3, params[2]:-5, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:6, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:5, params[9]:6. But wait, in the examples, when params[9] was 6, the reward was 356.70, which is lower. Hmm, that's worse. Maybe that's not the right move.

Alternatively, maybe adjusting params[6], which is -6.0. If I increase it to -5.0, but in one example, that gave 498.55, which is slightly lower than 500. So that's not better.

What about params[4] (5.3)? Maybe changing it to 5.2 or 5.4. But in the examples, when params[4] was 5.2, the reward was 500.00 as well. So maybe that's not the key.

Wait, looking at the first example, params[4] is 5.3, and when it's 5.2, the reward is still 500. So perhaps that parameter is not critical. Maybe other parameters are more important.

Looking at params[2] (currently -5). If I change it to -6, but in one example that gave a lower reward. What about changing it to -4.5? But the step size is 1.0, so maybe only whole numbers. So -4 or -6. But in the examples, -5 is the best.

Hmm. Maybe the best approach is to explore other parameters that haven't been changed much. For example, params[7] is 6.0. If I lower it to 5.0, but that might not help. Alternatively, params[3] is 6.0. Maybe lowering that to 5.0. But that might not be good.

Alternatively, check if any parameters are at the lower bound. For example, params[2] is -5, which is within the range. Maybe increasing it to -4, but that gave a lower reward. So perhaps not.

Another angle: the current best is 500.00, and the user says the global optimum should be around 500. So maybe we're already at the optimal. But the user says if below 500, explore. But since we are at 500, maybe we need to check if there's a way to get higher. However, the examples show that some variations give the same reward. So maybe there are multiple optimal points.

But the user might want to ensure that we're not stuck in a local optimum. However, since the examples already reach 500, which is the target, maybe that's the best possible. Unless there's a way to get higher than 500, but the problem states that the global optimum should be around 500. So perhaps 500 is the maximum.

In that case, the best approach is to stick with the parameters that give 500. But the user said not to propose previously seen params. So I need to find a new set of parameters that are different but could also achieve 500.

Looking at the examples, the first few have params[4] as 5.3, 5.0, 5.2, etc. Maybe changing params[4] to 5.4, but that's beyond 6.0? No, 5.4 is within the range. But the step size is 1.0. So maybe changing it by 1.0. But 5.3 +1.0 is 6.3, which is over the limit. So not allowed. So maybe 5.3 is the max for that parameter.

Alternatively, check other parameters. For example, params[5] is 6.0. What if we lower it to 5.0? But that might not help. Or maybe change params[1] from 2.3 to 3.3, but that gave a lower reward in the examples.

Alternatively, change params[8] from 5.0 to 6.0. Let's try that. So:

params[0]:6, params[1]:2.3, params[2]:-5, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:6, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:6, params[9]:5. This is a new set, not seen before. Let's see if that could be better.

But I can't test it, so I have to propose it. Since the user said to explore with step size 1.0, and the current best is 500, maybe this is a way to explore.
