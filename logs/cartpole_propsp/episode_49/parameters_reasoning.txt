SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has provided a bunch of previous params and their corresponding rewards. The goal is to find the global optimal policy, which they mention should be around 500. The current best in the examples is 428.05, which is still below 500. So, I need to explore more to find a better solution.

Looking at the existing params, many of them have params[0] set to 6, params[3] to 6, and params[6] to -6, with some variation in other parameters. The rewards are generally decreasing as the parameters deviate from these values. But since the current max is 428, which is lower than the target 500, I should consider exploring new parameter ranges.

The user mentioned that during exploration, a search step size of 1.0 should be used. So, I should look for parameters that are different from the ones already tried. Let me check which parameters are frequently used. For example, params[0] is often 6, but maybe trying lower values could help. Similarly, params[2] is often -3, but maybe trying -4 or -2 might be better.

Wait, the user also said not to propose previously seen params. So I need to ensure that the new params haven't been tried before. Looking at the examples, the first param set has params[0] to 6, params[1] to 1.3, params[2] to -3, etc. So maybe trying a different combination where some parameters are adjusted by 1.0 step. For example, if params[0] was 6, maybe trying 5 or 7 (but 7 is outside the range of -6 to 6, so 5). Similarly, params[3] is often 6, so maybe trying 5 or 7 (but 7 is invalid, so 5).

Another thing to note is the bias terms (params[8] and params[9]). In the examples, they are often set to 6, but maybe lower values could be better. Let me think about the policy function. The action is determined by the maximum of the linear combination of state and weights plus bias. To keep the pole upright, the policy needs to adjust the cart's position and velocity, and the pole's angle and angular velocity. So the weights might need to be tuned to respond appropriately to these states.

Since the current examples have high values in some weights and biases, maybe a more balanced approach could yield better results. For example, if the bias is too high, the action might be biased towards one direction regardless of the state. So perhaps adjusting the bias terms to lower values could help the policy respond more dynamically to the state variables.

Also, looking at the parameters that have been tried, some of them have params[6] set to -6. Maybe trying -5 instead could be a step in the right direction. But I need to make sure not to repeat existing combinations.

Let me try to come up with a new set of parameters that haven't been tried yet. For instance, changing params[0] from 6 to 5, params[1] from 1.3 to 0.3 (as in some examples, but maybe adjusting others). Wait, but I need to ensure that the new params aren't in the previous list. Let me check the existing examples again.

Looking at the first example: params[0] is 6, params[1] 1.3, params[2] -3, params[3] 6, params[4] 5.3, params[5] 2.7, params[6] -6, params[7] 6, params[8] 6, params[9] 6. So if I change params[4] to 4.3 (as in another example), but maybe that's already tried. Alternatively, changing params[4] to 6.3? No, the range is up to 6.0.

Alternatively, maybe adjusting params[2] from -3 to -4, but that's already in some examples. Hmm. Maybe trying a different approach. Since the user mentioned that the global optimum is around 500, which is higher than the current examples, I need to explore more aggressively.

Perhaps trying a combination where some of the weights are negative. For example, in the existing examples, params[2] is -3, which is negative. Maybe increasing that to -4 or -5. But some examples already have that. Let me check the last few entries.

The last example has params[0] 5, params[1] 0.3, params[2] -4, params[3] 5.2, etc. So maybe trying a different set where params[0] is 5, params[1] is 2.3, and others are adjusted. Wait, but I need to make sure that this hasn't been tried before. The user's examples have a lot of variation, but maybe there's a new combination.

Alternatively, trying to set some of the weights to 0. Let's see. For example, setting params[0] to 0, but that might be too drastic. However, the search step size is 1.0, so maybe adjusting from existing values by ±1.0.

Another thought: the current best is 428.05. To reach 500, maybe there's a better combination where some parameters are set to different values. For example, if params[8] and params[9] are set to lower values, like 5 instead of 6, but that's already tried in some examples.

Wait, looking at the first example, when params[8] and [9] are 6, the reward is 428.05. In the second example, they are 5 and 5, and the reward is 413.65. So lower bias might be worse. But maybe there's a sweet spot where the bias is adjusted in some other way.

Alternatively, perhaps the weights for the pole's angular velocity (params[6] and [7]) need to be adjusted. In some examples, params[6] is -6 and [7] is 6. Maybe trying params[6] as -5 and [7] as 5? But that's already tried in some examples.

I think I need to make a new set of parameters that hasn't been tried yet. Let's try changing params[0] from 6 to 5, params[1] from 1.3 to 2.3 (since in some examples, 2.3 is used), params[2] from -3 to -4, params[3] from 6 to 5, params[4] from 5.3 to 6, params[5] from 2.7 to 3.7 (but that's outside the range?), no, the range is up to 6.0. Wait, 3.7 is within -6 to 6. So maybe that's a possibility. But I need to check if this combination has been tried before.

Alternatively, let's take the first example and change one parameter. For example, the first example has params[0] 6, params[1] 1.3, params[2] -3, params[3] 6, params[4] 5.3, params[5] 2.7, params[6] -6, params[7] 6, params[8] 6, params[9] 6. If I change params[8] to 5 and params[9] to 5, that's already in the second example, which had a lower reward. So maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, change params[0] to 6, params[1] to 1.3, params[2] to -3, params[3] to 6, params[4] to 5.3, params[5] to 2.7, params[6] to -6, params[7] to 5, params[8] to 6, params[9] to 6. That's a new combination where params[7] is 5 instead of 6. Let me check if that's in the previous examples. Looking through the list, I don't see that exact combination. So this could be a candidate.

Alternatively, changing params[7] to 5 might help. But I'm not sure. Another approach is to look for parameters that have been underexplored. For example, in the existing examples, params[0] is often 6 or 5, but maybe trying 4 or -6. However, the user said to search both positive and negative values. So maybe trying params[0] as -6?

But that might be too extreme. Let me think. The policy is a linear function, so the weights could be positive or negative. However, in the current examples, the weights are mostly positive. Maybe trying a mix of positive and negative values could lead to better performance.

Another idea: in the existing examples, params[6] is often -6, but maybe trying -5. Let's see. For example, take the first example and change params[6] from -6떫

Okay, I think I need to make a new set of parameters that hasn't been tried yet. Let's go with the following:

params[0]: 5 (instead of 6)
params[1]: 2.3 (a new value)
params[2]: -4 (already tried, but maybe combined with others)
params[3]: 5 (instead of 6)
params[4]: 6 (max value)
params[5]: 3.7 (within range)
params[6]: -5 (instead of -6)
params[7]: 5 (instead of 6)
params[8]: 5 (instead of 6)
params[9]: 5 (instead of 6)

This combination hasn't been in the previous examples, so it's a new exploration. The changes are made by adjusting each parameter by ±1.0 from existing values, which fits the exploration step size. Let's write that out.
</think>

params[0]: 5, params[1]: 2.3, params[2]: -4, params[3]: 5, params[4]: 6, params[5]: 3.7, params[6]: -5, params[7]: 5, params[8]: 5, params[9]: 5
