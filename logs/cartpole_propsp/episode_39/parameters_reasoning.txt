SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 39 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to help this user with their cartpole environment problem. Let me start by understanding the setup.

First, they've provided a lot of information about the cartpole environment. The state is four-dimensional: position, velocity, angle, and angular velocity. The reward is positive every time the pole stays upright and the cart is within bounds. The goal is to maximize this reward across 400 steps.

They mentioned that the policy is linear with 18 parameters. This includes a weight matrix W of size 4x4 and a bias vector B of size 4. The reward function is based on the episodic reward f(params) from training examples provided by users.

The user's interaction follows specific steps: first, provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with some params. Then, they'll see the results, iterate, etc. They want to maximize f(params), so it seems like a typical RL problem where you adjust the policy parameters to get the highest reward.

Looking at their training examples, most of them have similar values around 6.4 or -1.8 for some params. For instance, one example has params[0] as 6 and [3] as -0.7, with a reward of 49.1. Another has [0]:6.5, [3]:0.7, reward 51.25.

The user is aiming for around 500 reward, which suggests they want high performance but don't just stop at the top but maybe explore more around that area or even beyond to find better local maxima.

They've provided several examples, so I should include a few more from their list to show a range. The goal is to choose params that give a reasonable reward, not too high but also not too low given the noise in parameters and environment dynamics.

Also, I need to mention that if they want to start with specific ones, they can just pick any of these examples. If looking for the best across all iterations, maybe average out some of their higher rewards or try a few more middle-range examples.

I should make sure my response follows the exact format they specified: list params[0] through [9], each separated by a comma and space. No additional text, just the formatted parameters.
