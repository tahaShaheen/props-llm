SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to maximize the function's value f(params) for this cartpole environment using a linear policy with 18 parameters. The user has given me some examples and wants me to propose new param values around 500, which is the expected maximum.

First, I need to understand how the reward works. The reward is +1 every time step if the pole is upright and the cart is within bounds. So the policy's success depends on keeping the pole balanced and keeping the cart stable. The user provided some top-performing parameters that scored around 450-437 points, which suggests that higher values are better.

The goal is to find param[0] through param[9], each with one decimal place between -6.0 and 6.0, such that the episodic reward f(params) is maximized. Since I have to propose these parameters based on some reasoning rather than just random guessing, I should think about what would make the cartpole last longer, which depends on keeping the pole upright.

I also need to consider if any of the parameters are critical for balancing the pole—like the velocity in the pole's angle or the pole's own angular velocity. If these can be adjusted, maybe pushing them further to control better could help maintain balance over time.

Moreover, the cart position and velocity should ideally stay within [-2.4, 2.4] and (-inf, inf) respectively for better stability. But since I'm focusing on parameters that directly influence pole balance, I might not need to tweak those unless they significantly affect performance.

I should also think about the structure of the linear policy. The W matrix has four rows (since state is 4-dimensional), each with two elements. The B vector adds one more parameter for a bias term. So if I can find an optimal combination of these, it might lead to better rewards.

Wait, but since the reward only increments when certain conditions are met (pole upright and cart within bounds), maybe focusing on keeping the pole upright is key. Perhaps increasing the angle or adding torque that stabilizes the pole could help, which translates to adjusting parameters in W or B.

I should also consider any potential negative impacts, like if too much force is applied, it might cause damage by pushing the cart beyond limits, but since I'm aiming for maximum reward, maybe focusing on balance over time is more important than avoiding damage. But I'm not entirely sure how to translate this into parameter values.

Maybe starting with some parameters set higher in areas that control pole stability would be beneficial. For example, increasing B[2] and B[3], which are the angular velocity terms for pole angle and pole velocity, could help keep the pole from wobbling too much. Similarly, adjusting W's elements to better handle the velocities might contribute.

I also need to ensure that these parameters don't conflict with each other, as they all influence different aspects of state transitions. For instance, the cart's velocity affects both position and acceleration, which could be used in pushing the pole up or down. Balancing these might require a well-considered combination.

Lastly, after setting my proposed param values, I should evaluate f(params) to see if it indeed improves upon previous examples and then iterate based on feedback from interactions.
