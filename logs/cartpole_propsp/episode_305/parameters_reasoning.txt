SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 305 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has provided a bunch of previous parameter sets and their corresponding rewards. The goal is to find the optimal parameters that maximize the episodic reward. From the examples, it looks like some parameters are around 500, which is the target mentioned. The current iteration is 305 out of 400, so there's still room to explore.

Looking at the top examples, the ones with the highest rewards (500.00) have params[0] at 6, params[1] at 2.3, params[2] at -5, params[3] at 6, params[4] at 5.3, params[5] at 6, params[6] at -6, params[7] at 6, params[8] and [9] at 5. However, some variations in these parameters lead to lower rewards. For instance, when params[4] is 5.2 or 4.3, the reward drops. Also, changing params[3] to 5 or params[2] to -4 or -5.3 affects the reward.

The user mentioned that the global optimum should be around 500, but if we're below that, we need to explore more. Since we're at iteration 305, maybe it's time to do some exploration. The previous examples show that small changes in certain parameters can lead to lower rewards, so maybe adjusting some of the parameters that have been kept constant so far could help.

Looking at the parameters, params[4] and [5] are both at 5.3 and 6. Maybe increasing params[4] slightly to 5.4 or 5.5 could help. Also, params[7] is at 6; perhaps trying a lower value like 5.9 or 5.8 might be beneficial. Additionally, params[8] and [9] are both at 5. Changing one of them to 5.1 or 5.2 might explore new areas.

But since the user said to use a search step size of 1.0 during exploration, maybe making a bigger change. For example, changing params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3, but that might be too much. Wait, the parameters are in the range [-6.0, 6.0], so 6.3 is invalid. So the maximum is 6.0. Maybe adjusting params[4] to 6.0 and see. Alternatively, trying to vary other parameters that haven't been changed much. For instance, params[1] is 2.3 in all the top examples. Maybe increasing it to 3.3 (as in one of the examples) but that led to a lower reward. So maybe that's not the way. Alternatively, decreasing it to 1.3 or 2.2.

Another parameter that's been varied is params[6], which was -6 in some cases and -5 in others. Maybe changing that to -6.0 again. Also, params[2] is -5 in most cases, but in one example it was -4, leading to lower reward. So keeping params[2] at -5 seems better.

Hmm. Maybe the key is to keep most of the parameters as in the top examples but tweak a few. For example, changing params[7] from 6 to 5.0 (a step of -1.0), or params[4] from 5.3 to 6.0. Let's try that. Also, maybe adjust params[8] or [9] from 5 to 6, but in one example changing [9] to 6 led to lower reward. So perhaps that's not the way. Alternatively, adjusting B parameters (params[8] and [9]) slightly.

Wait, the user said to explore with a step size of 1.0. So maybe take one of the parameters that's been fixed and add or subtract 1.0. Let's pick params[4], which is 5.3. Adding 1.0 would make it 6.3, which is over the limit. So can't do that. Subtracting 1.0 would make it 4.3, which was tried before and led to lower reward. So maybe not. How about params[7], which is 6.0. Subtracting 1.0 makes it 5.0. Let's try that. So params[7] becomes 5.0. Also, maybe adjust params[8] from 5 to 6.0 (but in one example that led to lower reward). Alternatively, adjust params[9] from 5 to 6.0. But that might not be good. Alternatively, adjust params[2] from -5 to -6.0. Let's see. That could be a step of -1.0. But in the examples, params[2] was -5, and changing to -6 might be a new exploration. Let's try that.

So, let's create a new parameter set by changing params[2] from -5 to -6.0, and params[7] from 6.0 to 5.0. Let's see:

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 2.3, params[2]: -6, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 5.3, params[5]: 6, params[6]: -6, params[7]: 5, params[8]: 5, params[9]: 5. 

This is a new set not seen before. Let's check if this is within the range. All parameters are between -6 and 6. Yes. So this could be a candidate. Alternatively, changing params[7] to 5.0 and keeping others as before. That might be a good exploration step. Let's go with that.

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -6; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 5; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5
