SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.
--- TOP 3 BEST PERFORMING PARAMS ---
params[0]: 6; params[1]: 6; params[2]: -3; params[3]: 6; params[4]: -6; params[5]: 1.8; params[6]: -3.5; params[7]: 4.5; params[8]: -2.5; params[9]: -2.5; f(params): 500.00

Now you are at iteration 305 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to get the global optimal policy for the cartpole environment using this RL approach. The user mentioned that currently, at iteration 305 of 400 steps, they have a reward ( episodic reward ) f(params) of 500.00. They also provided some top and most recent params.

First, I need to understand how the policy is set up. It's a linear policy with action = max(state @ W + B), where state is [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]. The parameters are 18 in total (W has 4x2 and B has 2 params). So each parameter can be adjusted to change the policy.

The reward function gives +1 for every time step when the pole is upright (angle between -0.418 and 0.418 radians) and cart is within [-2.4, 2.4]. The episode ends if the pole falls over or cart goes out of bounds.

They provided several examples of params that give a reward of 500.00. For instance, when params[0] is 6 and others are set accordingly. But they also have some negative values for other parameters which might be leading to similar results but being local optima.

The user's goal is to find the global optimum around 500 reward. So their exploration so far has already given them that reward, but perhaps there's a better set of params nearby that can achieve higher rewards or have better performance.

Since they're using a linear policy and are exploring both positive and negative values with step size 1.0 during exploration, I should consider increasing the range of parameters to find even better combinations around the current best.

They might benefit from trying param values within a slightly larger range than before, like from -6.0 to 6.0 with one decimal place, to see if moving beyond that would lead to higher rewards or different behavior patterns.

I should also consider other parameters. For example, cart_position and velocity are state variables. The current params set cart_position at 4, which is within bounds but maybe pushing it harder. Perhaps adjusting those could help balance the pole's control better.

Pole angle and angular velocity—these are angles that can swing quite a bit. They might be too extreme, leading to potential instability if not controlled properly. Maybe adjusting them towards more moderate values could improve stability without affecting the reward as much.

Additionally, other parameters like params[3] and [7], which control the pole's movement, might play roles in balancing between pole stabilization and cart velocity. Adjusting these might help prevent the cart from moving too quickly when it should be stationary or vice versa.

I also need to think about how often they should sample new params. Since they're already at 305 steps of exploration, perhaps continuing until iteration 400 would give them more data points to converge towards the optimal solution.

Overall, I should suggest adjusting several parameters within a reasonable range around the current values but with a broader search to explore both positive and negative directions beyond what's currently used. This could help in finding a better policy that maximizes the episodic reward without getting stuck on local optima.
