SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 194 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to find the global optimal policy for the cartpole environment using this linear policy approach. The parameters are given as an array of 10 values with one decimal place each, and they're all within [-6.0, 6.0]. 

The goal is to maximize the episodic reward f(params), which counts every time step where the pole is upright and the cart is stable. If the pole falls or the cart goes out of bounds, the episode ends.

I remember that in this problem, each action is either -1 (push left) or 1 (push right). The policy is linear, meaning it's a function of the state multiplied by some weights (the W matrix) plus biases (B), and then taking the argmax. So, for the state [cart_pos, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_velocity], the action is determined by this equation.

I have several examples provided where different params yield certain rewards. Each iteration involves trying a set of params and getting a reward f(params). The user wants me to propose new params values based on these examples, aiming for a reward around 500.

Looking at the top performing params:
- One example has f=437.80 with params[-4.5; -3.5; 1.6; -1; -4.5; 1.5; 1.5; 4; -2.5; -2.5]
- Another has f=420.05 with similar values but different pole_angle.
- Third is f=397.95, which is lower because pole_angle seems worse here.

The most recent example at iteration 194 had params[-4.5;6;1.5;-1;-4.5;1.5;-3.5;4.5;-2.5;-2.5] with f=100.35, which is very low because the pole is falling and cart too far.

I need to find a set of params that gives around 500 reward without going too low. I should avoid using previous better params (like those with higher rewards) since they might be local maxima. Instead, I'll mix parameters from both high and medium reward examples.

Maybe start by mixing the negative and positive pole angles to find a balance where pole is upright but not falling too easily. Also, perhaps adjust cart velocity slightly to ensure it's stable.

I should aim for params that have a mix of values around 0-6 but without extreme negatives or positives except as needed.
