SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what parameters will maximize the reward for this cartpole environment using a linear policy. The goal is to balance the pole and keep the cart within its bounds. 

First, looking at the top-performing params provided, like [6, 6, -3, 6, -6, 1.8, -3.5, 4.5, -2.5, -2.5], they're getting a reward of 500. That's pretty high, which is good. But I'm not sure if that's the absolute maximum yet.

I remember that when training RL policies, it's important to explore different actions and states to find the optimal policy. In this case, since it's a linear policy, each parameter affects the action in a linear way, so increasing or decreasing them will change how the cart is pushed left or right.

I should probably start by adjusting the parameters that seem to have positive effects on the reward. Looking at the top params, actions 0 and 1 (left and right) are both being used when pushing, but not sure yet. Maybe the pole angle (-3.5) isn't as bad as -6? Or maybe it's better to adjust the cart velocity?

Wait, in the top params, B is [-2.5, -2.5]. That might influence the action taken based on the state. If the cart velocity is negative (since state[1] is being used in the linear function), would that mean the policy is more likely to push left or right? Hmm.

I also notice some params like [6, 6, -3, 6, -6, 1.8, ...], which have a mix of positive and negative values. Maybe I should balance them so that both directions are explored enough without over-restricting one direction too much.

Perhaps starting by trying to increase the push-right action (params[1] being higher) could help in scenarios where pushing right might stabilize the pole. But if it's too aggressive, maybe it will cause more oscillations or lose balance.

I should also consider the pole angle (-3.5). If that's too low, the pole might be unstable. Maybe a slight increase there would provide better stabilization without making the cart move too much.

Looking at params[0] and [1], which are for the cart position: 6 is within the range, but maybe pushing too hard on both sides isn't optimal. Perhaps reducing these could prevent excessive movement that's dangerous or unstable.

The action space is binary (push left/right), so each parameter corresponds to a specific direction in the policy function. So if I adjust params[0] and [1], I can influence which actions are more likely, balancing between both directions.

I think a good starting point would be to see what happens when I slightly increase or decrease these parameters based on their current values. Maybe try 5.9 instead of 6 in some places to see if it improves the reward without causing too much oscillation.

Also, perhaps looking at other params like [3], which is for pole angular velocity: -2.5 seems moderate, but maybe adjusting it slightly up could help stabilize the pole better when pushing harder.

I should also think about the rewards. The current top parameters give 500. If that's still too low or not the maximum, I need to push further by trying more parameters around these values. Maybe try varying a few of them up and down to see how it affects the reward without making any single parameter dominate.

In summary, my plan is to adjust several parameters slightly, test their effect on the reward, and iterate until I find the optimal combination that gives the highest reward as per the given params range.
