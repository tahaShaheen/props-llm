SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 158 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to help this user with their cartpole environment problem. Let me go through the details step by step.

First, the user provided a lot of information about their RL policy setup. They have a linear policy with 18 parameters. The state consists of four elements: cart position, velocity, pole angle, and angular velocity. Their current parameters are in the range of -6 to +6 with one decimal place. The reward is given as +1 each time the pole stays upright within bounds.

The user wants me to find the global optimal policy by training the agent using 400 steps and providing specific parameter values after a certain number of interactions. They mentioned that in each interaction, they'll provide 4 parameters, then I'll see up to 15 best performing ones and 5 most recent, followed by their current iteration.

In my first interaction, I need to propose the top 9 best-performing parameters. The user showed several different parameter sets with their respective f(params) values. After analyzing these, I selected the one with the highest reward in each batch (15), which was:

params[0]: -4.5; params[1]: -3.5; params[2]: 1.5; params[3]: -1; params[4]: -4.5; params[5]: 1.5; params[6]: -3.5; params[7]: 4.5; params[8]: -2.5; params[9]: -2.5

This had the highest reward of 332.60, so I used these parameters in my next interaction.

In the second interaction, I followed up with providing the most recent 3 best parameters from their list:

params[0]: -4.5; params[1]: -3.5; params[2]: 1.5; params[3]: -1; params[4]: -4.5; params[5]: 1.5; params[6]: -3.5; params[7]: 4.5; params[8]: -2.5; params[9]: -2.5

Then, I used these to run the policy evaluation and training.

After this interaction, the user provided my current iteration count as 158 out of 400. Since the global optimum is around 500, they want me to continue searching beyond their current interactions to see if a better reward can be achieved.

So, I'll use the last parameters from their most recent interaction and run the policy evaluation once more. They provided my current iteration as 158, so I need to make sure I provide enough information for them to proceed with that step.

I should start by proposing these two sets of parameters (from both interactions) in a comma-separated string format, ensuring they fit within the specified range and have one decimal place.
