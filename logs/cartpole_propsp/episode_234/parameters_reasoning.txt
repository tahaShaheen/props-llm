SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to find the global optimal policy for this cartpole environment using a linear policy. The user has provided some parameters and their corresponding episodic rewards, and they want me to help them explore these parameters in a systematic way.

First, I understand that the cartpole is a reinforcement learning problem where the goal is to balance a pole on a cart without it slipping. The state includes the cart position, velocity, pole angle, and angular velocity. The actions are pushing left or right (0 or 1). The reward is +1 every time step if the pole is upright and the cart is within bounds.

The policy is linear, which means it can be represented as a neural network with 4 input features (state) and 2 output actions (W and B), leading to 18 parameters. The user wants me to explore different parameter values in a way that maximizes f(params), the episodic reward.

I notice that the current best parameters have an average reward of around 397. So, I need to find better parameters. Since the optimal is expected to be around 500, my goal is to reach that by exploring the parameter space thoroughly without getting stuck in a local optimum.

The user mentioned that during exploration, search step size of 1.0 should be used. That means if I'm at one set of parameters, I can try adding or subtracting small values (like +/- 0.5) and evaluate the reward to see where the improvement is steeper. If moving by 1 gives a better reward than moving by 0.5, I might focus on that area.

However, I should also consider that some parameters are more important than others. For instance, cart velocity has a huge impact because if it's too high or low, it can cause instability. Similarly, the pole angle affects balance directly. So, my exploration strategy needs to be balanced—first looking at the most impactful parameters before moving on to less critical ones.

The current best parameter set is (-4.5; -3.5; 1.8; -1; -6; 1.8; -3.5; 4.5; -2.5; -2.5) with an average reward of around 397. I can start by perturbing each parameter individually to see how sensitive the reward is to changes in that parameter.

For example, if I increase the cart velocity (params[1]) slightly while keeping other parameters constant, does the reward improve? If yes, maybe I should focus on adjusting params[1]. But I also need to check if there's a balance between increasing and decreasing other parameters that might offset this change in one parameter.

I should also be cautious about not just focusing on the most impactful parameter. Sometimes, even a small adjustment in another parameter can lead to significant gains overall because it affects multiple aspects of the state space—like velocity affecting pole angle directly, etc.

Another point is that the reward function is piecewise linear and convex. This means I don't have to worry about local optima once I've found a good region. But exploring around the current best parameters in a systematic way can help me find better regions quickly without getting stuck in the local optimum trap.

I also need to consider that higher velocities or angles could lead to penalties if not controlled properly, which would reduce the reward. So, my exploration should aim for parameters where the state is stable and easily controllable, avoiding situations where the pole might tip over or the cart becomes unstable.

Additionally, I'm thinking about how to structure my search. Maybe using a grid-based approach around each parameter's current value with varying step sizes could help find regions that yield better rewards. But since each step is 1.0 in size as per instructions, perhaps starting small and gradually increasing the step size if needed would be more efficient.

I also wonder about the computational cost. For each parameter set I test, I'll need to run the policy's function f(params) multiple times (like 5) and average the result. So, my exploration should be balanced between computational feasibility and the risk of getting stuck in a local maximum.

Overall, my plan is to:

1. Start with the current best parameters as a reference point.
2. Perform small perturbations on each parameter individually, evaluating the reward each time.
3. Focus more on parameters that seem to have a bigger impact on the reward based on these initial tests.
4. Gradually incorporate other parameters after identifying critical ones.
5. Keep track of rewards to prioritize which parameters to adjust next.

I also need to make sure not to propose any previously seen parameter sets, so I'll use new random seeds each time for fair comparison. By methodically exploring the parameter space and focusing on the most influential aspects first, I aim to efficiently find the global optimal policy without missing out on better rewards.
