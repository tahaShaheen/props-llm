SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 143 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help someone find the global optimal policy for the cartpole environment using a linear policy. They mentioned that the function f(params) is around 500, which is good. The goal is to set params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with one decimal places.

First, I look at their current interaction where they've set some params and saw certain f(params). They have provided up to 15 top params and 5 most recent ones. From that data, it seems like higher values for params[2] (which controls pole angle) are better, while params[8] is negative but not too bad.

I notice that at iteration 143, the current f(params) is around 9.65, which is quite low compared to their goal of 500. So I need to adjust the parameters to get a higher reward. The highest rewards are achieved when the pole is upright and within bounds, so increasing params[8] (the cart velocity) might help with that.

Also, the best performing params have negative values for some actions, which suggests that sometimes it's better to apply more force than others. For instance, action 0 (-1 in params) gives a reward when the pole is upright and cart is stable.

I should try setting some higher positive values for the beneficial parameters like params[2] (pole angle), params[8] (cart velocity), and maybe params[3], [4], etc. But I shouldn't set them too high because that might cause instability. Similarly, negative values can be used to explore other regions.

I'll propose a new set of params: higher for pole angle, lower for cart velocity to encourage stability, and perhaps some positive action 0 when the state is favorable. This should aim toward the goal reward.
