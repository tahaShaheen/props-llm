SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 379 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to help this user with their cartpole environment and parameters. Let me break down what I understand.

First, the problem is about training a policy for the cartpole environment. The goal is to balance the pole as long as possible without the cart tipping over. The reward is positive when the pole is upright and the cart stays within bounds. If the pole falls or the cart goes out of bounds, the episode ends.

The user mentioned that the global optimal should be around 500, which I think refers to the episodic reward they're aiming for. So their goal is to maximize this reward by adjusting the policy parameters.

They provided a lot of information about the current state and how f(params) (the episodic reward function) is calculated based on the parameter vector params. The current best param values give an episode reward of 500, which is good but not necessarily the maximum. They want to explore further by suggesting new parameters.

The user also set up a way for me to input param values and see how it affects f(params). They want me to propose several param sets that are near the current best, ensuring I don't revisit any previously seen ones, try different combinations in both positive and negative directions, and aim for higher rewards.

Since I'm the one interacting with them, I need to come up with new params values based on the exploration strategy described. Each time I provide a param set, they can see if it's better or worse than the current best, but importantly, I have to avoid repeating previous sets.

I should aim for parameters that might push the f(params) above 500 and try to get higher rewards by exploring different angles in both directions. Let me think about how the params affect the reward. The first parameter is cart_position, next velocity, pole angle, and angular velocity. So, I can tweak each of these a bit while keeping them within [-6.0, 6.0] with one decimal places.

Maybe try pushing some parameters higher in positive directions and others lower to see if that improves the reward. Also, considering the pole's position and velocity could help balance it better. For instance, maybe increasing the cart_position parameter more or changing the pole angle might help.

I should test each new param set step by step. After providing a few, I'll let them know how they react, whether it's higher, lower, or same as before. This way, I can guide their exploration effectively without giving away any specific optimal values.
