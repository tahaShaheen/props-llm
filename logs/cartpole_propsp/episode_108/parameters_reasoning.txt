SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to optimize the parameters for a linear policy in the CartPole environment. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward, which they mentioned should be around 500. The current examples show that the best so far is 492.25. But they want to get closer to 500.

Looking at the provided examples, the top-performing params have some patterns. For instance, params[0] is often 6, params[1] is 1.3, params[2] is -6, params[3] is 6, and so on. The bias terms (params[8] and [9]) are frequently 6. But the highest reward here is 492.25, which is still below 500. The user says that if we're below 500, we should explore more instead of exploiting.

The current iteration is 108 out of 400, so there's still time for exploration. The instructions mention using a search step size of 1.0 during exploration. That means varying the parameters by ±1.0 from their current values. But we need to avoid repeating previous params.

Looking at the existing examples, many have params[0] at 6, but maybe trying lower values could help. Also, params[2] is often -6, but perhaps adjusting that. The user mentioned both positive and negative values should be explored. 

Wait, the current top params have some parameters at extremes (like 6 or -6). Maybe there's a better combination where some parameters are adjusted. For example, in the first example, params[4] and [5] are 5.3 and 5.7. Maybe increasing those slightly? But they can't go beyond 6.0.

Alternatively, looking at the bias terms. The current examples have params[8] and [9] as 6. Maybe reducing them a bit? Or increasing? Not sure. But since the user says to explore, perhaps varying them.

Another thought: the policy is a linear function. The action is determined by the maximum of the two linear combinations (state @ W + B). So, the weights W and bias B need to be such that the correct action is chosen based on the state.

In the CartPole problem, the optimal strategy is to push the cart in the direction that moves the pole back towards upright. So, maybe the weights for the pole angle and angular velocity are critical. For example, if the pole is leaning to the left (negative angle), the cart should be pushed to the right (action 1). So, the weights for the pole angle might need to be positive for action 1 and negative for action 0. But since the policy is linear, the W matrix and B vector need to encode this.

But how does that translate into the parameters? Let's think about the state vector [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]. For each of these, the weights W are structured as two rows (for the two actions). The action is the one with the higher value.

So, for example, if the pole angle is positive (leaning right), the policy should push left (action 0) to bring it back. Therefore, the weights for pole_angle in action 0 (params[4]) should be positive, so that when the angle is positive, the value for action 0 is higher. Similarly, for action 1, the weight might be negative. But I'm not entirely sure. This might require more analysis.

Alternatively, looking at the existing params, the highest reward example has params[4] as 5.3 and params[5] as 5.7. Maybe increasing those could help. But since they are already close to 6, perhaps there's a limit.

Another approach: since the user says the global optimum is around 500, and the current best is 492.25, we need to explore more. So, the next step is to generate new params by varying existing ones by ±1.0. But we need to avoid previously seen params.

Looking at the existing examples, the first example has params[0] as 6, params[1] as 1.3, params[2] as -6, params[3] as 6, params[4] as 5.3, params[5] as 5.7, params[6] as -6, params[7] as 6, params[8] as 6, params[9] as 6. The reward is 492.25.

To explore, perhaps decrease params[0] from 6 to 5, or increase params[1] from 1.3 to 2.3 (but that was tried in one of the examples and gave lower reward). Alternatively, adjust params[2] from -6 to -5, but that was tried in some examples. 

Wait, the user mentioned that during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So, for each parameter, we can try adding or subtracting 1.0. Let's consider each parameter:

params[0] is 6.0 in many examples. Maybe try 5.0 or 7.0 (but 7 is beyond the range). So 5.0.

params[1] is 1.3. Try 0.3 or 2.3. But 2.3 was tried in one example and gave lower reward.

params[2] is -6.0. Try -5.0 or -7.0 (but -7 is invalid). So -5.0.

params[3] is 6.0. Try 5.0 or 7.0 (7 is invalid). So 5.0.

params[4] is 5.3. Try 4.3 or 6.3 (but 6.3 is over 6.0, so 4.3 or 6.0).

params[5] is 5.7. Try 4.7 or 6.7 (so 4.7 or 6.0).

params[6] is -6.0. Try -5.0.

params[7] is 6.0. Try 5.0.

params[8] and [9] are 6.0. Try 5.0 or 7.0 (but 7 is invalid). So 5.0.

But we need to generate a new set of params that haven't been tried before. Let's pick one of these variations. For example, changing params[0] to 5.0, params[2] to -5.0, params[3] to 5.0, params[4] to 4.3, params[5] to 4.7, params[6] to -5.0, params[7] to 5.0, and params[8] and [9] to 5.0. That would be a new set of params. But I need to check if this has been tried before. Looking at the examples, the third example had params[0] as 5, params[2] as -5, params[3] as 5, params[4] as 5.3, params[5] as 5.7, params[6] as -5, params[7] as 5, params[8] as 5, params[9] as 5. So that's different from the proposed changes here. So this new set might be untried.

Alternatively, maybe changing params[0] to 6.0, params[1] to 0.3 (as in one example), but that gave lower reward. Hmm.

Another idea: since the current best is 492.25, and the user says the global optimum is around 500, perhaps we need to make more aggressive changes. For example, increasing some parameters that are currently lower. But how?

Alternatively, looking at the parameters that are at the extremes. For instance, params[2] is -6.0. Maybe changing that to -5.0, and see. Similarly, params[3] is 6.0, changing to 5.0. But that's similar to previous steps.

Wait, the user's instruction says to explore both positive and negative values. So maybe trying some parameters that are not at the extremes. For example, setting some parameters to 0.0. But that's a big change. However, the step size is 1.0, so maybe only changing by that amount.

Alternatively, perhaps trying to adjust the bias terms. In the current examples, the bias is 6.0 for both. Maybe lowering them to 5.0 and see if that helps. But again, this is just a guess.

Another approach: looking for parameters that haven't been tried. For example, in the existing examples, params[1] is mostly 1.3 or 0.3 or 2.3. Maybe trying 1.3 ±1.0, so 0.3 or 2.3. But 2.3 was tried and gave lower reward. So maybe 0.3.

But this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to generate a new set of parameters based on the exploration step. Let's take the first example (params[0]: 6; params[1]: 1.3; params[2]: -6; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 5.7; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 6; params[9]: 6) and vary some parameters by ±1.0. Let's pick params[0] to 5.0, params[1] to 2.3 (but that's already tried?), params[2] to -5.0, params[3] to 5.0, params[4] to 6.0 (since 5.3 +1=6.3 which is over, so 6.0), params[5] to 6.0, params[6] to -5.0, params[7] to 5.0, params[8] and [9] to 5.0. 

So the new params would be:

params[0] = 5.0

params[1] = 2.3 (but check if that's been tried. In the examples, there's one with params[1] as 2.3 and reward 492.25? Wait, no, in the example where params[1] was 2.3, the reward was lower. Let me check again. The example with params[1] as 2.3 had a reward of 492.25? No, the first example had params[1] as 1.3 and reward 492.25. The example with params[1] as 2.3 had a lower reward. So changing params[1] to 2.3 might not be helpful. So maybe avoid that.

Alternatively, changing params[4] from 5.3 to 6.0 (since 5.3 + 0.7 is 6.0). But the step size is 1.0. So maybe that's not allowed. Wait, the step size is 1.0, so we can only change by ±1.0. So 5.3 can be changed to 4.3 or 6.3 (but 6.3 is over 6.0, so 6.0). So changing params[4] to 6.0, and params[5] to 6.0. But in the existing examples, there's a case where params[4] and [5] are 5.3 and 5.7, and others where they are 4.3 and 4.7. So changing them to 6.0 might be a new variation.

So the new params could be:

params[0] = 5.0

params[1] = 1.3 (same as before)

params[2] = -5.0

params[3] = 5.0

params[4] = 6.0

params[5] = 6.0

params[6] = -5.0

params[7] = 5.0

params[8] = 5.0

params[9] = 5.0

This set hasn't been tried before, as per the examples given. This might be a candidate for exploration. The idea is that by adjusting some parameters from their extremes to lower values, and others to the maximum, we might find a better combination.

Alternatively, keeping params[0] at 6.0, but changing other parameters. For example, params[2] to -5.0, params[3] to 6.0 (same), params[4] to 5.3, params[5] to 6.7 (but that's over). So maybe 6.0. Then params[6] to -5.0, params[7] to 6.0, and params[8] and [9] to 5.0. That would be another set.

But I need to make sure that this hasn't been tried before. Looking through the examples, there's one where params[2] is -5, params[3] is 5, etc. So changing some to 6.0 might be new.

In any case, the key is to generate a new set of parameters that haven't been tried before, using the exploration step size of ±1.0. Based on the existing examples, the first set I proposed (params[0]=5.0, params[2]=-5.0, params[3]=5.0, params[4]=6.0, params[5]=6.0, params[6]=-5.0, params[7]=5.0, params[8]=5.0, params[9]=5.0) seems like a plausible candidate. Let's go with that.
