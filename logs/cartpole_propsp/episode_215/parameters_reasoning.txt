SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to find the global optimal policy for this cartpole environment. The goal is to balance the pole and keep the cart within its bounds, which means maximizing the reward. The reward function gives +1 every time step the pole is upright and the cart is stable.

I remember that the policy is a linear one with 18 parameters. I have some existing params from earlier training examples, like [-6.0, -4.5, 1.5, -1.0, -6.0, 1.5, -3.5, 4.5, -2.5, -2.5], which gave me a reward of 450.90. But I'm not sure if that's the best possible.

The user mentioned that the global optimum is around 500 and to explore instead of exploiting. So maybe my current params are below that threshold. I need to find higher values for some parameters but also balance others, perhaps making them less extreme if it helps the reward.

Looking at the examples provided, several have params like [-4.5, -3.5, 1.8, etc.] which seem better than my initial guess of all being around -6 or +6. For instance, one has parameters: [-3.5, -3.5, 0.8, -1.0, -4.5, 1.8, -1.5, 4.5, -2.5, -2.5] with a reward of 345.75. Another has some higher values: [-5.2, 6.0, 1.8, -1.0, -6.0, 1.8, -3.5, 4.5, -2.5, -2.5] with a reward of 94.45.

Wait, but the user says around 500 is the global optimum, and I'm at iteration 215 out of 400. Maybe my current params are below that. The examples suggest better rewards can be achieved by having some parameters higher than others. For instance, in one example, two parameters were -3.5 instead of -6, but the reward went down to 345.75. That suggests maybe not all should be pushed down.

Another point is that exploration uses a step size of 1.0 during exploration. So perhaps adding more randomness or exploring different parameter combinations could help reach higher rewards without getting stuck in local optima.

I also notice that the user mentioned parameters like [-6, -4.5, 1.5, etc.] which gave 450.90 but not the best. Other examples have some mid-range values and a couple high ones, giving around 345-397 rewards. One example even got down to 94 by having two parameters at -5.2 and 6, which might indicate that perhaps pushing some parameters higher can lead to better balance but also risk pole flipping.

So maybe the optimal policy is a combination of having some higher positive values without making others too negative. It's about finding the right balance where increasing certain parameters could improve the reward while not over-reducing them in other areas.

I should try experimenting with these different parameter sets, perhaps varying some to be higher and others lower. Maybe starting with one that has a few higher values but not too many that it negatively affects the balance. For example, if I set two middle parameters higher than their initial values, could that help? Or maybe adding more positive somewhere else.

Additionally, considering that sometimes in policy gradients, including more parameters can allow for better exploration and adaptation. So perhaps increasing the number of parameters beyond 18 is not ideal but might be necessary to find a better optimum. However, I have only 9 parameters here, so I need to carefully choose which ones to adjust.

I should also think about whether some parameters are redundant or if they can be combined with others without affecting performance. For instance, if the cart's velocity is too negative, maybe increasing it could help in balancing, but not too much that it tips over.

Another thought: since the reward depends on both pole stability and cart position, perhaps there's a sweet spot where each parameter contributes to improving the overall reward balance between these two critical aspects. Maybe I can adjust certain parameters based on how they affect either the pole or the cart.

I also need to be cautious about getting stuck in local optima. So even if my current params are around 450, maybe tweaking some parameters slightly higher and lower could yield better rewards without having a clear path to that optimum yet. That way, I can explore more possibilities within reasonable parameter ranges.

Perhaps trying out different combinations where each parameter is adjusted incrementally to see how the reward changes would help me understand which ones are most impactful. For example, increasing one parameter while keeping others constant and seeing if it increases the total reward.

In summary, my plan is to experiment with various parameter sets around what I've seen in examples, adjusting some higher than average values and others lower than average. This should give me a better chance of reaching the global optimal reward of around 500 without getting stuck in local optima.
