SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

Now you are at iteration 6 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to optimize the parameters for a linear policy in the CartPole environment. They've given a bunch of examples with different params and their corresponding rewards. The goal is to reach a high reward, ideally around 500, but the examples provided have rewards up to 127, which seems low. Wait, maybe the user made a typo? Because in the standard CartPole environment, the maximum reward is typically around 200 (since the episode length is 200 steps). Hmm, but the user says the global optimum is around 500, which is confusing. Maybe they're using a different setup or there's a misunderstanding.

Anyway, looking at the examples, the highest reward given is 127.00 for params where params[0] is -4.8, params[1] is 0.5, and others. Then, in the next example, when params[0] is -5.8, the reward drops to 120.45, but when params[2] is increased to 3.6, the reward drops further to 99.95. However, when params[1] is increased to 1.5, the reward goes up to 114.60. Then, changing params[6] from -2.3 to -1.3 gives 109.90. So maybe there's a sweet spot around params[0] being -4.8, params[1] around 0.5 to 1.5, params[2] around 2.6, params[3] 2.6, params[4] -2.6, params[5] 1.6, params[6] maybe -1.3, params[7] 3.6, params[8] -1.3, params[9] -1.1.

But the user mentioned that during exploration, the step size should be 1.0. So maybe I should perturb some of these parameters. Let's look at the current best in the examples: params[0] -4.8, params[1] 0.5, params[2] 2.6, params[3] 2.6, params[4] -2.6, params[5] 1.6, params[6] -2.3, params[7] 3.6, params[8] -1.3, params[9] -1.1 gives 127. Then, when params[0] was changed to -5.8, it dropped, but when params[2] was increased to 3.6, it dropped more. However, changing params[1] to 1.5 increased the reward. So maybe increasing params[1] from 0.5 to 1.5 is beneficial. Also, when params[6] was changed from -2.3 to -1.3, the reward decreased. So perhaps params[6] should be lower (more negative?), but in the initial example, params[6] was -2.3 and the reward was higher. Wait, in the first example with 127, params[6] is -2.3. Then when it was changed to -1.3, the reward went down. So maybe keeping params[6] lower is better.

But the user's instruction says that if we're below the global optimum (which they claim is around 500), we should explore instead of exploit. So even though the current best is 127, we need to explore more. The user also mentioned that during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So perhaps we should take the current best parameters and perturb each parameter by ±1.0 to explore new areas.

Looking at the current best parameters: params[0] is -4.8, which is already at the lower bound of -6.0 (but wait, the user said the range is [-6.0, 6.0], but the example has params[0] as -4.8. So maybe we can try increasing params[0] by 1.0 to -3.8. Similarly, params[1] is 0.5; adding 1.0 would make it 1.5, which was tried and gave 114.60. Maybe trying even higher, like 2.5? But the user said to use a step size of 1.0 during exploration, so maybe just ±1.0 from the current best.

Alternatively, maybe the current best is at params[0] -4.8, and we can try increasing it to -3.8 (since -4.8 +1.0 is -3.8). Similarly, for params[1], 0.5 +1.0 is 1.5, which was tried. But maybe also trying 0.5 -1.0 = -0.5. But the user wants exploration, so trying different directions.

But the user also said not to propose previously seen params. So need to check which ones have been tried. For example, in the first example, params[0] was -4.8, which is already used. So maybe try changing other parameters. For instance, params[2] is 2.6. Adding 1.0 would make it 3.6, which was tried and resulted in lower reward. Subtracting 1.0 would make it 1.6. Maybe that's worth trying. Similarly, params[3] is 2.6; same as params[2]. So trying 1.6 or 3.6. But since 3.6 was tried and gave lower reward, maybe try 1.6.

Alternatively, looking at params[4] which is -2.6. Adding 1.0 would make it -1.6, subtracting 1.0 would make it -3.6. Maybe trying -3.6 could be beneficial.

But since the user said to use a step size of 1.0 during exploration, and we need to try new parameters not seen before, perhaps we should take the current best (params with 127) and perturb each parameter by ±1.0, ensuring that we don't repeat previous ones.

So for example, starting with the current best:

params[0]: -4.8 (already at the lower end, so maybe increase to -3.8)
params[1]: 0.5 (can be 0.5 ±1.0 → -0.5 or 1.5)
params[2]: 2.6 (can be 1.6 or 3.6)
params[3]: 2.6 (same as above)
params[4]: -2.6 (can be -3.6 or -1.6)
params[5]: 1.6 (can be 0.6 or 2.6)
params[6]: -2.3 (can be -3.3 or -1.3)
params[7]: 3.6 (can be 2.6 or 4.6)
params[8]: -1.3 (can be -2.3 or -0.3)
params[9]: -1.1 (can be -2.1 or 0.9)

Now, looking at previous examples, some of these have been tried. For instance, params[1] = 1.5 was tried (reward 114.60). params[2] = 3.6 was tried (reward 99.95). params[4] = -3.6 hasn't been tried yet. params[5] = 0.6 hasn't been tried. params[6] = -3.3 hasn't been tried. params[7] = 4.6 hasn't been tried. params[8] = -2.3 hasn't been tried. params[9] = 0.9 hasn't been tried.

So perhaps trying some of these. For example, let's pick a few parameters to perturb:

- params[0]: -3.8 (increase by 1.0)
- params[1]: 1.5 (already tried)
- params[2]: 1.6 (decrease by 1.0)
- params[3]: 1.6 (same)
- params[4]: -3.6 (decrease by 1.0)
- params[5]: 0.6 (decrease by 1.0)
- params[6]: -3.3 (decrease by 1.0)
- params[7]: 4.6 (increase by 1.0)
- params[8]: -2.3 (decrease by 1.0)
- params[9]: 0.9 (increase by 1.0)

But since the user wants to avoid previously seen params, need to check which of these are new. For example, in the examples, when params[0] was -3.8, it wasn't mentioned. Wait, in the examples, there's a params[0]: -3.8; params[1]: 0.5; etc. which had a reward of 124.00. So maybe that's already been tried. Wait, in the examples provided, there's a line:

params[0]: -3.8; params[1]: 0.5; params[2]: 2.6; params[3]: 2.6; params[4]: -2.6; params[5]: 1.6; params[6]: -2.3; params[7]: 3.6; params[8]: -1.3; params[9]: -1.1; f(params): 124.00

So that's a different set of params with params[0] at -3.8. So maybe trying params[0] at -3.8 is already in the examples. Therefore, perhaps trying other changes.

Alternatively, let's consider changing params[4] to -3.6. Since that hasn't been tried before. Also, changing params[6] to -3.3. Let's try that.

So, a possible new set of parameters could be:

params[0]: -4.8 (same as before)
params[1]: 0.5 (same)
params[2]: 2.6 (same)
params[3]: 2.6 (same)
params[4]: -3.6 (new)
params[5]: 1.6 (same)
params[6]: -3.3 (new)
params[7]: 3.6 (same)
params[8]: -1.3 (same)
params[9]: -1.1 (same)

This way, only params[4] and params[6] are changed. Since these haven't been tried before, this might be a good exploration step. Alternatively, changing multiple parameters.

But the user might want to explore more broadly. However, given the step size of 1.0, it's better to make one or two changes. Let's go with changing params[4] to -3.6 and params[6] to -3.3. This would be a new set of parameters not previously seen.
