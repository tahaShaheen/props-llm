SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user provided several examples of params and their corresponding episodic rewards. From the examples, I notice that some params configurations give a reward of 500.00, which seems to be the maximum possible since the user mentioned that the global optimum should be around 500. However, there are also some lower rewards like 491.10 or even lower. 

Looking at the params that achieved 500.00, they have some common patterns. For instance, params[0] is 3.2, params[1] is 4.3, params[2] is 1.3, params[3] is 4.6, params[4] is -2.4, params[5] is 1.9, params[6] is -4.9 or -5.9, params[7] is -0.1, params[8] is 3.3 or 4.3, and params[9] is 4.2. 

But the user mentioned that if the current reward is below 500, we should explore instead of exploiting. However, in the given examples, there are multiple instances where the reward is exactly 500.00. The user is at iteration 6 out of 400, so there's a lot of iterations left. But the user wants to find the global optimum, which is around 500. 

Wait, the user also said that during exploration, use a search step size of 1.0. So maybe we need to perturb the parameters that are already giving 500.00 by adding or subtracting 1.0 to some of them to explore neighboring regions. 

Looking at the first example, params[6] is -4.9. If we increase it by 1.0 to -3.9, but that was already tried and gave 500.00 again. Similarly, decreasing it to -5.9 also gave 500.00. Maybe other parameters can be adjusted. 

What about params[8]? In one example, it's 3.3, and in another, 4.3. Maybe changing that by 1.0. For instance, increasing params[8] from 3.3 to 4.3 (which was already done) or decreasing it to 2.3. But since the user says not to propose previously seen params, I need to check if those have been used before. 

Wait, the user said not to propose previously seen params. So looking at the examples, the params that gave 500.00 have certain values. For example, params[6] was -4.9, -5.9, -3.9. So maybe trying -6.9 (but that's outside the range of -6.0 to 6.0). Wait, the params are in the range [-6.0, 6.0], so -6.0 is the minimum. So maybe trying -6.0 for params[6]. 

Alternatively, looking at params[7], which is -0.1. If we change that to 0.9 (adding 1.0), but that was tried in one example and gave 30.10. Not good. So perhaps that's not the direction. 

What about other parameters? Let's look at params[4], which is -2.4. Maybe changing that by 1.0 to -1.4 or -3.4. But in one example, params[4] was -3.4 and the reward was 33.00, which is much lower. So that's worse. 

What about params[5], which is 1.9. Changing that to 0.9 or 2.9. Maybe trying 2.9? But I don't know if that's been tried before. 

Alternatively, looking at params[0], which is 3.2. Adding 1.0 gives 4.2, which was tried in one example and gave 491.10. So that's worse. Subtracting 1.0 gives 2.2, which was tried and gave 33.00. Also worse. So maybe keeping params[0] at 3.2 is better. 

Similarly, params[1] is 4.3. Adding 1.0 gives 5.3, which hasn't been tried yet. Maybe that's a direction to explore. 

But the user wants to maximize the reward. Since the current examples have some params that give 500.00, but the user is at iteration 6, maybe we should explore around those parameters. 

Another thought: the user mentioned that the global optimum is around 500. So maybe the current examples are already at the maximum, but the user wants to ensure that there's no better configuration. However, since the user says that if you're below 500, you should explore. But in the given examples, there are multiple 500.00. 

Wait, but the user also said that during exploration, use a search step size of 1.0. So maybe even if we are at 500.00, we should explore by perturbing the parameters. 

So, for example, take one of the 500.00 params, like params[6] is -4.9. Let's try changing params[6] to -5.9 (which was already tried), but maybe other parameters. Let's look at params[8] which is 3.3. Changing that to 4.3 (already tried) or 2.3. Let's try 2.3. 

So, modifying params[8] from 3.3 to 2.3. Let's see if that's a new parameter. In the examples, there was a params[8] of 3.3 and 4.3, but not 2.3. So that's a new one. 

Alternatively, changing params[9] from 4.2 to 5.2 or 3.2. But 5.2 is within the range. 

But how to choose which parameter to change? Since the user wants exploration, perhaps changing one parameter by +1.0 or -1.0. Let's pick a parameter that hasn't been changed much. 

Looking at params[6], which is -4.9. Maybe changing that to -6.0 (since it's allowed). So params[6] = -6.0. 

Alternatively, changing params[7] from -0.1 to 0.9 (but that was tried and gave lower reward). 

Alternatively, changing params[8] from 3.3 to 4.3 (already tried) or 2.3. 

Alternatively, changing params[9] from 4.2 to 5.2. 

But to ensure we are exploring, maybe pick one parameter and adjust it. Let's take params[6] and set it to -6.0. That's a new value. 

So, the original params that gave 500.00 are:

params[0]: 3.2; params[1]: 4.3; params[2]: 1.3; params[3]: 4.6; params[4]: -2.4; params[5]: 1.9; params[6]: -4.9; params[7]: -0.1; params[8]: 3.3; params[9]: 4.2

Now, changing params[6] to -6.0. Let's see if that's allowed. Yes, since -6.0 is within the range. 

So the new params would be:

params[0]: 3.2; params[1]: 4.3; params[2]: 1.3; params[3]: 4.6; params[4]: -2.4; params[5]: 1.9; params[6]: -6.0; params[7]: -0.1; params[8]: 3.3; params[9]: 4.2

This is a new configuration, not seen before. 

Alternatively, changing params[8] from 3.3 to 4.3 (already tried) or 2.3. Let's try 2.3. 

Another option is to change params[7] from -0.1 to 0.9, but that was tried and gave lower reward. 

Alternatively, changing params[4] from -2.4 to -3.4 (but that was tried and gave 33.00). 

So, the best bet is to change params[6] to -6.0. Let's go with that.
