SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 395 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to improve my parameters for this cartpole environment. So, from what I understand, the goal is to balance the pole on the cart as long as possible, and the reward system is straightforward: +1 each time the pole is upright and the cart is within bounds.

Looking at the current best performing parameters, it's around 500 rewards with all params set in a way that gives that score. But I want to see if I can get higher than that. 

I remember the policy is a linear one using W and B matrices. The reward depends on whether the pole is upright and cart is stable. So, perhaps tweaking some of these parameters could give better results.

Let me think about how each parameter affects the state. The cart position (cart_position) directly impacts whether the pole can stay upright. If the cart moves too far, it might tip over or make balancing harder. So, maybe I should adjust params[0] and [2], which are related to position and velocity.

Velocity (cart_velocity) also plays a role in keeping the pole balanced. A higher negative velocity would mean the cart is moving back towards the upright position more quickly, which seems good. Maybe increasing params[1] or decreasing it could help. Also, looking at velocity's B parameter, maybe I should adjust that as well.

Pole angle (pole_angle) is a bit tricky because if it tilts too much left or right, it becomes unstable. So, perhaps the parameters in [3] and beyond related to pole angle could be adjusted here. But since W[4][0], W[5][0], etc., are for pole angular velocity, I might need to tweak those as well.

I also notice that B includes params[8] and [9]. Maybe these relate directly to pole angle and its velocity. If they're too large in magnitude, it could cause the cart to oscillate more. Perhaps reducing them slightly or adjusting based on the pole angle's current state would help.

Another thing is the interaction between position and velocity through W. Maybe there's a correlation where increasing one might affect the others negatively. So, perhaps adjusting these parameters together with their B terms to find a balance could yield better rewards.

I should also consider whether the linear policy is suited for this task. Since it's a simple reward structure, maybe a non-linear approach like neural networks would be more effective in the future, but that's not my immediate concern here.

Looking at some of the best parameters mentioned earlier, they seem to use a range from -6 to 6 with one decimal place. So I should try tweaking each parameter within these bounds without repeating any previous values as per point 2 and 3.

Let me start by adjusting params[0] (cart_position) and [1] (cart_velocity). Maybe increasing the cart's velocity could help in stabilizing it more, which would improve the reward. But I also have to be careful not to make it too high that the pole tips over. So perhaps a moderate velocity is better.

For the pole angle (pole_angle), maybe making it less extreme by adjusting params[3] and [4] could prevent it from tipping too much. Also, checking if the angular velocity of the pole is being controlled correctly would be important.

I should also consider how these parameters interact with each other in W. For example, the cart_position affecting pole angle might have a negative correlation since moving the cart affects how stable the pole is. So maybe increasing the cart's position could actually help reduce the pole's instability, which would be beneficial for the reward.

But wait, if I increase cart_position and decrease its velocity, that might bring it back towards the upright position more quickly, which seems like a good thing because it keeps the pole balanced without unnecessary movement. That sounds counterintuitive but possible in terms of dynamics.

I'm also thinking about whether the B parameters for each state are set optimally. For instance, if I increase params[8] (pole angle), would that help? Probably not directly; it's more about how the pole reacts to being tilted than just balancing itself. So maybe adjusting W's other elements might have a more direct impact.

In terms of implementation, perhaps using an adaptive tuning method like Q-learning or SARSA could be effective, but since I'm looking for a global optimizer, that's not my immediate approach here. 

I think the key is to find a balance where increasing certain parameters helps stabilize the pole without making others worse off. Maybe starting with small adjustments and seeing how it affects the reward would help. For example, increase params[0] a bit to see if the cart doesn't move too much, then adjust other parameters accordingly.

Additionally, considering the B terms for each state could provide more context on what's happening in the pole. For instance, if the pole is near its upright position with low velocity, maybe adjusting the B parameter would help in stabilizing it. Conversely, if the pole is already tilted significantly, increasing the corresponding B might aid in stabilizing it.

I should also look at the parameters for W that are directly affecting each state component. For example, params[0] affects cart_position, so perhaps making that move more towards zero (making it stabilize) could be beneficial. But if I make the cart move too much, it might cause other issues like increased pole angle velocity.

Overall, I think a good approach would involve:

1. Adjusting params[0] and [2], which influence the cart's position.
2. Modifying params[1] and others related to cart's velocity to better control its movement.
3. Fine-tuning params that affect pole angles and their velocities.
4. Being cautious with B parameters since they directly impact each state component.

By systematically tweaking these parameters while keeping them within the specified range, I aim to find a balance that maximizes the reward without causing negative effects on other aspects of the system. Starting small and testing the impact on f(params) will help guide me in making more informed adjustments.
