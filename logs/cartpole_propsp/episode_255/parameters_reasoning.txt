SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the global optimal policy for this cartpole environment using a linear policy. The user has given me some parameters and their corresponding episodic rewards. My goal is to figure out what values for params[0] through params[9] would maximize f(params).

First, I remember that the reward function gives me 1 point every time the pole stays upright and the cart is within its safe bounds. If the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds, it ends the episode with a reward of 0.

Looking at the provided parameters and rewards, there are some instances where the reward is exactly 500.00. That's quite high! Also, another instance shows a reward of 493.90, which is just slightly lower. I need to see if those higher rewards can help me understand how to adjust the parameters.

I notice that in multiple cases, params[2] and params[6] are set to values like -3 or -1.5. This might be influencing the pole's stability since a negative angle would mean the pole is inverted. Also, some parameters like 4 are set to -6, which could lead to extreme velocities (since velocity can be positive or negative). 

Wait, in other cases, params[0] and [1] seem high at 6. If I increase these, wouldn't it make the cart's position move more? But that also might cause the pole to fall over because of the high velocity if pushed too hard.

Looking at the episodes where f(params) is 500.00, which seems like a good reward, all those parameters have different combinations. For example, params[2] ranges from -3.5 to 6. When it's higher (like 6), it might be pushing the cart in one direction without causing too much motion in velocity.

But then, there are instances where f(params) drops below 500. Like in some cases, when params[8] is set to -2.5 or lower, and others with different combinations of other parameters, f decreases. So maybe having a higher reward isn't just about one parameter but balancing several.

Also, the highest reward instances seem to have both high params[0] (6) and params[1] (6). Maybe this combination helps in keeping the pole upright despite the cart being pushed hard. But if either is too low (-6), it might cause the cart to move more or the pole to fall over.

I should consider that a linear policy means each parameter contributes directly to both state variables (like velocity) and action (push left/right). So, increasing one could have an amplified effect on another. For example, if params[0] increases (polar position), it affects how much the cart moves, which in turn affects velocity.

Given that 500 is a good reward, I think the parameters should be around the ranges where the pole doesn't fall and the cart stays within bounds. But there's also the issue of exploration—how often I need to try different parameter values without getting stuck in a local maximum.

I might set each parameter between -6.0 and 6.0 with one decimal place, exploring positive and negative combinations as needed. I should balance both increasing some parameters for better pole stability but not so much that the cart's position drifts too far.

Looking at the recent parameters, which have f=170.35, these seem to be in areas where the reward is lower. That suggests that the current best parameters aren't great. So I need to explore other combinations, perhaps moving some parameters up and others down while keeping them within their ranges.

I'm thinking maybe starting with params[0] = 6, [1]=6, [2]=-3, etc., but then adjusting based on how f changes. It might require several iterations of testing different parameter values to find the sweet spot that maximizes the reward without causing the pole or cart to fail.

In summary, I should try a range of parameter values around 6 for params[0] and [1], negative values for some others, making sure not to go too extreme since that could lead to failures. The goal is to find the combination where the pole remains upright and the cart stays stable, maximizing the reward.
