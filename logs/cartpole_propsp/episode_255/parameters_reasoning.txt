SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 255 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.

WARNING: This is attempt 2 out of 10. You have FAILED 1 times already. You have 8 attempts remaining. MAKE SURE THE FORMAT IS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT: 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, ...' with all values in range [-6.0, 6.0]. If you fail again, the entire episode will be discarded.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to optimize the parameters for a linear policy in the CartPole environment. They've provided some training examples and the current iteration is 255 out of 400. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward, which they mentioned should be around 500. The previous attempts show that some parameter sets achieve 500, but others are lower.

Looking at the examples, the top-performing params have certain patterns. For instance, params[0], [1], [3], [5], [7], [8], [9] are often set to 6, 2.3, 6, 6, -6, 5, 5. However, some variations like changing params[2] from -5 to -4 or -6 led to lower rewards. Also, when params[4] was increased to 6, the reward dropped significantly. 

The user's note says that if the current reward is below 500, exploration is needed. Since the previous examples have some entries at 500, but the current iteration is 255, maybe we need to explore further. The exploration step size is 1.0, so we should consider changing some parameters by ±1.0 from the current values. 

Looking at the current top params, maybe tweaking some of the parameters that are at the extremes. For example, params[2] is -5 in many cases. Maybe trying -6 or -4? But in one case, changing params[2] to -4 led to a slight decrease. Alternatively, looking at params[6], which is -6 in most cases. What if we adjust that to -5? 

Another thing to check is params[4], which in some cases was 5.3, 6, or 4.3. The highest reward was when it was 5.3. Maybe increasing it further to 6.3 isn't allowed since the range is up to 6.0. So perhaps keeping it at 5.3. 

Also, the bias terms (params[8] and [9]) are mostly 5 or 6. Maybe increasing them to 6 could help, but in one example, when they were set to 6, the reward was 497.35, which is lower than 500. Hmm. 

Wait, the user said to explore both positive and negative values. So maybe trying some parameters that are not at the extremes. For example, params[1] is 2.3 in many cases. What if we try 1.3 or 3.3? But in one example, changing params[1] to 1.3 led to lower reward. 

Alternatively, looking at params[7], which is 6 in most cases. What if we lower it to 5? But in one case, when params[7] was 5, the reward was 479.45, which is lower. So maybe keeping it at 6. 

Another approach: look for parameters that haven't been changed much. For example, params[4] is 5.3 in some cases. Maybe trying 5.3 +1.0=6.3, but that's beyond the limit. So 6.0 is the max. But in one case, when params[4] was 6, the reward dropped. So perhaps 5.3 is better. 

Wait, the user mentioned that during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So maybe take one of the previous high-performing params and change one parameter by ±1.0. For example, take the first example with params[0]:6, params[1]:2.3, params[2]:-5, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:6, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:5, params[9]:5. Let's pick a parameter to change. Let's try changing params[2] from -5 to -6 (since it's allowed). That would be a step size of -1.0. 

So the new params would be: params[2] = -6. Let's check if that's within the range. Yes, -6 is allowed. Then, the rest remain the same. That could be a candidate. 

Alternatively, changing params[6] from -6 to -5. Let's see. But in the previous example where params[6] was -5, the reward was 498.55, which is lower than 500. So maybe not. 

Another option: change params[8] from 5 to 6. But in one case, when params[8] was 6 and params[9] was 6, the reward was 497.35. Lower than 500. So maybe not. 

Alternatively, change params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3? No, can't exceed 6.0. So 6.0. But in one case, that led to lower reward. 

Hmm. Maybe try changing params[7] from 6 to 5. But that might lower the reward. 

Alternatively, look for parameters that are not at the extremes. For example, params[1] is 2.3. Maybe try 3.3? But that's within the range. However, in the examples, when params[1] was 1.3, the reward was lower. 

Wait, the user said to explore both positive and negative values. So maybe take a parameter that's in the middle and adjust it. But given the previous examples, the high rewards are achieved with some parameters at the extremes. 

Alternatively, consider that the current best is 500.00, but maybe there's a better combination. Since the user said the global optimum is around 500, but maybe there's a way to get higher. However, the examples show that some params reach 500. So perhaps we need to explore variations of those. 

Another thought: check if any parameters are not being varied. For example, in the top examples, params[0] is always 6. Maybe trying 5 or 7 (but 7 is out of range). So 5.0. Let's try that. 

So, changing params[0] from 6 to 5. Let's see. But in one example, when params[0] was 5, the reward was 497.15. Lower than 500. So that might not be good. 

Alternatively, maybe changing params[2] from -5 to -4. But in one example, that led to 499.95, which is slightly lower than 500. Close. 

Wait, the user said that if you're below 500, explore. Since the current iteration is 255, and the previous examples have some at 500, but maybe we can find better. 

Another approach: look for parameters that have been changed in previous examples and see if adjusting them further could help. For example, in one case, params[4] was 5.3, which was part of the 500 reward. Maybe trying to increase it to 6.0, but that led to lower reward. So not. 

Alternatively, check params[6], which is -6. Maybe changing it to -5. But that led to lower reward. 

Hmm. Maybe the best approach is to take one of the existing high-performing params and make a small change. For example, take the first example where params are 6, 2.3, -5, 6, 5.3, 6, -6, 6, 5, 5. Let's change params[2] from -5 to -6 (step size of -1.0). That would be a new set of parameters. Let's try that. 

So the new params would be: params[0]:6, params[1]:2.3, params[2]:-6, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:6, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:5, params[9]:5. 

This is within the allowed range. Let's see if that could be a candidate. Alternatively, change params[2] to -4. But that was tried before and led to slightly lower reward. 

Alternatively, change params[8] or [9] from 5 to 6. But in one example, that led to lower reward. 

Alternatively, change params[7] from 6 to 5. But that might lower the reward. 

Hmm. Maybe the best exploration step is to change params[2] to -6. Let's go with that.
