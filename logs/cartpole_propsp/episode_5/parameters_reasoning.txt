SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

Now you are at iteration 5 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of training examples with different params and their corresponding episodic rewards. The goal is to find the global optimal policy, which they mentioned should be around 500. But looking at the examples, the highest reward so far is 127.00 for the params where params[0] is -4.8 and others are set in a certain way. Wait, but that's still way below 500. So maybe the user is saying that the global optimum is around 500, but the current examples haven't reached that yet.

The instruction says that during exploration, I should use a search step size of 1.0. Also, I need to avoid proposing previously seen params. The current iteration is 5 out of 400, so there's a lot more steps to go. The user probably wants me to explore more aggressively right now, since we're early in the process.

Looking at the examples, some params have high rewards. For example, the one with params[0] -4.8, params[1] 0.5, etc., gives 127.00. Then, when they changed params[0] to -5.8, the reward dropped to 120.45. But when they adjusted params[2] to 3.6, it dropped further to 99.95. However, when they increased params[1] to 1.5, the reward went up to 114.60. So maybe there's a trend here where adjusting certain parameters can increase the reward.

But since the user wants exploration with step size 1.0, perhaps I should take the previous high-performing params (like the one with -4.8, 0.5, 2.6, etc.) and perturb them by ±1.0 in some parameters. Let's look at that example again: params[0] -4.8, params[1] 0.5, params[2] 2.6, params[3] 2.6, params[4] -2.6, params[5] 1.6, params[6] -2.3, params[7] 3.6, params[8] -1.3, params[9] -1.1. The reward here was 127.00. 

Now, considering that the user wants exploration, maybe I can increase params[0] by 1.0 (from -4.8 to -3.8) and see if that leads to a better reward. Alternatively, maybe adjust params[2] or params[3] by ±1.0. Also, looking at other parameters, maybe params[8] and params[9] could be adjusted. However, the user mentioned that during exploration, we should use a step size of 1.0, so changing some parameters by that amount.

Another thing to note is that the previous example with params[0] -4.8, params[1] 0.5, etc., had a very high reward. Maybe trying to tweak other parameters around that point. For example, increasing params[1] from 0.5 to 1.5 (as in the next example) gave 114.60, which is lower. So maybe that's not the right direction. Alternatively, maybe decreasing params[1] to -0.5? But that's a step of 1.0 from 0.5 to -0.5. 

Alternatively, looking at other parameters. For instance, params[4] was -2.6. If I increase that by 1.0 to -1.6, maybe that helps. Or params[5] is 1.6; increasing to 2.6. But I need to make sure that the new params haven't been used before. The user said not to propose previously seen params. So, checking the previous examples, the one with params[0] -4.8, params[1] 0.5, etc., is unique. So, modifying that to other values not seen before.

Another approach is to look for parameters that might be contributing positively. For example, in that high-reward example, params[2] and params[3] are both 2.6. Maybe increasing them further? But the range is up to 6.0. However, the user said to use a step size of 1.0 during exploration, so maybe adding 1.0 to those. But I need to check if that's been done before. In the previous examples, there was a case where params[2] was 3.6, but that led to lower reward. So perhaps that's not the way.

Alternatively, looking at params[6] and params[7]. In the high-reward example, params[6] is -2.3 and params[7] is 3.6. Maybe adjusting those. For example, increasing params[6] by 1.0 to -1.3, or decreasing params[7] by 1.0 to 2.6. But again, need to check if those have been tried before.

Alternatively, looking at the bias terms, params[8] and params[9]. In that example, they are -1.3 and -1.1. Maybe adjusting those. For example, increasing params[8] by 1.0 to -0.3, or decreasing params[9] to -2.1. But again, need to ensure that these new params haven't been used before.

Since the user is at iteration 5, and the maximum steps are 400, this is early on, so exploration is key. The previous high reward was 127.00, but the global optimum is supposed to be around 500, so there's a lot of room for improvement. Therefore, I should generate a new set of params that are perturbed from the previous high-performing ones by 1.0 in some parameters, ensuring that they haven't been used before.

Let me pick the high-reward example: params[0] -4.8, params[1] 0.5, params[2] 2.6, params[3] 2.6, params[4] -2.6, params[5] 1.6, params[6] -2.3, params[7] 3.6, params[8] -1.3, params[9] -1.1. Now, let's perturb params[0] by +1.0 to -3.8, keeping other parameters the same. That would be a new set of params not seen before. Alternatively, perturb params[1] by +1.0 to 1.5, but that was already tried and gave lower reward. So maybe that's not the way. Alternatively, perturb params[4] from -2.6 to -1.6 (adding 1.0). Let's try that.

So, new params would be:

params[0]: -4.8 (unchanged)
params[1]: 0.5 (unchanged)
params[2]: 2.6 (unchanged)
params[3]: 2.6 (unchanged)
params[4]: -1.6 (changed from -2.6)
params[5]: 1.6 (unchanged)
params[6]: -2.3 (unchanged)
params[7]: 3.6 (unchanged)
params[8]: -1.3 (unchanged)
params[9]: -1.1 (unchanged)

This is a new set of params not seen before. Alternatively, changing params[4] to -2.6 +1.0 = -1.6. That might be a good candidate. Alternatively, changing params[5] from 1.6 to 2.6. Let's try that as well. But need to make sure not to repeat previous examples.

Alternatively, changing params[6] from -2.3 to -1.3 (adding 1.0). Let's do that. So:

params[0]: -4.8
params[1]: 0.5
params[2]: 2.6
params[3]: 2.6
params[4]: -2.6
params[5]: 1.6
params[6]: -1.3
params[7]: 3.6
params[8]: -1.3
params[9]: -1.1

This is a new set of params. Maybe this would lead to a higher reward. Alternatively, changing params[7] from 3.6 to 4.6. But I need to check if that's been done before. In the examples, there was a case where params[7] was 4.4, but not 4.6. So that's a new value.

But since the user wants exploration with step size 1.0, perhaps changing one parameter by ±1.0 from the previous high-performing example. Let's pick params[6] and increase it by 1.0 from -2.3 to -1.3. That's a step of +1.0. Let's go with that. The resulting params would be:

params[0]: -4.8
params[1]: 0.5
params[2]: 2.6
params[3]: 2.6
params[4]: -2.6
params[5]: 1.6
params[6]: -1.3
params[7]: 3.6
params[8]: -1.3
params[9]: -1.1

This is a new set of parameters, not seen before. I think this is a good candidate for exploration. Let's propose this.
</think>

params[0]: -4.8; params[1]: 0.5; params[2]: 2.6; params[3]: 2.6; params[4]: -2.6; params[5]: 1.6; params[6]: -1.3; params[7]: 3.6; params[8]: -1.3; params[9]: -1.1
