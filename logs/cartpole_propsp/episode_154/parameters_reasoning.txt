SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 154 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help someone optimize their cartpole environment using a linear policy. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward, and from the given data, it seems like around 500 reward is achievable.

First, they provided some parameters and their corresponding rewards. They mentioned that each params array is of length 10 with values in [-6.0, 6.0] and have one decimal place. The approach uses a linear policy where the action is determined by a matrix multiplication of state and parameters plus a bias term.

I notice that some parameters are negative or positive, but not all of them are following a clear trend. For instance, params[1] is -5.9, which is quite low, while others like params[0] being -4.5 also have lower values. The reward increases up to around 300 when all parameters are set in certain ways.

Since the global optimum is expected around 500, it's clear that some parameters need careful tuning. The user wants us to propose new params values aiming for higher rewards. They mentioned using a range of [-6.0, 6.0] and one decimal places.

I should consider exploring different parameter combinations, possibly focusing on those that lead to better reward outcomes. Since the current best is around 309.55 with all negative parameters in some cases, perhaps adjusting certain parameters to positive values could help increase the reward without causing instability.

Also, I should avoid repeating parameters from previous sessions and ensure diversity in exploration. Maybe trying mid-range values for each parameter that seem to perform well. For example, params[0] at 2.4, which was used in a better scenario, while keeping others slightly adjusted to prevent too many negatives or positives.

I need to be careful not to set parameters that make the system unstable, like if some parameters are too large or cause the cart to move too much without balancing properly. So, I'll aim for parameters that provide enough force when activated but also allow for gentle adjustments during training.

Finally, after proposing these params, we should evaluate how the reward changes and adjust accordingly, aiming for a higher than previous values while maintaining exploration for better parameter space coverage.
