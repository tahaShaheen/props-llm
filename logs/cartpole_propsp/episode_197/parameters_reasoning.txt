SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 197 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to optimize the parameters for a linear policy in the CartPole environment. They've given me some examples of previous parameters and their corresponding rewards. The goal is to get as close as possible to the global optimum, which they mentioned is around 500.

Looking at the examples, the highest reward so far is 500.00 with the parameters where params[0] is 6, params[1] is 2.3, params[2] is -5, params[3] is 6, params[4] is 5.3, params[5] is 6, params[6] is -6, params[7] is 6, params[8] is 5, and params[9] is 5. But there are other parameters with slightly lower rewards. 

The user mentioned that if the current reward is below 500, we should explore instead of exploiting. Since the current iteration is 197 out of 400, there's still a lot of steps left. So, maybe we need to explore the parameter space more thoroughly. 

Looking at the parameters, some of them are at the upper or lower bounds (like 6 or -6). Maybe adjusting some of these parameters by a step size of 1.0 could lead to better rewards. For example, in the first example, params[7] is 6. If we lower that by 1.0 to 5, maybe that could help. Similarly, params[8] and params[9] are 5 and 5. Increasing them to 6 might be worth trying. 

Another thing to note is that the previous examples have params[8] and params[9] varying between 5 and 6. The highest reward example has them at 5 and 5, but others have them at 6. Maybe there's a balance there. 

I should also check if any parameters are not at the extremes. For instance, params[1] is 2.3 in the highest reward case. Maybe trying 3.3 or 1.3 could explore other possibilities. But since the user said to use a step size of 1.0 during exploration, changing from 2.3 to 3.3 or 1.3 would be a step of 1.0. 

Wait, the user said during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So if we're exploring, we need to adjust parameters by ±1.0 from the current values. But which parameters to adjust? The ones that are not at the extremes. For example, params[1] is 2.3. If we add 1.0, that would be 3.3, which is within the range. Similarly, subtracting 1.0 would be 1.3. 

Looking at the previous examples, when params[1] was 3.3, the reward was lower (366.10). So maybe increasing it isn't the way. But maybe adjusting other parameters. 

Alternatively, looking at params[7], which is 6 in the highest reward. If we lower that to 5, perhaps that could lead to a better reward. Similarly, params[6] is -6, which is at the lower bound. Maybe increasing that by 1.0 to -5. 

Another approach: since the current best is 500.00, but the user says the global optimum is around 500, maybe that's already the best. However, the user's note says if you're below 500, you should explore. But here, the current example is already at 500.00. However, the user might be saying that the global optimum is around 500, but perhaps there's a way to get even higher. 

Wait, but in the examples provided, the maximum is 500.00. Maybe that's the global optimum. However, the user's instruction says that the global optimum should be around 500. So perhaps that's the maximum. However, the user might be expecting that there's a way to get higher. But according to the examples given, that's the highest. 

But the user's instruction says that if you are below that, you should explore. Since the current example is already at 500, maybe we should exploit. However, the user might have a different idea. But the user's note says that if you're below 500, you should explore. Since the current example is at 500, perhaps we can stick with that. But the user might want to check other possibilities. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a typo, and the global optimum is higher than 500. But according to the examples, 500 is the highest. So perhaps that's the best. However, the user's note says that if you're below 500, you should explore. So if we are at 500, we can stop. But the user might be expecting that there's a better parameter set. 

But given the examples, the best is already 500.00. So maybe that's the optimal. However, the user might want to check other parameters. But according to the rules, we should not propose previously seen params. The first example is already 500.00, so we can't use that again. 

Therefore, we need to explore other parameters. Let's look at the parameters in the first example and see which ones are at the extremes. For instance, params[0] is 6, params[3] is 6, params[5] is 6, params[6] is -6, params[7] is 6, params[8] is 5, params[9] is 5. 

If we adjust some of these, like lowering params[7] from 6 to 5, or increasing params[8] and params[9] to 6. Let's try that. 

So, modifying params[7] from 6 to 5, and params[8] and params[9] from 5 to 6. Let's see:

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 2.3, params[2]: -5, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 5.3, params[5]: 6, params[6]: -6, params[7]: 5, params[8]: 6, params[9]: 6. 

This would be a new parameter set, not previously seen. The step size for params[7] is -1.0, and for params[8] and [9] is +1.0. This could be a way to explore. 

Alternatively, maybe adjusting params[1] from 2.3 to 3.3 or 1.3. But since the user says to explore with step size 1.0, changing 2.3 to 3.3 would be a step of +1.0. But in the previous example where params[1] was 3.3, the reward was lower. However, maybe other parameters can be adjusted. 

Another possibility is to adjust params[6] from -6 to -5. Let's try that. 

So, params[6] is -6. Changing it to -5. That's a step of +1.0. 

But how do we decide which parameter to adjust? Since the user says to explore, perhaps trying different parameters. But since we can't know which one would lead to higher reward, we need to try different possibilities. 

Alternatively, looking at the previous examples, when params[8] and [9] were increased to 6, the reward was higher. For example, in the first example, params[8] and [9] are 5 and 5, and the reward is 500. In another example where params[8] and [9] are 6 and 6, the reward was 497.35. So that's lower. Hmm, that's conflicting. 

Wait, in the third example, params[8] and [9] are 6 and 6, and the reward is 497.35. So increasing them might not always be better. So maybe adjusting other parameters. 

Alternatively, maybe adjusting params[2] from -5 to -6. Since in the first example, params[2] is -5. Changing that to -6. Let's see. 

But this is getting a bit complicated. The key is to generate a new parameter set that hasn't been tried before, using a step size of 1.0 on some parameters. 

So, let's take the first example (params that gave 500.00) and adjust one parameter. For example, change params[7] from 6 to 5. That would be a step of -1.0. 

So the new parameters would be:

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 5; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5. 

This hasn't been seen before in the examples provided. Let's check the previous examples. The first example had params[7] as 6. So changing that to 5 would be a new set. 

Alternatively, changing params[8] from 5 to 6. Let's try that. 

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 6; params[9]: 5. 

This is different from the first example. 

But since the user said to explore, perhaps trying different combinations. However, since the user can't see my thought process, I need to generate a parameter set that's not in the previous examples and use a step size of 1.0. 

Another approach: look for parameters that are not at the extremes. For example, params[1] is 2.3, which is not at the extremes. So adjusting that by ±1.0. 

If I increase params[1] to 3.3, that's a step of +1.0. But in the example where that was done, the reward was lower. However, maybe adjusting other parameters. 

Alternatively, adjusting params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3? But wait, the range is up to 6.0. So 5.3 to 6.0 is a step of +0.7, which is less than 1.0. So maybe not. 

Alternatively, adjusting params[4] from 5.3 to 4.3 (step of -1.0). But in the second example, that was done, and the reward was 499.35. 

This is tricky. Maybe the best way is to take the current best and adjust one parameter by ±1.0. Let's pick params[7] as before. Changing from 6 to 5. 

So the new parameters would be:

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 5; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5. 

This is a valid parameter set, not seen before in the examples. Let's go with that.
