SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to find the global optimal policy for the cartpole environment using this reinforcement learning setup. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the environment is a 2D world with a pendulum on a cart. The goal is to balance the pole upright and keep the cart within certain bounds. The state includes the cart's position, velocity, pole angle, and angular velocity. The action is either pushing left (-1) or right (1). 

The policy is a linear function where the action is determined by taking a linear combination of the state variables plus some bias term B. So, action = max(state @ W + B), where W is a matrix of weights and B is a vector of biases. This setup uses 18 parameters in total for the 4-dimensional state.

The reward function gives +1 each time step if the pole is upright (angle close to -0.418 rad) and the cart's position is within [-2.4, 2.4]. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

Looking at the params array values, which are given with one decimal place between -6.0 and 6.0, I need to find the set of parameters that maximizes f(params), the episodic reward. 

The user's interaction process involves providing parameter values in chunks, exploring around the current best, and iterating until reaching a certain number of iterations. They've seen various params with different f(params) values, some above 500 and others around 420. The top performing params seem to have higher rewards when the pole is upright and cart is within bounds.

The exploration strategy uses step size 1 for searching both positive and negative parameters. This means it's likely looking in a wide range of parameter spaces, which could be efficient but might not converge quickly if the optimal point is far away.

Given that the global optimum is expected around 500 based on some of the top params, I should focus on those with higher rewards. The best known so far has f(params) = 500.00 at params[0] = 6, others vary slightly. Other top performers have similar scores but different parameter settings.

Considering the parameters' ranges and that a global optimum is desired, I'll aim for parameters that give high reward, perhaps those with higher weights on pole upright (params[2]) and cart position (params[3]). Maybe also adjusting params[0] and [1] to push towards positive values where beneficial.

I should pick parameters within their range but not too extreme. For example, setting params[0] = 6, which is the upper limit for some actions, could encourage pushing right when possible. Similarly, adjusting other parameters might help in balancing pole stability and cart position.

After thinking through these points, I'll choose parameter values around those seen as top performers but within a reasonable range to ensure convergence without over-reaching.
