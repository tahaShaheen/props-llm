SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to find the global optimal policy for this cartpole environment. The user mentioned that the current approach isn't working well, and they're looking for a better strategy.

First, I remember that in reinforcement learning, one common method to explore and exploit is through an exploration vs exploitation trade-off. Exploitation involves using what we've already learned, while exploration means trying new things to find better solutions.

The user provided some parameters for the policy, but none of them seem optimal yet. They mentioned that around 500 iterations could be needed to reach the global optimum. So, maybe a random search approach isn't efficient enough.

I think about using gradient ascent or other optimization techniques on the parameter space. But since this is a linear policy, it's possible to model it in such a way that each parameter corresponds to a coefficient in the state vector. By adjusting these coefficients during training, we can explore different policies and find one that maximizes the episodic reward.

I remember reading about adaptive exploration methods where we adjust our search strategy based on how much we've learned from each trial. This could help us spend more time exploring less promising areas while still making progress in the areas we're interested in.

Maybe I should implement an adaptive exploration method, starting with a certain step size and increasing it as we learn better. This way, initially, we might try a wide range of parameters to get a good sense of how they perform, and then gradually focus on regions where higher rewards are likely.

I also recall something about Bayesian optimization or evolutionary algorithms being used in RL for exploration. These methods use statistical models of the policy's performance to guide where to search next. Perhaps I should consider implementing one of these techniques that uses a probabilistic model to balance exploration and exploitation.

Another thought is using an epsilon-greedy approach, but since the policy is linear, it might be possible to optimize both the epsilon (exploration rate) and the specific policy weights together in each trial.

I also need to make sure that I'm not getting stuck in local optima. To do this, I can use techniques like simulated annealing or cooling down during training where the search becomes more focused on promising areas as we move towards the global optimum.

But wait, implementing all these might be a bit complex. Maybe starting with a simpler adaptive approach would work better for now. Perhaps using a step size that starts small and increases over time to explore less promising regions first before moving to larger steps where exploitation is more effective.

I should also keep track of how the reward varies across different parameter sets, adjusting my search strategy based on which parameters seem more rewarding or if certain ranges of parameters are performing well.

In summary, I think a good approach would involve systematically exploring parameter values in a way that balances initial exploration with gradual focus on promising areas. Using an adaptive step size and possibly combining it with statistical methods to guide the search could help find the global optimal policy.
