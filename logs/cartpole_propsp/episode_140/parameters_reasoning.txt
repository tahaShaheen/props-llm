SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

Now you are at iteration 140 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is working on optimizing a linear policy for the CartPole environment. The current iteration is 140 out of 400, and they need to propose new parameters that haven't been used before. The goal is to reach around 500 reward, which is the global optimum.

Looking at the examples provided, most of the top params have params[0] and params[1] set to 6 and 1.3, respectively. The other parameters like params[2], params[3], etc., vary between -6 and 6. However, the rewards are around 497, which is close to 500 but not quite there. The user mentioned that if they're below 500, they should explore more instead of exploiting.

The key here is exploration. Since the current examples are mostly exploiting the high values for params[0] and params[1], maybe trying different values for other parameters could lead to better rewards. The exploration step size is 1.0, so they should consider changing some parameters by +/-1.0 from the current values.

For example, in the first example, params[2] is -6. Maybe increasing that to -5 or even -4 could help. Similarly, params[4] and params[5] are around 5.3 and 6. Maybe adjusting those could lead to better performance. Also, the bias terms params[8] and params[9] are all 6. Maybe reducing them a bit might help.

But the user said not to propose previously seen params. So I need to make sure that the new parameters are different from all the ones listed. Let's check the existing params. For instance, in the first example, params[2] is -6, params[3] is 6, params[4] is 5.3, params[5] is 6, params[6] is -6, params[7] is 6, params[8] and [9] are 6. So maybe changing some of these. For example, changing params[2] to -5, params[3] to 5, params[4] to 4.3, etc., but ensuring that the new combination hasn't been used before.

Alternatively, maybe trying some negative values for params that are currently positive. For example, if params[3] is 6, maybe trying 5 or even lower. Also, looking at the bias terms, which are all 6. Maybe reducing them to 5 or lower.

Another approach is to look for parameters that haven't been varied much. For instance, in the examples, params[1] is always 1.3. Maybe changing that to 2.3 or 0.3. However, the user mentioned that during exploration, the step size is 1.0, so changing by 1.0 from the current value. Since params[1] is 1.3, adding or subtracting 1.0 would make it 2.3 or 0.3.

But I need to make sure that the new parameters are not in the existing examples. Let me check the existing examples again. The first example has params[0] as 6, params[1] as 1.3, params[2] as -6, params[3] as 6, etc. So maybe changing params[0] to 5 or 7 (but the max is 6), so 5. However, in some examples, params[0] is 5. So maybe changing params[1] to 0.3 or 2.3. Let's try that.

For example, set params[1] to 2.3 (adding 1.0), and see if that helps. Also, maybe changing some other parameters. Let's try:

params[0] = 6 (since it's already high in many examples)
params[1] = 2.3 (adding 1.0 to 1.3)
params[2] = -5 (instead of -6)
params[3] = 6
params[4] = 5.3
params[5] = 6
params[6] = -6
params[7] = 6
params[8] = 5
params[9] = 5

This way, we're changing params[1], params[2], and the bias terms. This combination hasn't been seen in the examples provided. Let's see if that's valid. The existing examples have params[1] as 1.3, so changing to 2.3 is a new value. Also, params[2] was -6 in some examples, but here it's -5. The bias terms are 5 instead of 6. That should be a new set of parameters.

Alternatively, maybe trying to lower some parameters that are currently high. For example, if params[5] is 6, maybe reducing it to 5. But the user said to use a step size of 1.0 during exploration. So changing by +/-1.0 from the current value. So if current value is 6, then 5 or 7 (but 7 is beyond the max of 6). So 5 is the only option.

Another possibility is to change params[4] from 5.3 to 4.3 (subtracting 1.0). But in some examples, that's already been done. For example, the fourth example has params[4] as 4.3. So that might not be new. Need to avoid that.

So, focusing on changing params that haven't been varied much. Maybe params[1] is a good candidate. Let's go with that.
