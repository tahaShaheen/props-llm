SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

Now you are at iteration 11 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is working on optimizing a linear policy for the CartPole environment. They've provided some training examples and the current iteration is 11 out of 400. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward, aiming for around 500. 

Looking at the examples, the highest reward so far is 227.55. But that's way below 500. The user mentioned that if they're below 500, they should explore more instead of exploiting. So, I need to focus on exploration here.

The current params in the top examples have some patterns. For instance, the first example has params[0] at 4, params[1] at -1.7, and others. But the rewards are still low. The user wants to avoid previously seen params, so I can't just tweak those slightly. 

Since the search step size during exploration is 1.0, I should make larger changes. Let me think about which parameters might be critical. The W matrix is 4x2, and B is 2 elements. Maybe the bias terms (params 8 and 9) are important for shifting the decision boundary. Also, the weights for the pole angle and angular velocity might need adjustment to better balance the pole.

Looking at the existing params, some of them have negative values. Maybe trying positive values for some parameters that are currently negative could help. For example, in the first example, params[2] is -4. Maybe increasing that to a positive value could affect how the cart's velocity is weighted. Similarly, params[6] is -4.9; changing that to a positive might help.

Another approach is to look for parameters that are in the middle of the range. Since the range is [-6.0, 6.0], maybe starting with some values around 0 and adjusting from there. But since exploration is needed, perhaps making larger jumps. 

Wait, the user said during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So, if a parameter is at, say, -4, adding 1.0 would make it -3, but maybe even larger steps? Wait, the step size is 1.0, so maybe each parameter is adjusted by +/-1.0 from the current value. But since the user hasn't provided a specific current param set, maybe I need to look for parameters that are not in the previous examples. 

Looking at the examples, the first few have params[0] varying from 0 to 5, but maybe trying a value like 6.0 (the upper limit) for some parameters. However, the user said the params are in the range [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place. So, possible values are like -6.0, -5.9, ..., 5.9, 6.0.

Alternatively, maybe trying to set some parameters to values that are different from the previous examples. For example, in the first example, params[0] is 4.0, but maybe trying 5.0 or 6.0. Also, looking at the bias terms (params 8 and 9), in the first example they are 1.3 and 1.8. Maybe increasing those to higher values could help.

But I need to ensure that I'm not repeating previous params. The user mentioned not to propose previously seen params. So, I should check which params have been used. For example, in the first example, params[0] is 4.0, so I shouldn't use that again. But maybe trying 6.0 for params[0]?

Alternatively, looking for parameters that are not in the existing examples. For instance, in the first example, params[2] is -4.0. Maybe trying a different value like -5.0 or -3.0. But since the step size is 1.0, maybe adding or subtracting 1.0 from existing values. However, since the user hasn't provided a specific current point, perhaps starting with a new set.

Another thought: the global optimum is around 500, which is much higher than the current examples. So, the existing params are not even close. Therefore, exploration is crucial. Maybe trying to set some parameters to extremes. For example, setting some weights to 6.0 and others to -6.0 to see if that helps.

But how to choose which parameters to change? Maybe focus on the weights for the pole angle and angular velocity, as those are critical for balancing. For instance, if the pole angle (params[4] and params[5]) are set to higher positive values, maybe that helps in stabilizing the pole.

Alternatively, looking at the previous examples, the highest reward was 227.55. Maybe that's a local maximum, and to get higher, need to explore different regions. Let me try to generate a new set of params that are different from the previous ones.

For example, let's take params[0] as 6.0 (since previous examples have up to 5.0), params[1] as 0.0 (instead of -1.7), params[2] as 6.0 (instead of -4), params[3] as -6.0 (instead of 3.1), and so on. But I need to make sure all parameters are within the range and have one decimal place.

Alternatively, maybe starting with a completely new set. Let's try:

params[0]: 6.0
params[1]: 0.0
params[2]: 6.0
params[3]: -6.0
params[4]: 6.0
params[5]: -6.0
params[6]: 6.0
params[7]: -6.0
params[8]: 6.0
params[9]: -6.0

But this might be too extreme. However, since the user said to explore with step size 1.0, maybe that's acceptable. However, this is a shot in the dark. Alternatively, looking for parameters that haven't been tried yet. For example, in the existing examples, params[8] and [9] are around 1.3 and 1.8. Maybe trying higher values, like 6.0 and -6.0 for the bias terms.

But this is just a guess. Another approach is to look at the parameters that are in the examples and try to change them by +/-1.0. For example, the first example has params[0] as 4.0. Changing that to 5.0 or 3.0. But since the user wants exploration, maybe going further, like 6.0.

Alternatively, since the user mentioned that the global optimum is around 500, which is much higher than the current examples, perhaps the current exploration is not sufficient. Therefore, trying to set parameters that are different from all previous examples.

But without knowing which parameters have been used, it's hard to avoid repetition. However, the user said not to propose previously seen params. So, I need to check the provided examples to avoid those. For example, the first example has params[0] as 4.0, so I can't use that again. But maybe using 6.0, which hasn't been used in the examples provided.

Looking through the examples, I see that in some cases, params[0] is 5, 3, 2, etc. So 6.0 is new. Similarly, other parameters might have values not seen before. Let me try to create a new set with some of these values.

For instance:

params[0]: 6.0
params[1]: -2.7 (as in one example)
params[2]: -5.0 (since previous examples have -4, -3, -5)
params[3]: 4.1 (from one example)
params[4]: 1.3 (from one example)
params[5]: -1.2 (from one example)
params[6]: -6.0 (extreme value)
params[7]: 3.2 (from one example)
params[8]: 3.0 (higher than previous examples)
params[9]: 3.0 (same as above)

But I need to ensure that all parameters are within the range and have one decimal. Also, this might be too arbitrary. Another approach is to look for parameters that are in the middle of the range, like 0.0, and try changing them.

Alternatively, considering that the reward is low, maybe the current policies are not balancing the pole effectively. The policy is a뚝

params[0]: 6.0
params[1]: 0.0
params[2]: 6.0
params[3]: -6.0
params[4]: 6.0
params[5]: -6.0
params[6]: 6.0
params[7]: -6.0
params[8]: 6.0
params[9]: -6.0
