SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to find the global optimal policy for this cartpole environment using some RL stuff. The user gave me a bunch of parameters and wants me to propose them in a certain way.

First, I need to understand the problem. The cartpole is a classic control task where you have to balance a pole on a cart without letting it fall over. The state includes the cart's position, velocity, pole angle, and angular velocity. The actions are pushing left or right with force 0 (no push) or force 1 (push). The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within bounds.

The policy here is a linear one, which means it's using weights W and B as I saw earlier. The reward is +1 each time step the pole is upright and the cart is stable. The episode ends if the pole falls or the cart goes out of bounds.

I've been told that params are 10 values with one decimal place in [-6,6]. My job is to provide them such that the episodic reward f(params) is maximized.

The user mentioned using exploration both positive and negative. So I need to try a range around -6 to 6, but not just randomly explore each number. Probably should spread out the parameters across their possible values.

They also mentioned that in the initial interaction, they'll give me some params, then propose them and see f(params). I guess I can't predict what they'll give next because it's a controlled experiment, but I can think about strategies to improve the reward function.

Looking at the provided best performing params, some are around -4.5 or higher. The rewards go up from 397.95 to 450.90 when the pole is more upright and the cart is within bounds. So a good approach might be to push the pole higher but also keep it balanced.

I should spread out the params across their possible range, maybe trying both positive and negative values for each parameter. For example, testing with some combinations of pushing left and right (params 0 and 1) while balancing the pole's angle (params 2). Also, considering the cart velocity (-inf to inf), so higher negative values in there might be useful if I can't go too far.

I should also think about the policy function. Since it's linear, increasing certain weights will make those parameters more influential. For example, params 0 and 1 (action weights) likely control the pole angle and cart velocity. Maybe try some combinations where these are positive to push left or right when needed, while negative for balancing.

Let me think about specific parameter values to test. Maybe start with both pushing actions equally: params[0] = -6, params[1] = 6 (so W has 3 rows of [-6, -4.5], etc.). That way, the action is balanced between left and right. Also, keep pole angle at around -0.418 as that's optimal.

For velocity, maybe set it to a value that helps balance—like 1.5 or 2. Perhaps try both positive and negative values so that the policy can adjust based on different conditions.

I should also consider cart position. If pushing left (-6) is too hard, maybe try -5 instead. Similarly for right (+6). Also, if pushing in one direction isn't effective, maybe try a lower force or even push more slowly with params[3] to decrease velocity impact.

Another idea: the best reward is around 450 when pole is upright and cart is stable. So balance between keeping the pole up but not letting it fall. Maybe test different combinations of the action weights for left vs right, especially focusing on pole angle—pushing in one direction more than the other could help.

I might also try some parameter sets where certain actions have higher influence to see if they improve performance beyond random guessing.

In summary, I'll spread out the parameters across their possible ranges, trying both positive and negative values for each key parameter (action weights, pole angle). This should allow me to find a policy that effectively balances the pole and keeps the cart stable.
