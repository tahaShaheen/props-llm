SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to find the global optimal policy for the cartpole environment using this given setup. The problem seems pretty involved, especially since it's about optimizing a linear policy with 18 parameters.

First, I need to understand the environment better. The cartpole is a classic RL problem where you push a pole on a cart without letting it fall over. The state includes the cart position, velocity, pole angle, and angular velocity. The goal is to keep the pole upright within bounds while keeping the cart stable. The action space has two options: pushing left (action 0) or right (action 1). The reward is positive when the pole is balanced and the cart is within a certain range.

The policy is linear, which means it's of the form action = state * W + B, where W is a matrix of parameters and B is a bias vector. Each parameter ranges from -6 to 6 with one decimal place, making 18 parameters in total. The reward function f(params) is the episodic return from applying this policy.

The user wants me to find the global optimal policy by adjusting these parameters. They'll provide specific params values each time and receive the corresponding reward. I need to adjust the params in a way that maximizes f(params).

Looking at the provided info, there are several top-performing param sets with rewards around 450-397 points. The best ones have high rewards but might not be the absolute maximum. However, they're all in the range of -6 to +6, which covers the parameter space.

Since the user wants to aim for around 500 points, which is higher than what's currently achieved by these top performers, I should consider moving towards the positive end of the parameters. But I must be cautious not to just randomly increase all parameters without considering their impact on each other and the reward function.

I need to analyze how each parameter affects the reward. For instance, params[0] (cart position) likely has a significant effect because it directly influences where the pole is being held. If I can adjust this correctly, it might balance the pole better, leading to higher rewards in the near future. Similarly, params[2] (pole angle) seems critical for maintaining the upright state.

However, increasing too many parameters might lead to overfitting or unstable behavior. I need a balanced approach where I increase certain key parameters that have a substantial impact on the reward without causing issues elsewhere.

Considering this, maybe adjusting param[0], param[2], and possibly others like param[5] (pole velocity) could be beneficial. But how much? Since the rewards are in decimal places, increasing by 1 in each might not be enough, but perhaps an incremental increase would help reach a higher reward.

I should also consider the interaction between parameters. For example, when I set a parameter to its maximum value, it affects the state transitions and thus the overall reward. Similarly, setting some parameters to their minimum or negative values could lead to different behaviors that might not be as beneficial for the reward.

Another thing to think about is whether there's any benefit in adjusting these parameters too drastically. Sometimes, small adjustments can have a larger impact due to the nature of RL, where each action leads to specific states and transitions. So, I need to find a sweet spot where increasing certain parameters doesn't make the system unstable or reduce the rewards.

Also, since the reward is episodic, I should focus on improving long-term rewards rather than just immediate ones. This might mean that increasing param[0] beyond its default value could help in balancing and keeping the pole upright over multiple steps.

In summary, to aim for a higher reward around 500, I should increase certain key parameters like cart position (param[0]) and pole angle (param[2]), possibly adjusting some others too. But I must ensure that these changes don't cause issues like instability or oscillations in the system. Testing each parameter incrementally and observing the effect on both immediate rewards and long-term performance could be a good approach.

Maybe starting with small adjustments, like increasing param[0] by 0.5 and see if the reward increases sufficiently to move towards the higher target. Then, systematically adjust other parameters as needed, perhaps in phases, while monitoring the results.
