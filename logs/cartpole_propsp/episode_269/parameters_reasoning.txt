SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 269 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.

LLM:

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to maximize the episodic reward f(params) for the cartpole environment using a linear policy. The current best params I've seen give around 500 points, but I know that's just local and I need to find the global optimum.

Hmm, first step is to explore different params values. Since they're in the range of -6.0 to 6.0 with one decimal place, I can vary each parameter from this range. But how do I ensure I'm not repeating previous examples?

I remember that during exploration, I should use a search step size of 1.0 for the parameters. So maybe I can start by increasing some of them and decreasing others to see if it improves f(params).

Wait, let me think about the linear policy structure. The action is determined by state @ W + B, where W is a matrix with specific weights, and B are the biases. Changing these would change the policy's behavior.

I should probably try perturbing each parameter individually. For example, start by increasing params[0] from 6 to 5.9, then to 5.8, etc., while keeping others constant, and see how f(params) changes. That way, I can understand which parameters are most influential on the reward.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to spread out the changes across multiple parameters since some might be more critical than others. Maybe a grid search approach where I vary each parameter in small increments and note down the best f(params).

Also, considering that the global optimum is around 500 points, if my current setup isn't reaching that, I need to explore regions of params that aren't covered yet. Maybe even beyond the top performers mentioned.

But wait, how do I ensure I'm not just searching randomly? It might help to have some systematic way of varying the parameters. Maybe using a method like gradient ascent but since it's a linear policy, perhaps I can compute gradients analytically and adjust accordingly. But that might be too advanced for me right now.

Alternatively, maybe I can use a simple hill-climbing algorithm where I adjust each parameter based on how much f(params) increases when I change them slightly. That could guide me towards higher reward regions more efficiently.

Another thought: since the rewards depend on keeping the pole upright and cart within bounds, certain parameters like W[0][2] (pole angle) and W[0][3] (angular velocity) might be crucial for balancing. So maybe increasing these or adjusting them in a certain way could help maintain the pole upright.

I should also consider how the state transitions affect the reward. The cart's position and velocity determine if it's out of bounds, which ends the episode. So keeping those within the -2.4 to 2.4 range is important.

Maybe I can set some parameters to higher values when the cart is near the center to encourage more pushes, and lower them otherwise. That could help in balancing the pole better.

But without knowing exactly how each parameter affects f(params), it's a bit tricky. I might need to try several different combinations, perhaps starting with the top performers and then moving inward if they don't yield higher rewards.

I also wonder if there's a way to quantify which parameters contribute more to the reward. Maybe by computing partial derivatives of f(params) with respect to each parameter, I could prioritize adjusting those first in my exploration strategy.

Overall, it seems like a combination of systematic parameter variation and some analysis would be necessary. I'll need to try multiple approaches, perhaps combine different strategies, and keep track of which param settings give the best rewards to guide further exploration.
