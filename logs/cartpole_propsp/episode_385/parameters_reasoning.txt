SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 385 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help someone find the global optimal policy for the cartpole environment using a linear policy. The user has provided some parameters and wants me to generate new ones. 

First, I remember that the policy is a linear function where action is determined by state multiplied by weights plus bias terms. So each parameter in params corresponds to an action value based on the state.

The goal is around 500, which seems like a high reward because balancing the pole is tricky. The user's parameters are pretty good at getting close, especially the first two and last few parameters. 

I need to propose new params values with decimals and within [-6.0, 6.0]. I should aim for a similar or higher reward without repeating previous ones. Maybe tweak some middle parameters to see how it affects.

Let me think about the state: cart position, velocity, pole angle, angular velocity. Pushing in both directions could help, but maybe balancing between -3 and +4? Also, the angle needs to stay within -0.418 radians. 

I'll try increasing some angles or pushing in both directions more. For example, params[2] might be higher so pole is less likely to fall. Maybe params[4] can be increased to push harder on right side. Also, reduceparams[6], pole angle, to make it stay upright.

Let me try a combination where middle parameters are pushed and extremes aren't too far from before. So maybe params around -5.9 for position, 7 for velocity (strong right push), high pole angle (-3.5) but not too much, etc.
