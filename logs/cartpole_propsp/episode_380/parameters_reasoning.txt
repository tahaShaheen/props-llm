SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.
--- TOP 3 BEST PERFORMING PARAMS ---
params[0]: 6; params[1]: 6; params[2]: -3; params[3]: 6; params[4]: -6; params[5]: 1.8; params[6]: -3.5; params[7]: 4.5; params[8]: -2.5; params[9]: -2.5; f(params): 500.00

params[0]: -6; params[1]: -4.5; params[2]: 3; params[3]: 6; params[4]: -6; params[5]: 1.8; params[6]: -3.5; params[7]: 4.5; params[8]: -2.5; params[9]: -2.5; f(params): 500.00
--- MOST RECENT 3 PARAMS ---
params[0]: 6; params[1]: 7; params[2]: -3.4; params[3]: 7; params[4]: 1.7; params[5]: 1.7; params[6]: -3.5; params[7]: 4.5; params[8]: -2.6; params[9]: -2.6; f(params): 45.45
params[0]: 6; params[1]: 7; params[2]: -3.5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: -6; params[5]: 1.8; params[6]: -3.5; params[7]: 4.5; params[8]: -2.6; params[9]: -2.6; f(params): 500.00
params[0]: 6; params[1]: -4.5; params[2]: 3; params[3]: 7; params[4]: -6; params[5]: 1.8; params[6]: -3.5; params[7]: 4.5; params[8]: -2.5; params[9]: -2.5; f(params): 152.15


Now you are at iteration 380 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the optimal parameters for this cartpole environment. The goal is to balance the pole and get it upright while keeping the cart in a safe position. The policy is linear, which means it's defined by a 18-parameter vector (since each action has two parameters). 

First, looking at the examples provided, I see that when certain params are set, the function value f(params) reaches 500 or just below. For instance, in one of the top performing params, all f=params are around -6 to +6 with one decimal place. The f value is exactly 500, which is the highest noted.

Since the global optimum is mentioned as around 500, I should focus on achieving higher than that. Maybe pushing some parameters slightly above their current ranges could help. Let's see: if I set params[0] to 6 and others in a way that aligns with previous successful setups, perhaps the f value will improve.

Wait, but the user wants specific params values. They provided examples where certain combinations give high f. So maybe tweaking other parameters besides the highest ones could help. Maybe increasing some action space parameters?

Alternatively, considering the policy's structure: each state is [position, velocity, angle, angular velocity], and actions are either -1 or 1 (left or right). The linear model has W as a 4x5 matrix for actions, meaning W[0][0] affects the first action, etc. 

If I increase some weights in W that contribute positively to keeping the pole upright and cart within bounds, maybe f will go up. But without knowing which specific parameters are most impactful, it's tricky.

Another angle: perhaps adjusting params[0], [2], or others based on successful setups. For instance, in one of the top examples, params[0] is 6, while another has -6. So maybe a balance around that range could be optimal.

Given the user's interaction history, they want to increase f by setting higher params, so focusing on increasing some key parameters could help reach above 500. Maybe adjusting certain W elements or B values slightly could improve the reward without too much strain.

I think I'll set params[0], [1], and others in a range around -6 to +6, perhaps even pushing some higher than before. Let's see: params[0] =6, [1]=6, maybe [2]=-3, but adjust other elements for better balance.
