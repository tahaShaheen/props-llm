SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 289 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to optimize the parameters for a linear policy in the CartPole environment. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward, which they mentioned should be around 500. The current examples show that some parameter sets are achieving 500, but others are lower. The user is at iteration 289 out of 400, so there's still time to explore.

Looking at the provided examples, the top-performing parameters have certain patterns. For instance, params[0], [1], [3], [4], [5], [7], [8], [9] are often set to 6, 5.3, 6, etc. However, some variations like params[2] being -5 or -4, and params[6] being -6 or -5, seem to affect the reward. The ones with lower rewards have parameters outside the optimal range, like params[2] at -6 or params[7] at 5 instead of 6.

Since the user mentioned that exploration is needed if the current reward is below 500, but here we have some examples hitting exactly 500. However, the instruction says that the global optimum should be around 500, so maybe there's a way to get even higher. Wait, but the examples given already have some at 500.00, which might be the maximum possible. However, the user says that if you're below 500, you should explore. But in this case, the examples are already at 500. So maybe the next step is to slightly perturb the parameters to see if we can get higher, but the user's note says that the global optimum should be around 500. So maybe the best we can do is 500, and the current examples are already at that. However, the user might be expecting us to explore further.

Wait, but the user's instruction says that if you're below 500, you should explore. If the current examples are at 500, then maybe we should exploit. However, the user might be suggesting that even if you're at 500, there's a chance to find a better one. But the problem is that the examples provided already have some at 500.00, which might be the maximum. However, the user's note says that the global optimum is around 500, so perhaps the best possible is 500. So maybe the current parameters are already optimal. But the user's instruction says that if you are below that, you should explore. Since in the examples, some are at 500.00, which is the target, maybe the next step is to check if there's a way to get higher. But perhaps the maximum is indeed 500, and the user is just trying to confirm that.

Alternatively, maybe the user is expecting us to look for variations that could slightly improve the reward. However, since the examples already have multiple instances of 500.00, perhaps the optimal is already found. But the user's instruction says that the global optimum should be around 500, so maybe the current parameters are already at the optimal. However, the user might want to explore further to confirm. But given that the user is at iteration 289, and there are 111 more iterations left, perhaps a small exploration step is needed.

Looking at the parameters that achieved 500.00, they have params[0] = 6, params[1] = 2.3, params[2] = -5, params[3] = 6, params[4] = 5.3, params[5] = 6, params[6] = -6, params[7] = 6, params[8] = 5, params[9] = 5. Maybe changing one of the parameters slightly, like increasing params[1] from 2.3 to 3.3 (but in the examples, that led to lower rewards). Alternatively, changing params[4] from 5.3 to 6, but in one example, that led to 436.00. So that's worse. Alternatively, maybe adjusting params[6] from -6 to -5. But in one example, that led to 498.55, which is lower than 500. So perhaps the current parameters are already optimal.

But the user's instruction says that during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So maybe we should perturb one of the parameters by 1.0. For example, taking the best parameter set (params[0] to [9] as mentioned) and changing one parameter. Let's pick a parameter that's at the edge of the range. For example, params[0] is 6.0, which is the maximum. If we decrease it by 1.0 to 5.0, but that might lower the reward. Alternatively, params[2] is -5.0. If we increase it by 1.0 to -4.0, but in the examples, that led to 499.95, which is slightly lower. Alternatively, maybe changing params[8] from 5.0 to 6.0. Let's try that. So, changing params[8] from 5 to 6, keeping others the same. That would be a new parameter set. Let's check if that's not already in the examples. The examples have params[8] as 5 in the 500.00 cases. So changing that to 6 might be a new parameter set. However, the user's instruction says not to propose previously seen params. So if that's a new one, it's okay. Alternatively, maybe changing params[7] from 6 to 5. But in one example, that led to 485.40, which is lower. So perhaps that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe changing params[3] from 6 to 5. But that's in the examples and led to lower rewards. So perhaps the best approach is to take the best parameters and slightly perturb one of the parameters that are in the middle of the range. For example, params[1] is 2.3. If we increase it by 1.0 to 3.3, but in the examples, that led to 373.90, which is worse. So that's not helpful. Alternatively, decrease it by 1.0 to 1.3. Let's see. That might be a new parameter set. But again, the user's instruction says to explore with step size 1.0. So perhaps trying that. However, since the user is at iteration 289, and there are still many steps left, maybe a small exploration is needed.

Alternatively, considering that the current best is 500.00, and the user says the global optimum is around 500, maybe the best is already found, and we can just repeat the same parameters. But the user says not to propose previously seen params. So we need to generate a new set. However, the user might be expecting us to explore further. But given that the examples already have some at 500, perhaps the maximum is achieved. However, the user's note says that the global optimum should be around 500, so maybe the current parameters are already optimal. Therefore, perhaps the best approach is to slightly perturb one parameter to check if a higher reward is possible, even though the examples have 500.00.

But how to choose which parameter to perturb? Let's look at the parameters that are in the middle of the range. For example, params[1] is 2.3. If we increase it by 1.0 to 3.3, but that led to lower rewards. Alternatively, decrease it by 1.0 to 1.3. Maybe that's a new parameter. Alternatively, params[4] is 5.3. If we increase it by 1.0 to 6.3, but that's beyond the allowed range of [-6.0, 6.0]. Wait, the parameters are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], so 6.3 is invalid. So we can't do that. Similarly, decreasing params[4] by 1.0 to 4.3. In one example, that led to 499.35, which is slightly lower than 500. So that's not helpful.

Another parameter is params[8] at 5.0. Increasing it by 1.0 to 6.0. Let's try that. So the new parameters would be:

params[0]: 6.0, params[1]: 2.3, params[2]: -5.0, params[3]: 6.0, params[4]: 5.3, params[5]: 6.0, params[6]: -6.0, params[7]: 6.0, params[8]: 6.0, params[9]: 5.0. This is a new parameter set not seen before. Let's check if this is allowed. All parameters are within [-6.0, 6.0], and have one decimal place. So yes. This might be a candidate for exploration.
