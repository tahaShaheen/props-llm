SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants me to find the optimal parameters for the CartPole environment using a linear policy. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward, which they mentioned should be around 500. The current examples provided have rewards up to 92.25, which is way below 500. So, there's a lot of room for improvement.

First, I need to understand the structure of the parameters. The policy is a linear function where each state variable (cart position, velocity, pole angle, angular velocity) is multiplied by a weight matrix W and then added to a bias B. The action is chosen by taking the argmax of these values. Since the action space is binary (left or right), the weights and biases need to be set such that the policy can effectively balance the pole.

Looking at the existing examples, some have higher rewards than others. The top one is 92.25 with params[0] 0, params[1] -1.7, etc. But even that is low. The user mentioned that if the reward is below 500, it's a local optimum, and we need to explore more.

The exploration step size is 1.0, so I should consider perturbing the parameters by ±1.0 from the current best or other examples. However, I need to ensure that the parameters stay within [-6.0, 6.0] and have one decimal place. Also, the user said not to propose previously seen params.

Let me check the existing params to avoid repetition. The first example has params[0] 0, [1] -1.7, [2] -4, etc. The second has [0] 1, [1] -0.7, etc. The third is [-1, -2.7, -5, ...]. So, the idea is to explore new regions.

Since the reward is low, maybe the current parameters aren't effectively balancing the pole. The policy might not be reacting correctly to the state variables. For instance, the weights for the pole angle and angular velocity might be too low. Maybe increasing the weights for these terms could help the policy respond more aggressively to changes in the pole's position.

Alternatively, the bias terms might be too low, leading to incorrect action choices. Let's think about the structure. The action is argmax(state @ W + B). So, the bias terms B (params[8] and [9]) influence the decision when the state variables are zero. If the bias is too low, the policy might default to one action even when it's not appropriate.

Another thought: the current examples have some negative values. Maybe exploring both positive and negative values for the weights could lead to better performance. For example, if the cart is moving left, the policy might need to push right, which could be captured by certain weight signs.

Let me try to generate a new set of parameters. Starting from the first example, which had a reward of 92.25. Let's take that as a base and perturb some parameters. For instance, increasing params[3] (which was 3.1) by 1.0 to 4.1. Also, maybe adjusting the bias terms. But I need to ensure that I don't repeat any of the existing examples.

Wait, the user said to use a search step size of 1.0 during exploration. So, for each parameter, I can add or subtract 1.0 from the current value. But since the parameters are in [-6.0, 6.0], I need to stay within that range.

Let me pick a parameter from the first example. For instance, params[0] is 0. If I add 1.0, it becomes 1.0. But that's already in the second example. So, maybe subtract 1.0 to get -1.0. But that's in the third example. Hmm. Maybe perturb other parameters.

Looking at the first example's params[2] is -4.0. Adding 1.0 would make it -3.0, which is in the second example. Subtracting 1.0 would be -5.0, which is in the third example. Not helpful.

Alternatively, let's take a parameter that's not in the examples. Let's look at params[4] in the first example: 0.3. Adding 1.0 would be 1.3, which is in the second example. Subtracting 1.0 would be -0.7, which is in the third example. Hmm.

Maybe try a different approach. Since the reward is low, perhaps the parameters need to be more aggressive. For example, increasing the weights for the pole angle and angular velocity. Let's say, set params[4] (which is for pole angle) to a higher value. Suppose in the first example, params[4] is 0.3. Let's increase that to 1.3 (adding 1.0). Similarly, params[6] is -4.9. Adding 1.0 would be -3.9, which is in the second example. Maybe subtract 1.0 to get -5.9, but that's in the third example. Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe start from scratch. Let's consider that the policy needs to balance the pole. The pole angle (params[2] and [3]) and angular velocity (params[6] and [7]) are critical. If the pole is leaning to the right (positive angle), the cart should move right to balance it. So, the weight for the pole angle should be positive when the action is to move right. Wait, the action is determined by the maximum of the two linear combinations. So, if the weight for the pole angle in the right action is higher, that would be preferred when the angle is positive.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for parameters that are not in the existing examples. For example, the first example has params[0] 0, [1] -1.7, [2] -4, [3] 3.1, etc. Let's try changing some parameters by 1.0. For instance, params[0] 0.0 +1.0 = 1.0 (already in second example), so maybe -1.0. But that's in the third example. Hmm.

Alternatively, look at other parameters. Let's take params[8] and [9] (the bias terms). In the first example, they are 1.3 and 1.8. If I increase them by 1.0, that would be 2.3 and 2.8, which is in the second example. So that's already there. Maybe decrease them by 1.0 to 0.3 and 0.8, which is in the third example. So again, existing.

This is tricky. Maybe the best approach is to take one of the existing examples and perturb a parameter that's not in the examples. For example, take the first example and change params[5] from -2.2 to -2.2 +1.0 = -1.2 (which is in the second example). No, that's already there. Or subtract 1.0 to -3.2, which is in the third example.

Wait, maybe take the first example and change params[7] from 2.2 to 3.2 (adding 1.0). That's in the second example. So that's already present. Hmm.

Alternatively, take the third example and adjust another parameter. The third example has params[0] -1, [1] -2.7, [2] -5, [3] 2.1, [4] -0.7, [5] -3.2, [6] -5.9, [7] 1.2, [8] 0.3, [9] 0.8. Let's perturb params[3] from 2.1 to 3.1 (adding 1.0). That's in the first example. Not helpful.

This is really challenging. Maybe the user's examples are limited, and I need to explore new combinations. Since the exploration step is 1.0, perhaps start with all zeros and then adjust. But that's not in the examples. Let me try that.

Let's create a new set of parameters. For example:

params[0] = 0.0 (from first example), but maybe adjust others. Let's say:

params[0] = 0.0
params[1] = -1.7 (from first example)
params[2] = -4.0 (from first example)
params[3] = 3.1 (from first example)
params[4] = 0.3 +1.0 = 1.3 (from second example)
params[5] = -1.2 (from second example)
params[6] = -3.9 (from second example)
params[7] = 3.2 (from second example)
params[8] = 2.3 (from second example)
params[9] = 2.8 (from second example)

Wait, that's the second example. So that's already there. Not helpful.

Alternatively, take the first example and change one parameter by 1.0. Let's say params[0] is 0.0, but change params[4] to 0.3 +1.0 =1.3. That's in the second example. So again, existing.

Maybe I need to take a different approach. Let's think about the CartPole problem. The key is to move the cart in the direction that stabilizes the pole. If the pole is leaning to the right (positive angle), the cart should move right. So, the weight for the pole angle in the right action should be positive. Similarly, if the pole is moving downward (positive angular velocity), the cart should move in the opposite direction. So, the weight for angular velocity in the right action should be negative.

Assuming that the right action is represented by the second element in the argmax (since it's a binary choice), then the weights for the right action should be set such that when the pole is leaning right, the value is higher. Let's assume that the right action is the second element. So, for the right action, the weights for the pole angle (params[3]) and angular velocity (params[7]) should be positive and negative, respectively. Wait, this is getting too specific without knowing the exact structure of the policy.

Alternatively, maybe the weights should be such that when the pole is leaning to the right, the right action is chosen. So, if the pole angle is positive, the right action's value should be higher. That would require that the weight for the pole angle in the right action is positive. Similarly, if the angular velocity is positive (pole moving downward), the right action should be chosen to counteract that, so maybe the weight for angular velocity in the right action is negative.

But since the policy is a linear combination, the exact weights depend on how the features are combined. This is getting too complex without more information. Maybe I should just generate a new set of parameters that are not in the existing examples by perturbing some values.

Looking at the existing examples, the first one has params[0] 0, [1] -1.7, [2] -4, [3] 3.1, [4] 0.3, [5] -2.2, [6] -4.9, [7] 2.2, [8] 1.3, [9] 1.8.

Let's try changing params[6] from -4.9 to -3.9 (adding 1.0). That's in the second example. So not helpful. How about changing params[6] to -5.9 (subtracting 1.0)? That's in the third example.

Alternatively, change params[4] from 0.3 to 1.3 (adding 1.0). That's in the second example. Hmm.

Wait, the user said to avoid previously seen parameters. So maybe I need to look for parameters that are not in any of the examples. Let's check the first example's params again. Are there any parameters that are unique? For example, the first example's params[5] is -2.2. The second example's is -1.2. The third example's is -3.2. So maybe trying a value that's not in any of these. For example, -2.2 + 1.0 = -1.2 (second example), or -2.2 -1.0 = -3.2 (third example). So no new values there.

This is really tough. Maybe I should take one of the examples and change a parameter that's not in the examples. For instance, take the first example and change params[7] from 2.2 to 3.2 (which is in the second example). No. How about changing it to 1.2? That's in the third example. Not helpful.

Alternatively, take the first example and change params[8] from 1.3 to 0.3 (third example) or 2.3 (second example). No.

Wait, maybe the user's examples are limited, and I need to generate a completely new set. Let's try that. For example:

params[0] = 0.0
params[1] = -1.7
params[2] = -4.0
params[3] = 3.1
params[4] = 1.3 (from adding 1.0 to 0.3)
params[5] = -1.2 (from adding 1.0 to -2.2)
params[6] = -3.9 (from adding 1.0 to -4.9)
params[7] = 3.2 (from adding 1.0 to 2.2)
params[8] = 2.3 (from adding 1.0 to 1.3)
params[9] = 2.8 (from adding 1.0 to 1.8)

But this is the second example. So that's already there. Not helpful.

This is really challenging. Maybe the user's examples are the only ones available, and I need to find a way to generate a new set. Perhaps by changing multiple parameters. For example, take the first example and increase params[3] by 1.0 (3.1 +1.0 =4.1), and decrease params[2] by 1.0 (-4.0 -1.0 = -5.0). So:

params[0] = 0.0
params[1] = -1.7
params[2] = -5.0
params[3] = 4.1
params[4] = 0.3
params[5] = -2.2
params[6] = -4.9
params[7] = 2.2
params[8] = 1.3
params[9] = 1.8

This set isn't in the examples. Let's check. The third example has params[2] = -5.0, params[3] =2.1. So here, params[3] is 4.1, which is different. So this could be a new set. Let's see if this is valid.

This is a new combination. So I can propose this as a possible candidate. The idea is to increase the weight for the pole angle (params[3]) and decrease the weight for the pole angle in the other term (params[2]).

Alternatively, maybe this is not the right approach. But given the time constraints, I'll proceed with this and hope it's not in the examples.
