SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. I need to find the optimal parameters for the cartpole environment. The user provided some examples and their corresponding rewards. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward, which they mentioned should be around 500. The current best from the examples is 428.05, but that's still below 500. So, I need to explore more.

Looking at the examples, most of the high-reward params have params[0], [1], [3], [6], [7], [8], [9] set to 6 or 5, while some others are negative like params[2] and [6]. The parameters that are lower (like params[2], [6]) might be important for balancing the pole. 

The user mentioned that during exploration, I should use a step size of 1.0. So, maybe I should perturb the existing parameters by adding or subtracting 1.0 to some of them. For example, in the first example, params[2] is -3. Maybe increasing that to -2 or -4 could help. Similarly, params[6] is -6; changing that to -5 or -7 (but wait, the range is [-6.0, 6.0], so -7 is invalid). So maybe -5 or -6. But since the current value is -6, maybe trying -5. 

Wait, the user said to search both positive and negative values. So perhaps adjusting some parameters that are at the extremes. For instance, in the first example, params[0] is 6. Maybe reducing that to 5. But I need to make sure that I don't repeat previous params. 

Looking at the previous examples, the top ones have params[0] as 6, params[1] as 1.3, params[2] as -3, params[3] as 6, params[4] as 5.3, params[5] as 2.7, params[6] as -6, params[7] as 6, params[8] and [9] as 6. So maybe varying params[4], [5], or [2], [6] to see if that can lead to higher rewards. 

For example, in the first example, params[4] is 5.3. If I increase that to 6.3 (but wait, the max is 6.0). So maybe 6.0. Similarly, params[5] is 2.7; increasing that to 3.7 or 4.7. But the examples show that when params[5] was 3.7, the reward was lower (426.55). Hmm, so maybe that's not the direction. 

Alternatively, maybe adjusting params[2] from -3 to -4. In one of the examples, params[2] was -4 and the reward was 398.45, which is lower than the 428. So that might not be helpful. 

Wait, the user said that the global optimum should be around 500, so the current examples are below that. So perhaps the existing parameters are in a local optimum. To escape that, I need to explore more. 

Maybe trying to change some parameters that are currently at 6.0 to lower values. For instance, params[0] is 6.0. If I reduce that to 5.0, but then again, maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, changing params[3] from 6 to 5. 

Alternatively, looking at params[6], which is -6.0. Maybe changing that to -5.0. In one example, when params[6] was -5, the reward was lower. But maybe combining that with other changes. 

Another approach is to look for parameters that haven't been tried much. For example, in the examples, params[4] is mostly around 5.3 or 6.0. Maybe trying a lower value, like 4.3. But in one example, that was tried with lower rewards. 

Alternatively, looking at params[5], which is 2.7. Maybe increasing that to 3.7, but that was tried and gave lower reward. 

Hmm. Maybe trying to adjust params[8] and [9], which are currently at 6.0. Maybe reducing them to 5.0. But in one example, when they were 5, the reward was lower. 

Alternatively, trying to change some other parameters. For example, in the first example, params[2] is -3. Let's try changing that to -2. But that was already tried in one example (params[2]: -2, reward 404.95). 

Wait, the user said not to propose previously seen params. So I need to make sure that the new parameters haven't been in the examples provided. 

Looking through the examples, the most recent ones have params[0] as 6, [1] as 1.3, [2] as -3, [3] as 6, [4] as 5.3, [5] as 2.7, [6] as -6, [7] as 6, [8] and [9] as 6. So maybe changing one of the parameters that's in the middle. 

For example, changing params[4] from 5.3 to 6.0. But in one example, when params[4] was 6, the reward was 379.45, which is lower. So that might not be helpful. 

Alternatively, changing params[5] from 2.7 to 3.7. But that was tried and gave lower reward. 

Hmm. Maybe trying to vary params[2] from -3 to -4, but that was tried and gave lower reward. 

Alternatively, changing params[6] from -6 to -5. But in one example, when params[6] was -5, the reward was lower. 

Wait, maybe I should look for parameters that are not at the extremes. For example, in the examples, params[1] is 1.3, which is not at the max. Maybe increasing that to 2.3 or 0.3. But in some examples, that was tried. 

Alternatively, changing params[7] from 6 to 5. But that was not tried in the examples. 

So, perhaps trying a new parameter set where params[7] is 5 instead of 6. Let's try that. 

Let me draft a new set of parameters. Let's take the first example and change params[7] from 6 to 5. So:

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 1.3, params[2]: -3, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 5.3, params[5]: 2.7, params[6]: -6, params[7]: 5, params[8]: 6, params[9]: 6. 

This hasn't been tried before. Let's check the examples. The previous examples have params[7] as 6 or 5.2 in one case. So this is a new combination. 

Another idea: maybe changing params[6] from -6 to -5. So:

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 1.3, params[2]: -3, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 5.3, params[5]: 2.7, params[6]: -5, params[7]: 6, params[8]: 6, params[9]: 6. 

But in one example, that was tried with reward 398.00. So that's already in the examples. So I can't use that. 

Alternatively, changing params[4] from 5.3 to 4.3. But that was tried in one example (params[4]: 4.3, reward 398.45). 

Hmm. Maybe trying to change multiple parameters. For example, decrease params[0] from 6 to 5, and increase params[2] from -3 to -2. But that was tried in one example (params[0]: 5, params[2]: -2, reward 397.95). 

Alternatively, changing params[8] and [9] from 6 to 5. But that was tried in some examples. 

Wait, the user said to explore with step size 1.0. So, maybe take one of the existing high-reward parameters and perturb one parameter by +1 or -1. For example, take the first example (params[0] to [9] as in the first example) and change params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3 (but that's over the max of 6.0). So 6.0. Let's try that. 

So new params would be:

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 1.3, params[2]: -3, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 6.0, params[5]: 2.7, params[6]: -6, params[กล่าวว่า]: 6, params[8]: 6, params[9]: 6. 

But in one example, when params[4] was 6.0, the reward was 379.45. That's lower. So that might not help. 

Another approach: looking for parameters that are in the middle. For example, in the first example, params[5] is 2.7. Maybe increasing that to 3.7, but that was tried and gave lower reward. 

Alternatively, trying to change params[2] from -3 to -4. But that was tried with lower reward. 

Hmm. This is tricky. Since the current examples are below 500, maybe the optimal parameters are in a different region. Maybe trying some more aggressive changes. For example, setting params[2] to -4.5, but that's not allowed as parameters must be in steps of 1.0? Wait, the user said during exploration to use step size 1.0, but the parameters can be any value within [-6.0, 6.0]. So maybe changing params[2] from -3 to -4 (which is a step of -1.0). 

But that was tried in one example and gave lower reward. 

Alternatively, maybe changing params[6] from -6 to -5, but that was tried. 

Wait, perhaps changing multiple parameters. For example, take the first example and change params[2] from -3 to -2 and params[6] from -6 to -5. Let's see:

params[0]:6, params[1]:1.3, params[2]:-2, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:2.7, params[6]:-5, params[7]:6, params[8]:6, params[9]:6. 

This hasn't been tried before. Let's check the examples. In one example, params[2] was -2 and params[6] was -5. But in that case, the reward was 398.00. So that's lower. 

Alternatively, changing params[2] to -3.5? No, the step size is 1.0, so only integers. 

Wait, the parameters can be any real numbers, but the user said to use a step size of 1.0 during exploration. So, for example, if a parameter is at 5.3, adding or subtracting 1.0 would take it to 6.3 or 4.3. But since the max is 6.0, 6.3 is invalid. So, maybe adjusting to 6.0. 

But in the examples, that was tried with lower rewards. 

This is challenging. Maybe I should look for parameters that are not in the current examples. For example, changing params[1] from 1.3 to 2.3 or 0.3. Let's try changing params[1] to 2.3. So:

params[0]:6, params[1]:2.3, params[2]:-3, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:2.7, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:6, params[9]:6. 

This hasn't been tried before. Let's check the examples. The previous examples have params[1] as 1.3 or 0.3. So this is a new combination. 

Alternatively, changing params[1] to 0.3. That was tried in one example (params[1]:0.3, reward 398.45). 

So, trying params[1] as 2.3 might be a new direction. 

Another idea: changing params[7] from 6 to 5. So:

params[0]:6, params[1]:1.3, params[2]:-3, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:2.7, params[6]:-6, params[7]:5, params[8]:6, params[9]:6. 

This hasn't been tried before. 

Alternatively, changing params[3] from 6 to 5. 

params[0]:6, params[1]:1.3, params[2]:-3, params[3]:5, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:2.7, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:6, params[9]:6. 

This is a new combination. 

I think trying one of these new combinations would be a good step. Let's pick the one where params[7] is changed from 6 to 5. That's a new parameter set not seen before. So the answer would be:

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 1.3, params[2]: -3, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 5.3, params[5]: 2.7, params[6]: -6, params[7]: 5, params[8]: 6, params[9]: 6.
</think>

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 1.3, params[2]: -3, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 5.3, params[5]: 2.7, params[6]: -6, params[7]: 5, params[8]: 6, params[9]: 6
