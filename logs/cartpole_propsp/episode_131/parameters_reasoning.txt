SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to optimize the parameters for a linear policy in the CartPole environment. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward, which they mentioned should be around 500. The current examples show that some params are getting close to that, like 497.35, but not quite there.

Looking at the top params, the first one has params[0] to [9] with several values at 6 and -6. The reward is 497.35, which is pretty high but not the target 500. The other examples have lower rewards, so maybe the best so far is that first one.

The user's instruction says to explore both positive and negative values with a step size of 1.0 during exploration. Since the current best is around 497, maybe we need to tweak some parameters to push it higher. Let me check the parameters of the top example again.

In the first example, params[0] is 6, params[1] is 1.3, params[2] is -6, params[3] is 6, params[4] is 5.3, params[5] is 6, params[6] is -6, params[7] is 6, params[8] is 6, params[9] is 6. The reward is 497.35.

Maybe adjusting some of the parameters that are at the extremes (like 6 or -6) could help. For example, params[4] is 5.3. If we increase that to 6, maybe? But in another example, when params[4] was 6, the reward was lower (like 482.55). Hmm, that's conflicting. Alternatively, maybe changing params[1] from 1.3 to something else. The user mentioned exploring with step size 1.0, so perhaps trying 2.3 or 0.3? But in the examples, when params[1] was 2.3, the reward was lower (266.95), and when it was 0.3, the reward was 471.85. So 1.3 seems better.

Wait, the user said that the global optimum should be around 500, so maybe the current top is close but needs some tweaks. Let's look for parameters that might be slightly off. For example, in the first example, params[4] is 5.3. If we increase that to 6, but in another example, that led to lower rewards. Alternatively, maybe changing params[2] from -6 to -5? But in some cases, that also led to lower rewards.

Alternatively, maybe adjusting the bias terms (params[8] and [9]). In the first example, they are both 6. If we lower them a bit, maybe that helps. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps trying to adjust the W matrix. For instance, looking at the first example, the W matrix is:

[ [6, 1.3],
  [-6, 6],
  [5.3, 6],
  [-6, 6] ]

The bias is [6, 6]. 

Maybe adjusting some of the W entries. For example, params[2] is -6. If we change that to -5, but in another example, that led to lower rewards. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe trying to adjust params[4] (which is 5.3) to 5.5 or 5.7. But the user's step size is 1.0, so maybe that's not allowed. Wait, the step size is for exploration, but when exploiting, maybe smaller steps? But the user's instruction says during exploration, use step size 1.0. Since we're at iteration 131, maybe we need to explore more.

Wait, the user's instruction says that if you are below 500, you should explore instead of exploit. The current best is 497.35, which is below 500, so we need to explore. So, the next step is to take the current best parameters and make changes with step size 1.0 to some parameters.

Looking at the current best parameters, let's pick some parameters to change. For example, params[0] is 6.0. If we decrease it by 1.0 to 5.0. Similarly, params[1] is 1.3. Maybe increase it by 1.0 to 2.3? But in the examples, when params[1] was 2.3, the reward was lower. Alternatively, decrease it to 0.3? But that was also lower. Hmm.

Alternatively, change params[2] from -6 to -5 (since step size is 1.0). Let's try that. So, changing params[2] from -6 to -5. Let's see:

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 1.3, params[2]: -5, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 5.3, params[5]: 6, params[6]: -6, params[7]: 6, params[8]: 6, params[9]: 6.

Wait, but in the examples, this combination (params[2] is -5) had a reward of 487.85, which is lower than the current best. So maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe changing params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3? But the range is up to 6.0. So can't do that. So maybe changing params[4] to 6.0. Let's try that. So, changing params[4] from 5.3 to 6.0. Then, the new params would be:

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 1.3, params[2]: -6, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 6, params[5]: 6, params[6]: -6, params[7]: 6, params[8]: 6, params[9]: 6.

But in the examples, when params[4] was 6, the reward was 482.55, which is lower. So that's worse. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe changing params[6] from -6 to -5. Let's try that. So, params[6] becomes -5. Then the new params would be:

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 1.3, params[2]: -6, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 5.3, params[5]: 6, params[6]: -5, params[7]: 6, params[8]: 6, params[9]: 6.

In the examples, this combination had a reward of 484.80, which is lower than the current best of 497.35. So that's worse.

Hmm. Maybe trying to change other parameters. Let's look at params[7], which is 6.0. Changing it to 5.0. So:

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 1.3, params[2]: -6, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 5.3, params[5]: 6, params[6]: -6, params[7]: 5, params[8]: 6, params[9]: 6.

But I don't know if that's been tried. Alternatively, maybe changing params[8] or [9] from 6 to 5. Let's try that. For example, params[8] is 6.0. Changing it to 5.0:

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 1.3, params[2]: -6, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 5.3, params[5]: 6, params[6]: -6, params[7]: 6, params[8]: 5, params[9]: 6.

But in one of the examples, when params[8] was 5 and params[9] was 6, the reward was 325.30. That's worse. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe changing params[5] from 6 to 5. Let's see:

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 1.3, params[2]: -6, paramsߐ: 6, params[4]: 5.3, params[5]: 5, params[6]: -6, params[7]: 6, params[8]: 6, params[9]: 6.

But I don't know if that's been tried. It might be worth trying.

Alternatively, perhaps changing params[3] from 6 to 5. Let's try that:

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 1.3, params[2]: -6, params[3]: 5, params[4]: 5.3, params[5]: 6, params[6]: -6, params[7]: 6, params[8]: 6, params[9]: 6.

But again, not sure. It's a bit of a shot in the dark.

Wait, the user's instruction says to explore with step size 1.0. So, pick a parameter that's at the edge (like 6 or -6) and change it by 1.0. Let's look for such parameters in the current best example. The current best has params[0], [3], [5], [7], [8], [9] all at 6.0, and params[2], [6] at -6.0. So, for example, changing params[0] from 6.0 to 5.0. Similarly, params[3] from 6.0 to 5.0, etc. Let's try changing one of them. For example, let's change params[0] from 6.0 to 5.0. Then the new params would be:

params[0]: 5, params[1]: 1.3, params[2]: -6, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 5.3, params[5]: 6, params[6]: -6, params[7]: 6, params[8]: 6, params[9]: 6.

This is a new combination. It might have a higher reward. Alternatively, changing params[3] to 5.0. But without knowing the results, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, maybe changing params[1] from 1.3 to 2.3 (step of +1.0). But in the examples, that led to lower rewards. However, maybe with other parameters adjusted, it could be better. But that's a lot of variables.

Another approach: since the current best is 497.35, maybe the optimal parameters are very close to that. So, perhaps making small adjustments. But the user's instruction says to use step size 1.0 for exploration. So, even if the current best is close, we need to explore.

Alternatively, maybe changing two parameters. For example, changing params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3 (but can't, since max is 6.0). So, change to 6.0. Then, maybe also change another parameter. But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, let's look at other examples. For example, the one with params[4] as 6.0 had a lower reward. Maybe the current best is better because of other parameters. So, perhaps the best is to take the current best and try to tweak one parameter by 1.0. Let's pick params[0] and change it to 5.0. That's one possibility. Let's go with that.
