SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:

Now you are at iteration 20 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is working on optimizing the parameters for a linear policy in the CartPole environment. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward, which they mentioned should be around 500. The current examples show that the best so far is 304.80, which is quite a bit below 500. So, the user is probably looking for a way to explore more effectively to find a better solution.

Looking at the provided examples, the top params have some patterns. For instance, params[0] and params[3] are often around 4-5 and 3-4.2 respectively. The bias terms (params[8] and [9]) are around 2.3-3.3. However, since the current best is only 304, which is far from 500, the user needs to explore more rather than exploit the current local optimum.

The user mentioned using a search step size of 1.0 during exploration. So, I should consider varying the parameters by +/-1.0 from the current values. Let's take the top-performing params from the examples and see where we can adjust them. For example, the first example has params[0] at 5, params[1] at -0.7, params[2] at -5, etc. Maybe increasing some parameters or adjusting others could lead to better results.

Another thing to note is that the parameters are in the range [-6.0, 6.0] with one decimal place. So, possible values are like -6.0, -5.9, ..., 5.9, 6.0. The exploration step of 1.0 means that if a parameter is at 5, trying 6.0 or 4.0 could be beneficial. But since the current best is still low, maybe we need to try more radical changes.

Looking at the current top params, perhaps the W matrix isn't being optimized enough. For instance, in the first example, W is [[5, -0.7], [-5, 4.2], [1.3, -1.3], [-6, 6.2]]. Maybe adjusting some of the negative values to more positive ones or vice versa. Also, the bias terms might need adjustment. 

Since the user wants to avoid previously seen params, I need to ensure that the new parameters aren't in the examples provided. For example, in the first example, params[0] is 5, so maybe trying 6.0 or 4.0. Let's try increasing some parameters that are currently lower. For instance, params[2] is -5 in the first example. Changing that to -4 or -6 might help. Also, looking at the bias terms, maybe increasing params[8] and [9] further.

Another approach is to look for parameters that haven't been explored much. For example, in the examples, some parameters are around -5 to 5, but maybe trying higher values in some components. Let's consider varying each parameter by +/-1.0 from the current top ones. For example, take the first example and adjust params[0] to 6.0, params[1] to -0.7 (same), params[2] to -4.0 (since it was -5), params[3] to 5.2 (since it was 4.2), and so on. This could lead to a new set of parameters that haven't been tried yet.

Also, the user mentioned that the global optimum should be around 500, so the current exploration might not be sufficient. Maybe trying combinations where some parameters are higher or lower than the current examples. For example, setting some W values to 6.0 and others to -6.0, but ensuring that the overall policy is balanced.

In summary, the next step is to propose a new set of parameters that are different from the examples, using a step size of 1.0, and aiming to explore new regions of the parameter space to potentially find a better solution.
