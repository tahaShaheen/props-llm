SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 169 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, I need to help this user find the optimal parameters for their cartpole environment using reinforcement learning. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward.

First, let me understand the problem setup. They have a cartpole where a pole needs to stay upright on a cart without it tipping over. The state includes position, velocity, angle, and angular velocity. The action space has two options: push left or right.

The user mentioned using a linear policy with 18 parameters. Each iteration, they'll try different params values within the range of [-6.0, 6.0] to find the one that gives the highest reward.

Looking at their training examples, each has 10 params and an associated reward. They want me to propose new param values that have a higher reward than the current best.

I notice from their top performing parameters that some are negative, which might be effective in balancing the pole. But I should think about how different combinations could work better.

One approach is to increase positive params where beneficial and decrease others if they aren't contributing positively. For example, looking at their top example where params[3] is -1, maybe a slightly more balanced angle could help.

Another idea is to mix signs for some parameters, like having both left and right actions more often. This might improve the pole's balance without over-relying on one action.

I should also consider that the optimal reward is around 500, so I need to ensure my proposed params are in a range that can achieve this without getting stuck.

Maybe trying some random combinations near their top examples could yield better rewards. For instance, tweaking some of the negative actions slightly or adjusting positive ones differently might help.

I should be cautious not to repeat previous successful parameters but aim for different combinations where possible.
