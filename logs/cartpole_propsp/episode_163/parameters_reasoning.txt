SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 163 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help someone improve their cartpole environment with a linear policy. They've set up the parameters and are looking for better values. Let me see how I can guide them.

First, I should understand the problem they're facing. The cartpole is a classic reinforcement learning task where balancing a pole on a cart in a frictionless track is the goal. The state consists of position, velocity, angle, and angular velocity. The action is either pushing left or right, which are 0 and 1 respectively.

They have a policy defined as a linear function using parameters W and B. The reward is positive each time step the pole is upright (angle close to 0) and the cart is within bounds (-2.4 to 2.4). They want to maximize this episodic reward.

The current params are in the range of -6 to 6, with one decimal place. The user wants them to explore both sides by varying these parameters. They've already tried some values but need a more optimal set around 500.

Looking at their provided examples, most of the top performers have W and B combinations that push the reward close to 402 or higher. But others are lower, like 332 or 309. The user wants to try both higher and lower values by varying params[0] through [9].

Since I can't explore all possibilities manually, I should suggest a systematic approach. Maybe start by adjusting specific parameters that seem most impactful on the reward.

Parameters W[0], W[1], B[0], B[1]. These are used in state @ W + B for each action. The policy is linear, so moving these around could shift where actions are taken.

I should suggest varying params[0] and [8], as they might affect the cart's movement direction. Also, parameters that control pole stability (W[2], W[3]) and their biases might play a role in balancing the pole.

Perhaps increase some positive parameters and decrease others to see if it tips the pole over or makes it harder to balance. For example, pushing too hard might either help or hurt based on other factors.

I should also think about the interaction between these parameters. Maybe adjusting W[0] with params[1] could improve cart movement without causing too much disturbance in the pole.

Another idea is to test near-optimal values and see if they converge to a better point when refining. Since the user's reward is around 300-402, focusing on improving that range might be more effective than going higher or lower significantly.

I should also think about whether adding non-linear terms would help, but since it's a linear policy, perhaps keeping W and B fixed as much as possible while varying them slightly could yield better results.

In summary, I need to suggest varying specific parameters like [0], [2], [3], [4] (since the pole is affected by its angle) and [6] for balancing. Maybe start with small changes in these areas, both positive and negative, and observe how that affects performance.
