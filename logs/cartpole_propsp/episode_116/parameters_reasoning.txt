SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 116 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.

WARNING: This is attempt 2 out of 10. You have FAILED 1 times already. You have 8 attempts remaining. MAKE SURE THE FORMAT IS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT: 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, ...' with all values in range [-6.0, 6.0]. If you fail again, the entire episode will be discarded.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has provided a bunch of previous parameter sets and their corresponding rewards. The goal is to find the optimal parameters that maximize the episodic reward, which they mentioned should be around 500. The current best they have is 497.35, which is close but not quite there. 

Looking at the examples, the parameters that gave the highest rewards had some common elements. For instance, params[0] and params[1] were often 6 and 1.3, respectively. Also, params[2] and params[3] were frequently -6 and 6. Similarly, params[4] and params[5] were around 5.3 to 6, and params[6] and params[7] were -6 and 6. The bias terms (params[8] and params[9]) were mostly 6. However, in some cases, they were lower, like 5.

The user mentioned that during exploration, a step size of 1.0 should be used. Since the current best is 497.35, maybe we need to explore around that. Let's look at the parameters of that top entry: params[0] is 6, params[1] 1.3, params[2] -6, params[3] 6, params[4] 5.3, params[5] 6, params[6] -6, params[7] 6, and params[8] and [9] both 6. 

Perhaps tweaking some of these parameters could lead to a better reward. For example, looking at params[4] and [5], which are 5.3 and 6. Maybe increasing params[4] to 6 and keeping params[5] at 6? Or maybe adjusting params[1] slightly. Also, the bias terms are at 6; maybe increasing them further isn't possible since the max is 6. 

Alternatively, looking at other parameters. For instance, in some entries, params[2] was -5 instead of -6, but those had lower rewards. So maybe keeping params[2] at -6 is better. Similarly, params[3] is 6 in the top entries. 

Another thought: the user said to explore both positive and negative values. Maybe some parameters that were previously set to 6 could be adjusted down, or others set to lower values. But given that the current top has several parameters at the maximum (6), perhaps increasing some others that are not at the max yet. 

Wait, looking at the previous example where params[4] was 5.3 and params[5] 6. Maybe increasing params[4] to 6 could help. Let me check if that's allowed. Since the range is up to 6.0, so 6 is the max. So changing params[4] from 5.3 to 6.0. Let's try that. 

Also, looking at the bias terms. In the top entry, they are both 6. Maybe that's already the maximum. However, in some other entries, they were 5. But since 6 is the max, perhaps keeping them at 6 is better. 

Another parameter to consider is params[1], which is 1.3 in the top entry. What if we increase that to 2.3? Wait, in one of the examples, when params[1] was 2.3, the reward was 423.15, which is lower. So that might not be helpful. Maybe decreasing it? But 1.3 seems to be a sweet spot. 

Alternatively, maybe adjusting params[2] or params[6]. For example, in some entries, params[2] was -5, but those had lower rewards. So keeping params[2] at -6 might be better. Similarly, params[6] is -6 in the top entries. 

What about params[7]? It's 6 in the top entries. Maybe that's already optimal. 

So the main candidate for adjustment is params[4], which is 5.3. Changing that to 6.0 might improve the reward. Let's try that. So the new params would be:

params[0]:6, params[1]:1.3, params[2]:-6, params[3]:6, params[4]:6, params[5]:6, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:6, params[9]:6.

This is a modification of the top entry by increasing params[4] from 5.3 to 6.0. Let's see if that could lead to a higher reward. 

Alternatively, maybe adjusting params[5] from 6 to something else, but since it's already at the max, that might not be possible. 

Another possibility is to check if other parameters can be adjusted. For example, params[3] is 6, but maybe increasing it further isn't possible. 

I think the best bet here is to try changing params[4] to 6 and see what happens. If that doesn't work, perhaps other parameters can be adjusted. But given the exploration step size of 1.0, maybe trying that change is worth it. Also, since the current best is 497.35, and the global optimum is supposed to be around 500, this might be a step towards that.
