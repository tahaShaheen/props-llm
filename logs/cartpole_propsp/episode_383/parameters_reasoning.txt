SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to find the optimal parameters for this cartpole environment using reinforcement learning. The goal is to maximize the reward, which is +1 every time step where the pole is upright and the cart is within bounds. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of its allowed positions.

First, I remember that the policy here is a linear one with 18 parameters. These are organized in a matrix W (4x4) and a vector B (4). The action space is two actions: push left or right. So when the state comes in, it's a vector of [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]. Then we multiply this by W and add B to get the action.

The reward function f(params) is calculated each step where the pole is upright and within bounds, adding 1 for each such occurrence. The episode ends if either the pole tilts too far or the cart goes beyond -2.4 or 2.4.

Looking at the parameters provided in the top performing examples, they all have some combination of positive and negative values around ±6, which is within the given range of [-6.0, 6.0]. The reward for these parameters seems to consistently reach 500, which is a good sign because that's close to the suggested global optimum.

In the most recent example, params[0] is 6, params[1] is 7, and so on, with some negative values. That shows different parameter configurations can lead to various rewards, but they mostly cluster around higher rewards when using specific combinations of positive and negative values.

I think I should try to tweak the parameters a bit to see if I can get a higher reward than 500. Since all these top examples are giving 500, maybe slightly changing them could push it over or reach a higher number, but the suggestion is around 500, so perhaps they're already near the optimal point.

I need to consider how each parameter affects the policy. For instance, if I increase params[0] (cart_position), that might push the cart further right, which would help keep it within bounds and potentially increase the reward. But I have to balance other parameters like params[1] (cart_velocity) because too much velocity could make it move out of bounds.

Also, pole angle (params[2]) should be kept towards the center, especially since a stable pole needs the cart not only stay upright but also moving to keep it there. Angular velocity (params[3]) affects how quickly the pole can tilt. So if params[3] is negative, increasing angular velocity could help stabilize.

I might try to adjust some of these parameters in a way that increases their influence on keeping the pole upright and cart within bounds without letting them overpower other factors. For example, making params[0] slightly more positive than -6 but not too high, perhaps around -5 instead of -6, as per the range.

But I should be careful because increasing any parameter beyond its optimal might lead to worse performance. So maybe a small tweak in each relevant parameter could help without exceeding the boundaries set by [-6.0, 6.0].

I also recall that adjusting W and B matrices can have different effects. Since it's a linear policy, changing these weights can influence how each state contributes to the action selection. Maybe adjusting some of them could lead to better exploration in the parameter space.

Another thought is about the reward function itself. It counts only the time step where the pole is upright. So if the system remains balanced for more steps, it's better. Therefore, ensuring that the policy can maintain balance longer is crucial.

I might try tweaking params[0], [1], and others in a way that keeps everything within the range but allows for some variance to see how f(params) changes. Since all top examples have 500, maybe making slight adjustments could push it over or reach a higher number, which would be better than below 500.

But I need to ensure that even after tweaking, the policy doesn't get stuck in local optima. So perhaps using some form of randomization during exploration can help find better parameter values without getting stuck on the current top performers.

I'm starting to think that since all these top examples are giving around 500, which is close to the suggested optimal value, I might not need to tweak parameters much or even consider going lower. But it's better than nothing, and maybe exploring a bit more could help find an even higher reward, pushing towards the global optimum.

In summary, I'll adjust each parameter slightly, keeping them within [-6.0, 6.0], and see if that leads to a higher f(params). It might take some experimentation, but given the current top results, it's worth giving it a try.
