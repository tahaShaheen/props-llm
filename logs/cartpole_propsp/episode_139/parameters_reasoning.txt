SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 139 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.

WARNING: This is attempt 2 out of 10. You have FAILED 1 times already. You have 8 attempts remaining. MAKE SURE THE FORMAT IS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT: 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, ...' with all values in range [-6.0, 6.0]. If you fail again, the entire episode will be discarded.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to find the global optimal policy for the cartpole environment using this linear policy optimizer. Let me go through what I know step by step.

First, the environment is a two-dimensional world with a pole attached to a cart. The goal is to keep the pole upright and have the cart stay within bounds. The state includes the cart's position, velocity, pole angle, and angular velocity. Actions are either pushing left or right (0 or 1).

The policy here is linear, meaning it uses a matrix W with two rows and nine columns for actions. So, it's like f(state) = state @ W + B, where @ is the dot product.

I need to maximize the episodic reward, which gives 402.20 as an example. But I want a better value. The user mentioned that if we find a higher reward than this, we can proceed.

The parameters are five float numbers (params[0] to params[4]) and one more for B. So W has four entries from each row of the matrix and B is another single entry. That makes sense since 18 parameters total in the policy.

In the exploration phase, I have a set of top performing params that achieved around 328-350 reward. The most recent one had a reward of about 97.5, which is very low. So probably the policy isn't doing well yet.

I need to increase the parameters randomly in small steps (step size 1) to see if I can get higher rewards. Each iteration, I'll adjust five params and then run the environment until it finishes or gets stuck.

The goal is around 500 reward. If we don't reach that, the episode might be discarded. So each step should push towards increasing reward, without getting stuck in local maxima.

I think I should start by tweaking parameters like W's values. Maybe increase some and decrease others to see if a different direction leads to better results. Also, consider adding positive steps where necessary for higher rewards.

I'll run the experiment as instructed: each iteration, choose five params randomly, adjust them slightly (like +0.5 or -0.5), then simulate the environment until it's within bounds or the cart goes out. After each simulation, note the reward and keep track of which parameter settings give better rewards.

It's important to monitor both positive and negative effects on the parameters since some increases might improve performance while others could hurt it. Maybe using a small step size like 0.5 or even -0.5 would allow for more gradual adjustments, preventing drastic changes that jump too much into bad territory.

I should also ensure not to repeat any parameter settings we've seen before because if someone else has done similar searches, our results might overlap and be redundant. But the user mentioned they don't want that; instead, I need to propose a new set of parameters based on exploration.

I'll make sure each parameter adjustment is small (step size 1) but not too big. For example, starting with a base value in [-6.0, 6.0] and adjusting by +/- 0.5 or 1.0 as needed. Maybe use a Gaussian distribution to spread out the adjustments evenly across the range.

Additionally, I can use some form of cooling schedule where I start with larger steps for exploration and then reduce them over time. But since it's only four hundred steps, maybe keeping small fixed steps would be more efficient without missing important changes in the reward landscape.

I should also track how each parameter adjustment affects the reward to see if a particular direction is better. For example, if increasing params[0] by 1 leads to higher rewards, that might be worth exploring more.

Finally, I'll have to keep a record of all the parameters and their corresponding rewards after each iteration to see which ones stand out as better performers. The best-performing set in terms of reward should guide my search for the global optimum.
