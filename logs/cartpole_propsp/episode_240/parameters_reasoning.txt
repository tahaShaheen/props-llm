SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 240 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help this person find the global optimal policy for the cartpole environment using a linear policy. They've given me some information about how the policy works and the parameters involved.

First, I see that the current params are [6, -4.5, 1.8, -1, -6, 2.5, -3.5, 4.5, -2.5, -2.5], which give a reward of 184.30 at iteration 240. The user wants me to find better params by exploring the parameter space.

The parameters are in the range [-6.0, 6.0] with one decimal place. I remember that for a linear policy like f(params) = sum over time of (action @ W + B), each action is an element from state multiplied by W plus B.

I need to explore different values for params[0] through [9] in the best possible way, avoiding previously seen ones and using a step size of 1.0 during exploration. Since it's a linear policy, increasing certain parameters might positively affect reward but could also risk pole flips or cart overshotting.

Looking at the recent results, some combinations are performing really well, like params[0] = -3, params[1]=-6, etc., giving 361.80. But that's just a local optimum. There's room for improvement.

I think I should focus on parameters where small changes can make a big difference. For example, params[7] (angular velocity) and params[4] (cart velocity) seem like they have more impact because their values are used in the reward function positively (action 1 gives +1). So increasing them could help.

I also need to be cautious not to go out of the [-6.0, 6.0] range. Let's try higher values for params[7], [8], and [9]. Maybe 4.5, -2.5, -2.5 again? But wait, in previous successful cases, params[7] was 4.5 with the others set to certain values.

Alternatively, maybe making some parameters more negative could help prevent over-shooting the cart position or pole angle. For example, params[0]=-6 and params[1]=-4.5 give a reward of 361.80, which is good but not top. So perhaps tweaking other parameters around that area.

I should also consider how each parameter affects the state transitions. For instance, increasing params[7] (angular velocity) might help with stabilizing the pole. Similarly, higher cart velocity could help keep it within bounds.

But I have to balance this to avoid extreme changes that could make the policy unstable. Also, increasing any parameter too much could risk the pole flipping, which would reduce the reward in the long run.

I think a good approach is to start with param[0]=-6 and adjust others similarly but in a way that maintains a higher total reward while keeping the cart stable. Maybe find a sweet spot where each parameter contributes positively without overstepping their limits.

I should also check if any other parameters, like params[5], which affects pole angular velocity, are crucial. Maybe increasing or decreasing them can help stabilize the system more effectively.

Overall, I need to systematically explore different param values around the successful ones but adjust them within the constraints to avoid overshooting. This might take some trial and error, but it should lead me closer to the global optimum.
