SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

params[0]: -2.1; params[1]: 1.2; params[2]: 2.8; params[3]: -4.3; params[4]: 1.9; params[5]: 2.8; params[6]: -1.7; params[7]: -0.7; params[8]: -2.8; params[9]: -1.1; f(params): 53.00
params[0]: 1.2; params[1]: 2.8; params[2]: -4.3; params[3]: -5.6; params[4]: -0.8; params[5]: -3.9; params[6]: 0.7; params[7]: 3.2; params[8]: -0.3; params[9]: -0.7; f(params): 48.80
params[0]: -3.6; params[1]: -3.6; params[2]: 1.5; params[3]: -3.3; params[4]: 5; params[5]: 0.7; params[6]: -3.4; params[7]: 4; params[8]: 2.8; params[9]: 3.6; f(params): 46.80
params[0]: 0; params[1]: 5; params[2]: -3.3; params[3]: -3.3; params[4]: 0; params[5]: -0.5; params[6]: -1; params[7]: 4; params[8]: 3; params[9]: 2; f(params): 48.40


Now you are at iteration 35 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to find the optimal parameters for the cartpole environment using a linear policy gradient approach. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward, which rewards the pole staying upright and within bounds.

The user has provided several examples with their respective parameter values and corresponding rewards. Each example shows how changing some of the W and B matrices affects the reward. My task is to find the best combination that maximizes f(params).

First, I need to understand the structure of the linear policy. The action is based on the state vector [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]. The W matrix has 18 parameters (4x4) and B is a vector of 4 parameters. So, each W parameter can be adjusted to influence the actions.

Looking at the examples provided by the user, I see that some W and B values are negative, while others are positive or zero. It seems like having more positive W values might lead to higher rewards because it aligns with the desired actions (pushing left or right when needed). However, other parameters like cart_velocity and pole_angular_velocity might have a larger impact than the pole_angle since changing them can significantly affect the state, which in turn affects the reward.

I should analyze each parameter's contribution. Let's break down the W matrix into four 4x4 sections:

1. First row: params[0], [1; 2], [3; 4]
2. Second row: [5; 6], [7; 8], [9; 10]
3. Third row: [11; 12], [13; 14], [15; 16]
4. Fourth row: [17; 18], [19; 20], [21; 22]

Each of these can be adjusted to influence the policy.

I notice that in some examples, params[0] is negative while others are positive or zero. Similarly for other parameters. This suggests a need to explore both positive and negative values to see which combinations yield higher rewards.

Since we're aiming for a reward around 500, but the current examples only reach around 86-88, I'll need to fine-tune the parameters further.

Looking at params[4], which is cart_velocity's coefficient in W. A positive value here would increase the velocity state, which might lead to higher rewards if pushing the cart faster helps balance the pole.

Similarly, params[9] for pole_angular_velocity could be crucial because a pole that tips over (negative angle) affects the reward negatively. So increasing this might help maintain stability.

I should consider testing combinations where some parameters are positive and others are negative to see which direction gives better rewards. For instance, if a parameter is too negative in a beneficial context, it might reduce the reward instead of increasing it.

Another thing to note is that the cart's position (params[0]) and pole angle (params[2]) both have a range from -4.8 to 4.8 for position and from -0.418 to 0.418 for angle, respectively. Adjusting these could affect how much the cart can move and how stable the pole is.

Perhaps I should focus on parameters that directly influence the velocity of the cart (params[1] and [5;6]) because faster movement might help in balancing the pole. Also, the angular velocity (params[3];9) for the pole could be crucial to prevent it from spinning over.

I'll try setting some parameters higher than others to see if that leads to a better reward. For example, increasing params[4] and [7;10], which are cart_velocity's influence on pole stability, might help in maintaining balance as the pole tips. Also, adjusting params[3] could prevent the pole from spinning too much.

After experimenting with various combinations, I'll aim to find a set of parameters that significantly boost the reward without making any parameter excessively high or low (since values should be between -6 and 6). The key is finding the sweet spot where the sum of weighted actions across all time steps gives the highest possible cumulative reward.
