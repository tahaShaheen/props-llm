SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 35 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of previous params and their corresponding rewards. The goal is to find the optimal policy parameters that maximize the episodic reward, aiming for around 500. The current iteration is 35 out of 400, so there's a lot of steps left.

Looking at the examples, the highest reward so far is 398.45. But the user mentioned that the global optimum should be around 500, so we need to explore more. The previous params mostly have values around 6, 5, and some negatives. The B parameters (params 8 and 9) are often around 5-6. 

The user's note says to explore both positive and negative values with a step size of 1.0 during exploration. So maybe we should try varying some parameters more. Let's check which parameters might be critical. The W matrix has four rows, each with two weights. The B is a two-element vector. 

In the first example, params[0] is 6, params[1] 0.3, params[2] -4, params[3] 6, etc. The B terms are 6 and 6. Maybe increasing some of the W parameters or adjusting the B terms could help. But since the current best is 398, which is still below 500, we need to explore more.

Perhaps the current approach is too focused on certain parameters. Let's consider changing some parameters that haven't been explored much. For example, in the previous examples, params[2] ranges from -5 to -3, but maybe trying more negative values or even positive? Also, params[6] is often -6, maybe trying -5 or -7? Wait, but the allowed range is [-6.0, 6.0], so -6 is the minimum.

Wait, the user said that during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So if a parameter is at 6, maybe try 5 or 7 (but 7 is beyond the range). So maybe decrease some parameters by 1.0. Alternatively, increase some that are lower.

Looking at the current top examples, maybe the B terms (params 8 and 9) are high. Perhaps adjusting them could help. Let's see. In the first example, B is 6 and 6, which might be pushing the action towards one side. Maybe lowering them could allow more balanced exploration.

Alternatively, looking at the W matrix. For example, params[0] and [1] are 6 and 0.3. Maybe changing params[1] to a different value. Also, params[2] is -4, maybe trying -5 or -3. But since the user wants exploration, maybe try changing some parameters that haven't been varied much.

Another approach is to look for parameters that might be underexplored. For instance, in the examples, params[7] is often 6 or 6.2, but maybe trying lower values. Also, params[4] and [5] are around 4.3 and 1.7. Maybe adjusting those.

Since the user mentioned that during exploration, step size is 1.0, let's consider making larger changes. For example, if a parameter is at 6, try 5 (a step of -1). Or if it's at -4, try -5 or -3. Also, check if any parameters are not being varied much. For example, params[1] is mostly around 0.3 or -0.7. Maybe trying 1.3 or -1.3.

Wait, the user said to avoid previously seen params. So I need to ensure that the new params are not in the examples provided. Let me check the previous params. For example, in the first example, params[0] is 6, [1] 0.3, [2] -4, [3] 6, etc. So if I change params[2] to -5 (which was in another example), but that's already been tried. So need to find new values.

Looking at the examples, maybe trying to increase params[3] beyond 6.2? But the max is 6.0. So no. Maybe decrease some parameters. For instance, in the first example, params[6] is -6. Maybe trying -5? But that was in another example. Hmm.

Alternatively, looking at params[4], which is around 4.3. Maybe trying 5.3 or 3.3. But those have been tried. What about other parameters? For example, params[7] is 6.2 in some examples. Maybe trying 5.2 or 7.2 (but 7.2 is over the limit). So 5.2.

Wait, the user's note says to explore both positive and negative values. Maybe some parameters that are positive could be made negative, or vice versa. For example, in the first example, params[2] is -4. Maybe trying a more negative value, like -5.5? But the step is 1.0, so maybe -5 or -6 (but -6 is already used). 

Alternatively, looking at params[8] and [9], which are B terms. In some examples, they are 5.3, 4.8, etc. Maybe trying higher or lower. For instance, if they are 5.3, trying 6.3 (but that's over 6.0) or 4.3. But 4.3 was used.

This is a bit tricky. The key is to find new combinations that haven't been tried yet. Maybe changing multiple parameters at once. For example, take a previous high-performing param and adjust a few parameters by +/-1.0.

Looking at the first example (params[0]: 6; params[1]: 0.3; params[2]: -4; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 4.3; params[5]: 1.7; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 6; params[9]: 6; f(params): 398.45). Maybe changing params[2] from -4 to -5 (but that was in another example), or params[3] from 6 to 5. Let's try that. So params[3] becomes 5.0. Also, maybe adjust params[8] and [9] to 5.0 each. That would be a new combination.

So, new params could be:

params[0]: 6.0

params[1]: 0.3

params[2]: -4.0

params[3]: 5.0 (changed from 6.0)

params[4]: 4.3

params[5]: 1.7

params[6]: -6.0

params[7]: 6.0

params[8]: 5.0 (changed from 6.0)

params[9]: 5.0 (changed from 6.0)

This way, we're making changes to params[3], [8], and [9], which might lead to a different outcome. Alternatively, maybe adjusting other parameters. But need to ensure that this combination hasn't been tried before. Looking back at the examples, I don't see this exact combination, so it's a new one.

Another approach: take a lower-performing example and adjust some parameters. For instance, the example with f=255.25: params[0]:6, [1]:0.3, [2]:-5, [3]:6, [4]:5.3, [5]:2.7, [6]:-5, [7]:6, [8]:5, [9]:5. Maybe changing [4] from 5.3 to 4.3, and [5] from 2.7 to 1.7. That would make it similar to the first example but with different [6] and [8]/[9]. But again, need to check if that's been done before.

Alternatively, let's think about the policy function. The action is the argmax of state @ W + B. So, for the policy to balance the pole, the weights should be such that when the cart is off-center (high position), the action pushes it back. Similarly, if the pole is leaning, the angular velocity should be considered. 

Maybe increasing the weight on the angular velocity terms (params[5] or [7]) could help. For example, in some examples, params[5] is 1.7, but maybe increasing to 2.7. However, that was tried in another example. 

Alternatively, adjusting params[1] from 0.3 to 1.3, which might influence the position's weight. Let's try that. So, for example:

params[0]: 6.0

params[1]: 1.3 (changed from 0.3)

params[2]: -4.0

params[3]: 6.0

params[4]: 4.3

params[5]: 1.7

params[6]: -6.0

params[7]: 6.0

params[8]: 6.0

params[9]: 6.0

This would be a new combination. However, I need to check if this has been tried before. Looking through the examples, I don't see params[1] at 1.3. So this might be a good candidate for exploration.

Another possibility is to decrease params[0] from 6.0 to 5.0 and increase params[1] from 0.3 to 1.3. That would be a new combination. Let's try that:

params[0]: 5.0

params[1]: 1.3

params[2]: -4.0

params[3]: 6.0

params[4]: 4.3

params[5]: 1.7

params[6]: -6.0

params[7]: 6.0

params[8]: 6.0

params[9]: 6.0

This could potentially balance the weights differently. 

Alternatively, changing params[2] to -3.0 (since previous examples have -4, -5). Let's try that:

params[0]: 6.0

params[1]: 0.3

params[2]: -3.0

params[3]: 6.0

params[4]: 4.3

params[5]: 1.7

params[6]: -6.0

params[7]: 6.0

params[8]: 6.0

params[9]: 6.0

This is another new combination. 

Considering all these possibilities, I need to pick one that hasn't been tried before. Let's go with changing params[1] to 1.3 and params[0] to 5.0. That way, we're exploring a different part of the parameter space. The new params would be:

params[0]: 5.0

params[1]: 1.3

params[2]: -4.0

params[3]: 6.0

params[4]: 4.3

params[5]: 1.7

params[6]: -6.0

params[7]: 6.0

params[8]: 6.0

params[9]: 6.0

This combination hasn't been in the examples provided, so it's a valid new exploration step. The idea is to adjust the weights on the position (params[0] and [1]) to see if a lower value for params[0] and higher for params[1] could improve performance.
