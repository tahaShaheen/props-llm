SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 171 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to optimize the cartpole environment using a linear policy. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward f(params), which is around 500 as per the user's note. Right now, after iteration 171 out of 400, the current params are:

params[0]: -4.5; params[1]: -2.4; params[2]: 1.3; params[3]: -1; params[4]: -4.5; params[5]: 1.5; params[6]: -3.5; params[7]: 4.5; params[8]: -2.5; params[9]: -2.5.

The reward f(params) is 254.95, which is quite low. The user wants to explore further to potentially find a higher reward.

I need to choose parameters in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], one decimal place each. I'll aim for values that are likely to explore both positive and negative regions given the current params. Maybe around -4 to +2 or similar.

Let me think about possible parameters:

params[0]: Let's say -3.5, which is in the middle of the exploration zone between -4.5 and -2.4.

params[1]: I'll choose -1.8 instead of -2.4, moving towards more negative to see if that helps with balancing.

params[2]: Perhaps 1.7, a bit less than current 1.3 but still in the exploration zone.

params[3]: Let's go to -0.5 since it's a lower action value for exploring.

params[4]: Maybe -4.5 is better here because it's at the lower end of the environment's position range.

Wait, params[4] is -4.5, same as current. That might not be helpful. Perhaps slightly lower, like -4.0?

params[5]: Let me try 1.6 instead of 1.5 to see if it improves the reward further.

params[6]: Hmm, current is -3.5. Maybe increase a bit to -2.8 for more exploration in balance angle.

params[7]: Currently 4.5, which might be pushing too much. Let's try 3.5 instead to limit action.

params[8]: Current is -2.5. Maybe raise it to -1.5 to give more exploration space around that area.

params[9]: Lower current is -2.5; let me set it to -2.0 for a slightly higher value.

So, compiling these choices:

params[0]: -3.5

params[1]: -1.8

params[2]: 1.7

params[3]: -0.5

params[4]: -4.0

params[5]: 1.6

params[6]: -2.8

params[7]: 3.5

params[8]: -1.5

params[9]: -2.0

I think this spread should allow exploration in both positive and negative directions, covering more ground without being too random. It's also within the specified range, so it's safe.
