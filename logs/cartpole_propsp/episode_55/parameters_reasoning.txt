SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of training examples with different params and their corresponding f(params) values. The goal is to find the global optimal policy, which they mentioned should be around 500. The current examples have f(params) values up to 428.05, which is below 500, so there's definitely room for improvement.

First, I need to analyze the existing params to see what patterns emerge. Looking at the top-performing ones, like the first one with f=428.05, the params are mostly high values, especially in W and B. For example, params[0], [1], [3], [4], [5], [7], [8], [9] are all high (6, 1.3, 6, 5.3, 2.7, 6, 6, 6). Some of the other params like [2] and [6] are negative (-3 and -6). 

But since the global optimum is supposed to be around 500, maybe we need to explore more. The user mentioned that if we're below 500, we should explore instead of exploit. So even though some params give decent rewards, we need to try different values.

The user also said to use a search step size of 1.0 during exploration. So, perhaps adjusting some of the parameters by +/-1.0 from the current ones. Let's check the current top params. For example, in the first entry, params[0] is 6.0. Maybe increasing some parameters beyond 6 isn't possible since the range is up to 6.0. But maybe decreasing some of the high values or adjusting the negative ones.

Wait, the parameters are in the range [-6.0, 6.0], with one decimal place. So, they can't go beyond that. So, for parameters that are already at 6.0, we can't increase them further. But maybe adjusting others. For instance, params[2] is -3.0 in some examples. Maybe trying more negative values here, like -4.0 or -5.0, but that might not be helpful. Alternatively, maybe adjusting the B terms (params[8] and [9]) which are currently at 6.0. Could lowering them help?

Alternatively, looking at the structure of the policy: action is the argmax of state @ W + B. So, the policy is trying to maximize the linear combination. Maybe the optimal policy requires balancing different state features. For example, the cart position and velocity, and the pole angle and angular velocity. 

Looking at the W matrix, each row corresponds to a state feature. The first row is cart position multiplied by params[0] and params[1]. Maybe adjusting these to influence the cart's movement. But I'm not sure. 

Since exploration is needed, perhaps trying to change some parameters that are currently at the extremes. For example, in the first example, params[0] is 6.0. Maybe changing that to 5.0 and see. But the user said not to propose previously seen params. Wait, the user mentioned that in step 1, they will provide examples, and in step 2, the assistant should propose new params. But in the current case, the user has already given a bunch of examples, and the assistant is at iteration 55. So, the assistant needs to generate new params that haven't been tried before.

Looking at the existing params, many have params[0] at 6.0, params[3] at 6.0, params[4] at 5.3, params[5] at 2.7, etc. Maybe trying to vary some of these. For example, changing params[4] from 5.3 to 6.0, or params[5] from 2.7 to 3.7. But some of these have been tried already.

Alternatively, maybe adjusting the B terms. In the first example, B is [6,6], but in some other examples, it's [5,5]. Maybe trying B values like 4 or 6. But again, need to avoid previous ones.

Wait, the user said "Do not propose previously seen params." So, looking at the examples, the first one has params[0] to [9] as 6,1.3,-3,6,5.3,2.7,-6,6,6,6. The second one is similar but params[5] is 3.7. So, maybe trying to vary some parameters that haven't been tried yet. For example, changing params[1] from 1.3 to 0.3 or 2.3, but some of those have been tried.

Alternatively, looking for parameters that haven't been varied much. For example, params[6] is often -6.0, but in some examples it's -5.0. Maybe trying -4.0 or -6.0 again. But need to avoid previous ones.

This is a bit tricky. Since the user wants exploration with step size 1.0, maybe taking a parameter that's in the middle and adjusting it. For example, in the first example, params[2] is -3.0. Maybe changing that to -4.0 (since that's a step of 1.0). But in some examples, params[2] is -4.0. Wait, looking at the examples, there is one where params[2] is -4.0 (params[0]: 6; params[1]: 0.3; params[2]: -4; ...). So that's already been tried. 

Another approach: check which parameters are not at the extremes. For example, params[1] is 1.3 in some examples, 0.3, 2.3. Maybe trying 3.3? But that's beyond 6.0? No, 3.3 is within the range. But the user said to use a step size of 1.0, so maybe adjusting from existing values. For example, if params[1] is 1.3, adding or subtracting 1.0 would make it 0.3 or 2.3. But those have been tried.

Alternatively, looking at params[4], which is 5.3 in some cases. Adding 1.0 would make it 6.3, but that's beyond 6.0. So can't. Subtracting 1.0 would make it 4.3, which has been tried in some examples.

This is challenging. Maybe the best approach is to take one of the existing high-performing params and make a small change to one of the parameters that hasn't been varied much. For example, in the first example, params[7] is 6.0. Maybe changing that to 5.0. But that's a step of 1.0. However, in some examples, params[7] is 6.0, so that's already been tried. 

Alternatively, looking at params[6], which is -6.0 in many cases. Maybe changing that to -5.0, but that's been tried. Or -7.0? No, the range is -6.0 to 6.0.

Hmm. Maybe trying to adjust params[8] and [9], which are B terms. In some examples, they are 6,6, but in others 5,5. Maybe trying 4.0 or 7.0? No, 7.0 is beyond. So 4.0. But I need to check if that's been tried. Looking through the examples, the B terms are mostly 6,6 or 5,5. So trying 4.0 for one of them.

Another idea: looking at the W matrix. Maybe the current examples have params[0] and [3] as 6.0. What if we lower one of them to 5.0 and increase another? For example, params[0] from 6.0 to 5.0 and params[3] from 6.0 to 6.0 (no change). But that might not help.

Alternatively, looking at the pole angle parameters. params[4] and [5] are 5.3 and 2.7. Maybe increasing params[5] to 3.7 (as in one of the examples) but that's already been tried. 

Wait, the user mentioned that the global optimum is around 500, but the current highest is 428. So maybe the existing parameters are not sufficient. Perhaps trying to adjust some parameters that are not at the extremes. For example, params[2] is -3.0. Maybe changing that to -2.0 (adding 1.0). But that's a step of 1.0. However, I need to check if that's been tried. Looking through the examples, I don't see params[2] at -2.0. So that's a new value. 

So, let's try that. Take the first example's params: 6,1.3,-3,6,5.3,2.7,-6,6,6,6. Change params[2] from -3.0 to -2.0. That would be a new parameter set. Maybe that could lead to higher rewards. 

Alternatively, changing params[6] from -6.0 to -5.0 (already tried), or maybe changing params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3 (invalid). Not helpful. 

Another possibility: looking at the B terms. In the first example, they are 6,6. Maybe lowering one of them to 5.0. But that's been tried in other examples. 

Alternatively, changing params[1] from 1.3 to 2.3. But that's been tried in one of the examples (params[1]: 2.3 in one of the entries). 

Hmm. This is really tricky. Maybe the best approach is to take one of the existing parameters and vary one of the parameters that hasn't been adjusted much. For example, in the first example, params[5] is 2.7. Maybe changing that to 3.7 (as in one of the examples) but that's already been tried. 

Alternatively, looking at params[7], which is 6.0. Maybe changing that to 5.0 (a step of 1.0). But I need to check if that's been tried. In one of the examples, params[7] is 5.0 (params[3] is 5 in one entry). So that's been tried. 

Wait, in the example with f=97.60, params[3] is 5.0. So maybe that's not helpful. 

At this point, maybe the assistant should generate a new set of parameters by varying one parameter by +/-1.0 from an existing example, ensuring that it hasn't been tried before. Let's pick the first example: [6,1.3,-3,6,5.3,2.7,-6,6,6,6]. Let's vary params[2] from -3.0 to -4.0 (but that's been tried in another example). Or to -2.0 (not tried). So changing params[2] to -2.0. That's a new parameter. So the new params would be [6,1.3,-2,6,5.3,2.7,-6,6,6,6]. 

Alternatively, changing params[4] from 5.3 to 4.3 (already tried in some examples). 

Another option: changing params[5] from 2.7 to 3.7 (already tried). 

Hmm. Maybe changing params[8] from 6.0 to 5.0. But that's been tried. 

Alternatively, changing params[6] from -6.0 to -5.0 (already tried). 

Wait, the user said to use a step size of 1.0 during exploration. So, maybe take a parameter that's in the middle and adjust it. For example, in the first example, params[1] is 1.3. Adding 1.0 would make it 2.3 (already tried), subtracting 1.0 makes it 0.3 (also tried). 

Another parameter: params[4] is 5.3. Adding 0.7 would make it 6.0, but that's a step of 0.7, not 1.0. Not allowed. 

This is really challenging. Maybe the assistant should take a parameter that's been kept constant and adjust it. For example, in many examples, params[0] is 6.0. Maybe changing that to 5.0. But that's a step of 1.0. However, in some examples, params[0] is 5.0? Let me check the examples. Looking through the list, the example with f=97.60 has params[0] as 6.0. Others have 6.0. So maybe changing params[0] to 5.0. That's a new parameter. 

So, new params: [5.0, 1.3, -3.0, 6.0, 5.3, 2.7, -6.0, 6.0, 6.0, 6.0]. 

But I need to make sure that this hasn't been tried before. Looking through the examples, I don't see any with params[0] as 5.0. So this is a new set. 

Alternatively, changing params[0] to 6.0 (already tried). 

So, the assistant could propose this new set. But I'm not sure if it's the best approach. However, given the constraints, this might be the way to go. 

Another possibility is to change multiple parameters. For example, decreasing params[0] from 6.0 to 5.0 and increasing params[2] from -3.0 to -2.0. But that's two changes. 

Alternatively, changing one parameter that hasn't been varied much. For example, in the first example, params[7] is 6.0. Maybe changing that to 5.0. But that's been tried in some examples. 

At this point, I think the best approach is to take the first example's parameters and change one parameter by +/-1.0, ensuring that it hasn't been tried before. Let's go with changing params[2] from -3.0 to -2.0. So the new params would be:

params[0]: 6.0
params[1]: 1.3
params[2]: -2.0
params[3]: 6.0
params[4]: 5.3
params[5]: 2.7
params[6]: -6.0
params[7]: 6.0
params[8]: 6.0
params[9]: 6.0

This hasn't been tried before, as per the examples provided. This could be a candidate for exploration.
