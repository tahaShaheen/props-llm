SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has provided a bunch of training examples for the CartPole environment with different parameter values and their corresponding episodic rewards. All of them have a reward of 500.00 except a few which are lower. The current iteration is 55 out of 400, and the goal is to find the global optimal policy, which is supposed to be around 500. However, the user mentioned that if we're below that, we should explore instead of exploit.

Looking at the examples, many of the params have values that are similar, especially around params[0] to params[7], with some variations. The B parameters (params[8] and params[9]) are mostly around 3.3 to 4.2. The ones that had lower rewards had changes in params[0], params[1], params[4], params[5], and params[8], params[9]. For example, when params[0] was changed to 4.2, the reward dropped to 495. Similarly, changing params[1] to 5.3 led to a much lower reward.

Since the current examples are all at 500.00, which is the maximum possible, but the user says the global optimum should be around 500, maybe there's a need to explore further. However, the user also says not to propose previously seen params. So I need to come up with new parameter combinations that haven't been tried yet but are within the [-6.0, 6.0] range with one decimal place.

Looking at the existing params, perhaps there are parameters that haven't been varied much. For example, the W matrix parameters (params[0]-params[7]) have some values that could be adjusted. Let's check the existing params. In the first example, params[0] is 3.2, params[1] is 4.3, params[2] is 1.3, params[3] is 4.6, params[4] is -2.4, params[5] is 1.9, params[6] is -4.9, params[7] is -0.1. The B parameters are 3.3 and 4.2.

Maybe trying to adjust some of the parameters that have been kept constant. For example, params[7] is -0.1 in many examples. Maybe trying a different value here. Also, params[6] is -4.9 in several cases. What if we adjust that? Or perhaps the params[4] which is -2.4 in some examples. Maybe trying a different value for params[4], like -3.4 or -1.4, but those have been tried and resulted in lower rewards. However, maybe other values?

Alternatively, looking at the W matrix. Each row of W is multiplied by the state vector. The state includes cart position, velocity, pole angle, and angular velocity. So maybe the parameters that are responsible for the pole angle (params[4] and params[5]) could be adjusted. For example, in some examples, params[4] is -2.4, which might be important for balancing the pole. If we increase that to -1.4, but that led to lower rewards. Alternatively, maybe decreasing it further to -3.4, but that also didn't work well.

Alternatively, looking at the B parameters. The existing examples have B as 3.3 and 4.2. Maybe adjusting those. For example, trying B as 4.3 or 5.2. But need to check if those have been tried. Wait, in one example, params[8] was 4.3 and params[9] 4.2, which gave 500. So maybe increasing params[8] to 5.3? But that might be too high. Alternatively, trying lower values.

Another approach: since the current examples are all at 500, maybe we can try to explore by making small changes to the parameters. The user suggested using a search step size of 1.0 during exploration. So for each parameter, we can try adding or subtracting 1.0 from the current value. However, we need to ensure that the new values are within [-6.0, 6.0].

Looking at the current example, let's take the first one: params[0] is 3.2. Adding 1.0 would make it 4.2, which was tried and resulted in 495. So that's worse. Subtracting 1.0 would make it 2.2. Maybe that's a new value. Similarly for other parameters.

For example, params[2] is 1.3. Adding 1.0 gives 2.3, which was tried (in one example, params[2] was 2.3, and the reward was 500). Subtracting 1.0 gives 0.3, which was also tried. So maybe trying other parameters. Let's look at params[6], which is -4.9. Adding 1.0 would be -3.9, which was tried. Subtracting 1.0 would be -5.9, which was tried. But what about other parameters?

Looking at params[7], which is -0.1. Adding 1.0 would be 0.9, which was tried. Subtracting 1.0 would be -1.1, which was also tried. So perhaps trying other parameters.

What about params[3], which is 4.6. Adding 1.0 gives 5.6, which was tried in one example. Subtracting 1.0 gives 3.6, which was also tried. So maybe that's not helpful.

Looking at the B parameters: params[8] is 3.3. Adding 1.0 gives 4.3, which was tried. Subtracting gives 2.3. Maybe trying that. Similarly, params[9] is 4.2. Adding 1.0 gives 5.2, which hasn't been tried. Let's see if that's possible.

So, if I take the current example (params[0] to params[9] as in the first example) and adjust params[8] and params[9] to 2.3 and 5.2, respectively. That might be a new combination. Alternatively, trying to adjust other parameters.

Alternatively, looking at params[5], which is 1.9. Adding 1.0 gives 2.9, which was tried in one example. Subtracting gives 0.9, which hasn't been tried. Maybe that's a possibility.

Another thought: since all the current examples are at 500, which is the maximum possible, maybe the optimal policy is already found. However, the user says that the global optimum should be around 500, but if we are below that, we should explore. But since all the examples are at 500, perhaps we need to check if there are other parameters that can also reach 500, but the user says not to propose previously seen params. So the challenge is to find new parameters that haven't been tried yet but can also reach 500.

Looking at the existing examples, let's see which parameters are the same. For example, params[0] is 3.2 in many examples. params[1] is 4.3. params[2] is 1.3 in some, 2.3 in others. params[3] is 4.6 or 5.6. params[4] is -2.4 or -3.4 or -1.4. params[5] is 1.9 or 2.9. params[6] is -4.9, -5.9, -3.9, etc. params[7] is -0.1, -1.1, 0.9. params[8] is 3.3, 4.3. params[9] is 4.2, 3.2.

So perhaps trying to vary params[4] to -3.4 (already tried), but maybe other values. Or maybe adjusting params[7] to other values. For example, trying params[7] as -2.1 (which hasn't been tried yet). Similarly, trying other combinations.

Alternatively, since the user says that during exploration, use a step size of 1.0, maybe we can take one parameter and change it by 1.0 from the current value. For example, taking the first example's params and changing params[0] from 3.2 to 2.2 (subtracting 1.0). Let's see if that's a new value. In the existing examples, there was a params[0] of 3.2, 4.2, but not 2.2. So that's a new value.

So, let's try changing params[0] to 2.2, keeping the rest the same. That would be a new parameter set. Similarly, changing other parameters by 1.0 step. But we need to ensure that the new parameters are within [-6.0, 6.0].

Another possibility is to change params[8] from 3.3 to 4.3 (already tried), or 2.3. Let's try 2.3. So, if we take the first example's params and change params[8] to 2.3, that's a new combination. Similarly, changing params[9] to 5.2 (which hasn't been tried yet).

But since the user wants to maximize the function's value, and the current examples are all at 500, which is the maximum, but the global optimum might be slightly higher. However, the user says that the global optimum is around 500. So maybe there's no higher value, but the task is to find it.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal is exactly 500, and the current examples are already at that. But the user says that if you are below that, you should explore. But since we are at 500, maybe the answer is that we can't go higher, and the optimal is found. However, the user might expect us to try new combinations even if they are at 500, but not previously seen.

So, to comply with the user's instruction, we need to propose new params that haven't been used before. Let's look for parameters that haven't been tried. For example, in the existing examples, params[0] is 3.2, 4.2, but not 2.2. Let's try changing params[0] to 2.2, keeping other parameters the same. That would be a new set.

Alternatively, changing params[7] to -2.1, which hasn't been tried. Or changing params[5] to 0.9 (since in some examples it's 1.9, 2.9, but not 0.9).

Another approach: look for parameters that have not been varied much. For instance, in the existing examples, params[2] has been 1.3, 2.3, 0.3. So maybe trying 3.3? That's within the range. Similarly, params[3] has been 4.6, 5.6, 3.6. Maybe trying 6.6? But that's beyond 6.0. So no. Maybe 2.6? Not sure.

Alternatively, looking at the B parameters. In the existing examples, params[8] is 3.3, 4.3, and params[9] is 4.2, 3.2. Maybe trying params[8] as 5.3, but that might be too high. Or 1.3, which was tried.

Hmm. This is a bit tricky. Let me think again. The user wants me to generate new params that haven't been used before. Let's check the existing examples again. For example, in one example, params[8] was 4.3, params[9] 4.2. In another, params[8] was 3.3, params[9] 3.2. So maybe trying params[8] as 4.3, params[9] as 5.2. That's a new combination.

Alternatively, changing params[4] to -2.4 (already tried), but maybe other values. For example, -4.4. But that's not in the examples. However, the user said that during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So if the current value is -2.4, adding or subtracting 1.0 would be -3.4 or -1.4. But those have been tried and resulted in lower rewards. So perhaps that's not helpful.

Another idea: look for parameters that are in the middle of the range. For example, params[0] is 3.2. What if we try 3.2 + 1.0 = 4.2 (already tried), or 3.2 -1.0 = 2.2 (new). Similarly for other parameters.

So, let's try changing one parameter by 1.0. Let's pick params[0] to 2.2. So the new params would be:

params[0]: 2.2; params[1]: 4.3; params[2]: 1.3; params[3]: 4.6; params[4]: -2.4; params[5]: 1.9; params[6]: -4.9; params[7]: -0.1; params[8]: 3.3; params[9]: 4.2.

This hasn't been tried before, as far as I can see. So that's a new parameter set. Alternatively, changing params[2] to 2.3 (already tried), or to 0.3 (already tried). So 2.2 is new.

Alternatively, changing params[8] to 4.3 (already tried), but maybe changing params[9] to 5.2. Let's try that. So:

params[0]: 3.2; params[1]: 4.3; params[2]: 1.3; params[3]: 4.6; params[4]: -2.4; params[5]: 1.9; params[6]: -4.9; params[7]: -0.1; params[8]: 3.3; params[9]: 5.2.

That's a new combination. But need to check if any of the previous examples had params[9] as 5.2. From the given examples, I don't see that. So that's a new set.

Alternatively, changing params[7] to -2.1 (which hasn't been tried yet). So:

params[0]: 3.2; params[1]: 4.3; params[2]: 1.3; params[3]: 4.6; params[4]: -2.4; params[5]: 1.9; params[6]: -4.9; params[7]: -2.1; params[8]: 3.3; params[9]: 4.2.

That's another new set.

But which one should I choose? Since the user says to explore with step size 1.0, maybe changing one parameter by 1.0. So, for example, changing params[0] from 3.2 to 2.2. That's a step of -1.0. Alternatively, changing params[8] from 3.3 to 4.3 (which was tried, but gives 495), so maybe not. Or changing params[9] to 5.2 (which is +1.0 from 4.2). That could be a new set.

Alternatively, changing params[6] from -4.9 to -5.9 (already tried), or to -3.9 (already tried). So no. What about params[5] from 1.9 to 0.9 (step of -1.0). That's a new value. So:

params[0]: 3.2; params[1]: 4.3; params[2]: 1.3; params[3]: 4.6; params[4]: -2.4; params[5]: 0.9; params[6]: -4.9; params[7]: -0.1; params[8]: 3.3; params[9]: 4.2.

This hasn't been tried before, as far as I can see. So that's a new parameter set.

I think any of these would be valid. Since the user wants to explore, I'll pick one of these new combinations. Let's go with changing params[5] to 0.9. That seems like a new parameter set and follows the exploration step.
