SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 313 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to get closer to the global optimal policy for the cartpole environment using reinforcement learning. The goal is to balance the pole and keep the cart within its bounds, which seems like a classic problem in RL.

First, I understand that the current params array has 10 values with one decimal place each. These are all within the range of -6.0 to 6.0, so they're valid according to the constraints mentioned.

Looking at the examples provided, several parameter sets yield an f(params) value of 500.00, which is considered a local optimum because the user says we need around 500 for the global optimum. The most recent example has a lower f(params) of 151.35, but that's probably from earlier iterations.

Since the current iteration is at 313 out of 400, it's still in the middle of exploration versus exploitation. To improve this, I should consider both positive and negative values for each parameter, especially since some are already at the upper bound (6) or lower bound (-6). This might help in exploring different regions of the parameter space.

I remember that the policy is a linear function approximator, so changing all parameters can affect how well the policy works. Maybe I should try increasing some parameters while decreasing others to see if it improves the reward more significantly than the decrease would hurt.

Let me think about each parameter:

- params[0] (cart_position): This probably affects how quickly the cart moves. Increasing this might make it harder to balance, so maybe not ideal.
- params[1] (cart_velocity): Higher velocity makes it harder to slow down, perhaps good for exploration.
- params[2] (pole_angle): More control here might help stabilize the pole. If it's too low or high, it could lead to instability. I should adjust accordingly.
- params[3] (pole_angular_velocity): Similar to cart_velocity but affects angular movement. It seems important for stability.
- params[4], [5], [6], [7]: These likely correspond to velocity and angular velocity in the state vector. Adjusting these could balance the forces and torques applied, which might improve the pole's balance.
- params[8], [9]: These are B parameters, so changing them could shift the reward function towards more favorable areas.

Since the current f=params is 500, maybe I can tweak the middle parameters. For example, increasing some while decreasing others in a balanced way could result in better rewards without too much loss.

I should try modifying params[1] and [3] to see how they affect the pole's stability. Also, adjusting params[2], [4], [5], etc., might help balance the system more effectively.

Perhaps starting with small adjustments around 6 for some and -6 for others could lead to a higher reward without making the problem too difficult. It's all about finding a sweet spot that keeps the pole upright while keeping the cart within bounds, but not pushing it beyond where it becomes unstable.

I also need to be careful not to make any changes that would worsen performance significantly. Maybe I can try increasing some parameters and see if the reward improves enough without overstepping. For example, if params[1] is 6, maybe increase it slightly to 6.5 in the next iteration while decreasing others a bit.

Wait, but since each change affects multiple parameters, changing one might have ripple effects on the entire policy's performance. It's tricky because I don't know how sensitive each parameter is yet. Maybe I can try a more systematic approach by adjusting some and seeing the result.

Let me outline a possible adjustment plan:

1. Increase params[1] from 6 to 6.5.
2. Decrease params[3] slightly from 6 to 5.8.
3. For params[2], maybe increase it a bit but not too much—like 4 instead of -3.5.
4. Keep other parameters as they are.

I should see how the f(params) changes after making these adjustments. If it improves, I can continue exploring nearby values; if not, maybe go back and try different combinations.

Also, perhaps increasing params[1] beyond 6 might help balance the system more quickly without causing too much movement in the cart. But since the upper limit is 6, that's within the constraints.

Another thought: since the reward is +1 each time the pole is upright and the cart is within bounds, maybe adding a bonus for keeping the pole upright longer could boost the reward further. That might require adjusting params[2], but I should be cautious not to make it too aggressive.

I also need to remember that all these changes are part of the policy's parameters, so if changing them leads to worse performance, perhaps they're not useful anymore and should be set back. But since some examples already yield 500, maybe tweaking isn't necessary yet.

It's a bit confusing without knowing how each parameter affects the system, but based on the current setup, I think starting with small adjustments around the upper bounds for some parameters and lower them for others could help improve performance.
