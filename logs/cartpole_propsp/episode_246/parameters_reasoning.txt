SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 246 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is working on optimizing a linear policy for the CartPole environment. They've provided a bunch of previous parameter sets and their corresponding rewards. The goal is to get as close as possible to the global optimum, which they mention should be around 500. The current iteration is 246 out of 400, so there's still room for exploration.

Looking at the examples, the top-performing params have several common elements. For instance, params[0] is often 6, params[1] is around 2.3, params[2] is -5, params[3] is 6, params[4] is 5.3, params[5] is 6, params[6] is -6, params[7] is 6, and params[8] and [9] are 5 or 6. The highest rewards are 500.00, which are achieved by a few parameter sets.

But the user mentioned that if the reward is below 500, we should explore instead of exploiting. Since the current iteration is 246, maybe it's time to start exploring variations around the top parameters. However, the user also said to avoid previously seen params. So I need to tweak some parameters slightly.

Looking at the existing top params, maybe changing one of the parameters that's currently at the edge of the range. For example, params[2] is -5. Maybe increasing it to -4.5 or -4.7. Alternatively, params[4] is 5.3; perhaps adjusting that. Also, params[6] is -6, so maybe changing that to -5.5. But I have to ensure that the new parameters haven't been used before.

Wait, the user said to use a search step size of 1.0 during exploration. So if a parameter is at -5, adding or subtracting 1.0 would take it to -6 or -4. But looking at previous examples, some of these values have already been tried. For instance, params[2] was -5, -4, -6 in different examples. So maybe trying a different parameter.

Alternatively, looking at params[1], which is 2.3 in some cases and 1.3 in others. Maybe trying 3.3 or 0.3? But the user said to search both positive and negative values. However, the previous example with params[1] as 3.3 had a much lower reward (161.40), so that's probably not good. So maybe stick to values around 2.3 but adjust others.

Another approach: check which parameters have been varied less. For example, params[8] and [9] are mostly 5 or 6. Maybe increasing one of them to 6.5? Wait, no, the range is [-6.0, 6.0]. So 6 is the max. So maybe adjusting other parameters.

Wait, the user said that during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So if a parameter is at 6, maybe try 5.0 or 7.0, but 7.0 is out of bounds. So only 5.0. Similarly for -6, try -5.0.

Looking at the top params, let's take one of the 500.00 ones. For example:

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5.

Now, to explore, maybe change params[2] from -5 to -4 (but that was tried before, as in one of the examples with 499.95). Or change params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3? No, can't go beyond 6. So maybe 6.0. But that might not be helpful. Alternatively, change params[6] from -6 to -5. Let's try that.

So, new params would be:

params[0]:6, params[1]:2.3, params[2]:-5, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:6, params[6]:-5, params[7]:6, params[8]:5, params[9]:5.

But wait, this was tried before in one of the examples with f(params): 498.55. So that's already been tried. So need to find a new combination.

What about changing params[7] from 6 to 5? Let's see:

params[0]:6, params[1]:2.3, params[2]:-5, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:6, params[6]:-6, params[7]:5, params[8]:5, params[9]:5.

This hasn't been tried before. So this could be a new exploration step. Alternatively, changing params[8] from 5 to 6. But in some examples, params[8] is 6. Let's check if that's been tried. For example, in one of the 500.00 examples, params[8] is 5, but in another, params[8] is 6. So maybe changing params[8] to 6 and params[9] to 6. But that might be a new combination.

Wait, in one of the examples, params[8] and [9] are both 5, and another has them as 5 and 6. So trying to set both to 6. Let's see:

params[0]:6, params[1]:2.3, params[2]:-5, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:6, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:6, params[9]:6.

But this was tried before (params[8] and [9] as 6 and 6 in one example with f=497.35). So that's not new.

Hmm. Maybe changing params[1] from 2.3 to 3.3, but that had a lower reward. Alternatively, try a different parameter. What about params[3]? It's currently 6. Maybe change to 5.0? Let's try that.

params[0]:6, params[1]:2.3, params[2]:-5, params[3]:5, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:6, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:5, params[9]:5.

Wait, this was tried before with f=496.80. So not new.

Another approach: check which parameters have been varied. Maybe params[4] is 5.3. What if we set it to 4.3? But that was tried in an example with lower reward.

Alternatively, let's look for parameters that have been kept constant. For example, in the top examples, params[0] is always 6, params[1] is 2.3 or 1.3, params[2] is -5, -4, -6, etc. Maybe trying to vary params[1] to 3.3, but that's risky. Alternatively, trying to vary params[2] to -5.5 (but the step size is 1.0, so maybe -5.0 is already tried, so -6.0 is also tried. Maybe not helpful.

Wait, the user said during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So for parameters that are at the extremes, like 6 or -6, you can only move them by 1.0 in the opposite direction. For example, if a parameter is at 6, you can try 5.0. Similarly, if at -6, try -5.0.

Looking at params[6], which is -6 in some examples. So changing that to -5.0. Let's try that. So:

params[0]:6, params[1]:2.3, params[2]:-5, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:6, params[6]:-5, params[7]:6, params[8]:5, params[9]:5.

But this was tried before (f=498.55). So not new.

Another parameter to change: params[7] is 6. So changing to 5.0. Let's try that:

params[0]:6, params[1]:2.3, params[2]:-5, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:6, params[6]:-6, params[7]:5, params[8]:5, params[9]:5.

This hasn't been tried before. So this is a new exploration step. Let's go with that.
