SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 256 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to find the global optimal policy for the cartpole environment using this linear policy approach. The goal is to balance the pole on the cart within certain bounds. 

The parameters provided are W and B. W is a 4x10 matrix and B is a 10-dimensional vector. Each action is determined by taking the dot product of the state (which includes position, velocity, angle, and angular velocity) with W and then adding B. The reward is +1 each time step if the pole is upright and the cart is within bounds.

Looking at the parameters given, they seem to have values in a range from -6 to 6, which makes sense because the action space is just two discrete choices. 

One of the top performing parameters provided has an f(params) of 500, which is really high since the goal is to maintain balance. Other similar parameters also give around 493 or 450 rewards. These are pretty good but I need to see if there's a better set.

I remember that sometimes exploring other regions in parameter space can find even better solutions. Let me think about how to adjust these parameters slightly without making it too hard on the cartpole environment. Maybe increasing some angles and velocities could give a chance for the pole to balance better. 

Wait, the reward is based on the state being within bounds, so pushing more velocity towards zero or keeping the pole upright might be beneficial. Perhaps tweaking params[2] (angle) and params[3] (angular velocity) could help.

But I also have to be cautious not to overshoot because that could make the cart go out of bounds, which is bad. So maybe a balance between increasing angle, decreasing angular velocity, or keeping them at neutral levels.

Another thought: in some policies, having parameters that can move towards zero might help stabilize. But I'm not sure how W and B are structured here. Since W has negative values and positive ones, it's possible that certain combinations could lead to more stable behavior.

I also noticed that the parameter ranges are symmetric around 0, so maybe trying some slightly different numbers from this top performer set would yield better results.

Maybe adjusting params[2] up a bit and params[3] down a bit. For example, instead of -6/-4.5 for params[2], perhaps making it more balanced or even positive? Let me see how that affects the reward. 

Wait, if I make the pole angle less negative and increase angular velocity towards zero, maybe that could help balance. Or perhaps increasing the cart's position to keep it within bounds better.

Alternatively, starting from a lower reward (like 400) but seeing if tweaking other parameters can bring it up to around 500 or even higher. But I have to make sure not to make the cart go out of bounds too much.

I think trying some new parameter sets in the vicinity might help. For example, increasing params[2] a little and decreasing others as long as they don't break the balance. 

But how do I know if this is going to be better? Maybe running a few more experiments or using an optimization technique could give me a better idea. But for now, trying some different parameter sets in a small range around the top performer set seems like a reasonable next step.
