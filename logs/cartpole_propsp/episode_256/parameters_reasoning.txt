SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 256 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has provided a bunch of training examples with their corresponding episodic rewards. The goal is to find the optimal parameters for the linear policy in the CartPole environment. The current iteration is 256 out of 400, and the user wants me to suggest the next set of parameters.

Looking at the examples, the highest rewards are around 500. The top examples have params[0] and [3] at 6, params[2] and [6] at -5 or -6, and params[4] and [5] around 5.3 to 6. The bias terms (params[8] and [9]) are mostly 5 or 6. However, some variations in these parameters lead to lower rewards, like when params[7] is 5 instead of 6, or when params[2] is -4 instead of -5.

Since the user mentioned that the global optimum is around 500 and we need to explore rather than exploit if we're below that, but in the given examples, the maximum is already 500. However, the user might be suggesting that there's a better solution beyond that. Wait, the note says the global optimum should be around 500, but if we're below that, we should explore. But the examples already have some at 500.00. So maybe the current examples are near the maximum, but perhaps there's a way to tweak the parameters to get slightly higher.

Wait, the user's note says that if you are below 500, you should explore instead of exploit. But in the given examples, there are already entries with 500.00. So maybe the current best is 500, but the user is expecting us to find a better one. However, the note says the global optimum is around 500, so maybe 500 is the maximum. But the user might be indicating that there's a way to reach higher.

Alternatively, maybe the user is indicating that the global maximum is around 500, but the examples given have already reached that, so perhaps we need to explore variations around those parameters to see if we can get even higher. However, since the user's note says that if you are below 500, you should explore. But if you are at 500, maybe you should exploit. However, the user also says that the global optimum is around 500, so maybe that's the maximum.

But looking at the examples, the top ones are already at 500. So perhaps the next step is to explore nearby parameters. However, the user's instruction says that during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So maybe we should perturb the parameters by +/-1.0 from the current best.

Looking at the top examples, let's take the first one:

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5; f(params): 500.00

If we want to explore, we can try changing some parameters. For example, let's look at params[1], which is 2.3. Maybe increasing it by 1.0 to 3.3 or decreasing to 1.3. But in the examples, there's a case where params[1] is 1.3, but that led to lower rewards. Alternatively, maybe changing params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3? But the parameters are constrained to [-6.0, 6.0], so 6.3 is not allowed. So the maximum is 6.0.

Alternatively, let's check other parameters. For instance, params[2] is -5. Maybe changing it to -6.0. Let's see. In the examples, there's a case where params[2] is -6, but that had a lower reward (like 397.05). So maybe that's not good. Alternatively, params[6] is -6.0. Changing that to -5.0? But in another example, when params[6] was -5, the reward was 498.55, which is lower than 500. So that's worse.

What about the bias terms? params[8] and [9] are 5 and 5. Maybe increasing them to 6.0. Let's see. In one example, params[8] and [9] were 6 and 6, but that had a lower reward (like 497.35). So maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, looking at params[7], which is 6.0. Changing that to 5.0? But in another example, that led to lower reward. So maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe adjusting params[4] from 5.3 to 6.0. Let's see. In the first example, params[4] is 5.3. If we set it to 6.0, but in the second example, params[4] is 5.0, which had 500.00 as well. So maybe varying params[4] around that.

Alternatively, maybe looking at other parameters. For example, params[5] is 6.0. Could we change that? But in the examples, changing it didn't help much.

Wait, the user's instruction says during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So perhaps we need to take the current best parameters and perturb them by +/-1.0 in some parameters. But the current best is already at 500.00. So maybe we need to explore other parameters that haven't been tried yet.

Alternatively, maybe looking for parameters that are not in the current top examples. For example, maybe changing params[1] from 2.3 to 3.3 (adding 1.0). Let's try that. So:

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 3.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5.

This would be a new set of parameters, not seen before. Similarly, maybe changing params[2] from -5 to -4 (but that was tried in an example and had lower reward). Alternatively, changing params[4] from 5.3 to 4.3 (but that was also tried and had lower reward).

Alternatively, maybe changing params[8] from 5 to 6. So:

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 6; params[9]: 5.

This is a variation of the first example, changing params[8] to 6.0. Let's see if that's a new set. In the examples, there's one where params[8] and [9] were 6 and 6, but that had lower reward. However, this one only changes params[8] to 6 and leaves params[9] at 5. Maybe that's a new set.

Alternatively, maybe changing params[9] to 6.0. But that was tried in another example and had lower reward. So perhaps not.

Alternatively, looking for other parameters. For example, params[7] is 6.0. Maybe changing that to 5.0. But that was tried and had lower reward.

Hmm. Since the user says to explore with step size 1.0, and not to propose previously seen params, I need to find parameters that are different from the ones in the examples. Let's check the examples again to see which parameters are already tried.

Looking at the first example, params are:

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5.

Other examples have similar parameters but with small variations. So to explore, maybe changing one of the parameters by +/-1.0. For example, changing params[1] from 2.3 to 3.3 (adding 1.0), or to 1.3 (subtracting 1.0). But 1.3 was tried in another example and had lower reward. However, 3.3 hasn't been tried yet. Let's try that.

Another possibility is changing params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3 (but that's beyond the maximum of 6.0). So can't do that. Alternatively, changing params[4] to 4.3 (which was tried and had lower reward).

Alternatively, changing params[2] from -5 to -6 (which was tried and had lower reward). So maybe not.

Another parameter is params[7], which is 6.0. Changing that to 5.0 (but that was tried and had lower reward). So not helpful.

What about params[8] or [9]? Let's see. In the first example, they are 5 and 5. If we increase params[8] to 6.0, that's a new set. Let's try that.

So the new params would be:

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 6; params[9]: 5.

This hasn't been seen in the examples yet. Let's check the examples again. The user provided examples where params[8] and [9] were 6 and 6, but in that case, the reward was 497.35. However, this case changes only params[8] to 6 and leaves params[9] at 5. Maybe that's a new set.

Alternatively, changing params[9] to 6.0 while keeping params[8] at 5.0. That would be:

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 6.

This is a new set as well.

Alternatively, changing params[1] to 3.3. So:

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 3.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5.

This is a new set.

Another possibility is changing params[3] from 6.0 to 5.0. But that was tried in an example and had lower reward.

Alternatively, changing params[6] from -6.0 to -5.0. But that was tried and had lower reward.

So the best options for exploration are changing params[1], params[8], or params[9] by +/-1.0. Let's pick one of these. For example, changing params[8] to 6.0. That would be a new set and not seen before in the examples. Let's go with that.
