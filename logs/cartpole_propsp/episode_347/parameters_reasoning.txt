SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the optimal policy for the cartpole environment using reinforcement learning. The goal is to balance the pole as long as possible by pushing the cart left or right.

I remember that in this setup, each action (left or right push) is a parameter in the linear policy model. There are 10 parameters, and each one can be adjusted between -6 and 6 with one decimal place. The reward function gives +1 for every time step where the pole is upright and the cart stays within its safe zone.

The current setup uses f(params) which is the episodic reward of the policy. From the examples provided, I see that sometimes it's around 500. But the user wants to explore and reach a higher optimal value. The global optimum should be around 500, but the goal is to go beyond that.

So, looking at the parameters, I notice some params[3] values are set to 7. That seems high. Maybe that's where the policy can balance better. But I also see other negative values and combinations. It looks like there might be a mix of positive and negative slopes for the state features, which could lead the policy to both explore and exploit areas effectively.

I think about whether this approach is effective. Having some high rewards in certain states (like higher params[3]) might encourage exploration, allowing the model to learn more about those parameters when they're beneficial. But it's possible that other configurations might yield better results. Maybe I should try varying these parameters more to see if a different combination leads to a higher reward.

Another consideration is whether using multiple parameters in W and B can lead to more nuanced policy adjustments. Since the reward depends on each state feature, perhaps adjusting all of them together could create a better overall balance.

I also wonder about the starting points. The parameters are initially set between -6 and 6. Maybe if I start with higher values for params[3], it will explore that area first and then fine-tune with lower values elsewhere. But I'm not sure how sensitive each parameter is to changes in their weights.

Perhaps trying different combinations, like making some params positive and others negative, could balance the pole better without making any of them too extreme. It's a trade-off between exploration and exploitation here.

In summary, the parameters seem well-suited for exploration, but there might be a way to find a more optimal combination that leads to higher rewards. Maybe adjusting certain parameters more while keeping others manageable can help reach the global optimum.
