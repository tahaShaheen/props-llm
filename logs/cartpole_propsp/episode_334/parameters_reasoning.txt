SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 334 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what parameters to use for this cartpole environment. The goal is to get the pole upright and keep the cart within its boundaries. From the examples given, it looks like a reward of 500 seems pretty high, which suggests that those parameter values are doing really well.

Looking at the top performing params from iteration 3, I see parameters like -6 for W[1], 6 for W[2], and so on. The reward is around 500, which is a strong score. But wait, I remember reading somewhere that the maximum possible reward should be around 798 because it's about balancing without falling over. So if these params are giving such a high reward, they're probably near the optimal point.

Now, thinking about how the policy works—using a linear action space with W and B. The current parameters might be doing pretty well, but maybe there's room to tweak them a bit to improve further. I should consider values slightly higher or lower than those in the top performers to see if that helps. For example, tweaking params[0] up a little and others down could explore the parameter space more thoroughly.

Also, since it's a 4-dimensional state, each parameter affects different aspects of movement, pole angle, etc. Maybe adjusting some of them slightly could allow for better control in specific areas. I should make sure not to repeat previous parameter sets because that might cycle me through the same solutions without new learning.

I think starting by slightly adjusting params[0] and others around those values could be a good next step. It's within the 1 decimal place limit, so I need to pick numbers close enough to the current ones but maybe in a direction that leads to better rewards.
