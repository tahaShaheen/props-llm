SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to help find the optimal parameters for this cartpole environment. The goal is to balance the pole and keep the cart within its boundaries by choosing the best actions. 

First, I understand that the policy is a linear one with 18 parameters. These are organized in matrices W (4x2) and B (1x2). My task is to find the right values for params[0] through params[9] between -6 and 6 to maximize the episodic reward.

Looking at the examples provided, I see that some parameters like [0]:6, [1]:6, [2]:-3, etc., give a reward of around 500. Others have lower rewards or even negative ones. The best-performing params seem to cluster around certain values where the pole is balanced and cart is stable.

I notice that in one example, [3] is set to 7, which might be pushing the cart further. But I also see a -6 at [4], which could be keeping the cart from moving too much beyond the bounds. These actions balance each other out, preventing the pole from flipping or the cart from getting out of control.

The reward function gives +1 for every time step where the pole is upright and the cart is within bounds. So, the higher the reward, the better. In the examples with 500 reward, parameters seem to be set in a way that's pushing towards balance without causing immediate negative outcomes.

I'm thinking about how these parameters interact in W and B. The action is determined by state @ W + B. If I adjust these matrices, I can influence the policy's choices. But since the reward depends on the state over time (each step), it might require a more nuanced approach where the policy learns to adapt based on past states.

I remember that in reinforcement learning, one common method is Q-learning or SARSA. Since we're dealing with a linear policy, maybe using Q-learning would help update parameters based on the expected rewards. However, I'm not entirely sure how that translates into adjusting params[0] through [9].

Looking at the examples, some have higher actions like 7 and others have -6, which are within the specified range. So, balancing between positive and negative actions might be key to avoiding immediate negative outcomes while still pushing towards balance.

I also think about whether increasing certain parameters could lead to an immediate reward boost but might cause more instability in the next steps. Conversely, keeping them at neutral levels might prevent that and allow for better long-term stability.

Maybe I should start by setting some parameters high to encourage movement and others low to control the cart. For instance, having [4] as -6 could limit the cart's movement beyond the bounds, which would be good. But then, I need to make sure that pushing too hard isn't counterproductive in terms of balancing.

Overall, my approach should be to experiment with different combinations within the given range, evaluate how they affect the reward over time, and find a balance where the pole remains upright and the cart stays within bounds without causing negative outcomes immediately. This iterative process might involve adjusting parameters, observing the resulting rewards, and making adjustments based on feedback.
