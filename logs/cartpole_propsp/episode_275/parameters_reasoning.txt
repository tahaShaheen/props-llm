SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 275 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is working on optimizing a linear policy for the CartPole environment. They've provided a bunch of previous parameter sets and their corresponding rewards. The goal is to reach the global optimum, which they mention should be around 500. The current iteration is 275 out of 400, so there's still time to explore.

Looking at the examples, the top-performing params have some patterns. For instance, params[0] and [3] are often 6, while params[2] and [6] are frequently -5 or -6. The bias terms (params[8] and [9]) are around 5. The rewards for these top params are all around 500, which is the target. However, some variations, like changing params[2] to -4 or -6, result in lower rewards, indicating that the current values are near the optimal.

The user's instruction says to explore both positive and negative values with a step size of 1.0 during exploration. Since the current params are already near the top, maybe tweaking some parameters that haven't been changed much could help. For example, params[7] in some cases is 5 instead of 6. Maybe increasing that to 6 could improve the reward. Also, looking at the last example, params[7] was 5, and the reward was 497.05, which is slightly lower than 500. So changing that back to 6 might help.

Another thing to check is params[1]. In some cases, it's 2.3, but in one example, it's 1.3 or 3.3, which resulted in lower rewards. So keeping it around 2.3 seems better. Also, params[4] is often 5.3, and changing that to 4.3 or 5.3 affects the reward. So maybe keeping params[4] at 5.3 is good.

Looking at the bias terms, params[8] and [9] are mostly 5. In one case, they were 6, which led to a lower reward. So keeping them at 5 might be better. However, in another example, changing params[8] to 6 and [9] to 6 gave a lower reward, so maybe 5 is better.

So the current best params are around:

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 2.3, params[2]: -5, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 5.3, params[5]: 6, params[6]: -6, params[7]: 6, params[8]: 5, params[9]: 5.

But the user wants to avoid previously seen params. The first example had params[6] as -6 and params[7] as 6. However, in one of the examples, params[7] was 5, which gave a lower reward. So maybe trying to adjust params[7] back to 6 could help. Also, checking if any other parameters can be adjusted with a step of 1.0. For example, params[2] is -5; trying -6 or -4. But previous examples show that -5 is better. Similarly, params[6] is -6; trying -5 might not be good as that led to lower rewards.

Alternatively, maybe adjusting params[5] from 6 to 5 or 7 (but 7 is beyond the range). Since the range is [-6,6], 6 is the max. So maybe keeping that as 6.

Another parameter to check is params[4], which is 5.3. If we try 6.3, but that's outside the range. So maybe 5.3 is optimal. 

So the best approach is to take the current top-performing params and make small adjustments where possible. Since the user wants exploration, maybe changing one parameter that's on the edge. For example, params[7] was 5 in one case, but changing it back to 6. Or maybe adjusting params[2] from -5 to -4.5, but the step size is 1.0, so maybe -5 is already the best. 

Alternatively, looking at the last example where params[7] was 5 and the reward was 497.05, which is lower than the 500. So changing params[7] back to 6 could be beneficial. So modifying that parameter. 

So the new params could be:

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 2.3, params[2]: -5, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 5.3, params[5]: 6, params[6]: -6, params[7]: 6, params[8]: 5, params[9]: 5.

Wait, but that's the same as the first example. The user said not to propose previously seen params. So need to find a new set. Maybe adjust params[8] or [9] slightly. For example, params[8] is 5, so changing to 6 or 4. But in previous examples, changing to 6 gave lower rewards. So maybe 4? Let's see. If I change params[8] to 4, but that's a step of 1.0. However, the previous example had params[8] as 6 and [9] as 6, which was worse. So perhaps adjusting params[8] to 4 might not be good. Alternatively, changing params[9] to 6. But again, that might not be good. 

Alternatively, looking at params[2], which is -5. If I change it to -6, but in one example that led to lower reward. So maybe not. What about params[6] is -6. If I change that to -5? But that was tried and gave lower reward. 

Hmm. Maybe look for parameters that haven't been changed much. For example, params[1] is 2.3. What if I adjust it to 3.3 or 1.3? But previous examples show that 3.3 gives lower reward. So maybe 2.3 is better. 

Another idea: check if any of the other parameters can be adjusted. For example, params[5] is 6. What if we lower it to 5? But that's a step of 1.0. Let's see. In the first example, params[5] is 6, and changing it to 5 might lower the reward. But maybe not. However, since the user wants exploration, even if it's a small step, we can try. 

Alternatively, adjust params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3 (but that's outside the range). So not possible. 

Alternatively, check if any of the other parameters can be adjusted. For example, params[0] is 6. Can't go higher. Maybe lower to 5? But that might reduce the reward. 

This is tricky. Since the user wants exploration with a step size of 1.0, but the current top params are already near the maximum. Maybe the best way is to perturb one parameter that's on the edge. For example, params[7] was 5 in one case, so changing it back to 6. But that's already in the first example. So need to find a new combination. 

Wait, looking at the first example: params[0] to [9] are 6, 2.3, -5, 6, 5.3, 6, -6, 6, 5, 5. That's the first example. The user said not to repeat that. So maybe change one parameter slightly. For example, change params[8] from 5 to 6. So:

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 2.3, params[2]: -5, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 5.3, params[5]: 6, params[6]: -6, params[7]: 6, params[8]: 6, params[9]: 5.

But in one example, when params[8] was 6 and [9] was 6, the reward was lower. However, changing only [8] to 6 and keeping [9] at 5 might be different. Let's try that. 

Alternatively, change params[9] from 5 to 6. So:

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 2.3, params[2]: -5, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 5.3, params[5]: 6, params[6]: -6, params[7]: 6, params[8]: 5, params[9]: 6.

But again, need to check if this has been tried. In the examples, there was a case where params[8] and [9] were 6, which gave lower reward. So maybe this is a new combination. 

Alternatively, adjust params[2] from -5 to -6. But that was tried and gave lower reward. So probably not. 

Another approach: check if any parameters have not been explored enough. For example, params[7] was 5 in one case. Changing it to 6 again. But that's already in the first example. 

Wait, maybe adjust params[6] from -6 to -5. But in previous examples, that led to lower rewards. So not helpful. 

Alternatively, look for parameters that have not been varied much. For example, params[4] is 5.3. What if we change it to 6.3? No, that's out of range. So 5.3 is the max. 

Hmm. Maybe the best option is to try changing params[8] or [9] slightly. Since the user wants exploration, even if it's a small step. Let's go with changing params[8] to 6 and keeping [9] at 5. That's a new combination not seen before. So the new params would be:

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 2.3, params[2]: -5, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 5.3, params[5]: 6, params[6]: -6, params[7]: 6, params[8]: 6, params[9]: 5.
