SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 274 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of training examples with their corresponding rewards. The goal is to find the optimal parameters for the linear policy in the CartPole environment. The current iteration is 274 out of 400, and they want me to suggest the next set of parameters.

Looking at the examples, the highest rewards are around 500. The top examples have params[0] at 6, params[1] around 2.3, params[2] around -5, params[3] at 6, params[4] around 5.3, params[5] at 6, params[6] around -6, params[7] at 6, and params[8] and [9] around 5. But some variations here and there lead to slightly lower rewards. 

The user mentioned that if the current reward is below 500, we should explore instead of exploit. The last example given has a reward of 472.60, which is below 500. So, we need to explore more. The exploration step size is 1.0, so we should adjust parameters by +/-1.0 from the current ones. 

Looking at the parameters in the last example (params[0]:6, params[1]:2.3, etc.), maybe we can tweak some of the lower ones. For instance, params[2] is -5. If we increase it by 1.0 to -4, or decrease to -6. Similarly, check params[4] which is 5.3. Maybe adjusting that to 6.3 or 4.3. Also, params[6] is -6; maybe changing that to -5 or -7. But since the range is [-6.0, 6.0], -7 isn't allowed. So only -5. 

But wait, the user said to search both positive and negative values. So perhaps try changing some parameters that are at the edge. For example, params[0] is already at 6.0, so can't go higher. Maybe lower it to 5.0. Similarly, params[3] is 6.0, so maybe lower to 5.0. 

Another approach: look for parameters that might be underexplored. For example, in the examples, params[8] and [9] are mostly around 5 or 6. Maybe trying lower values here. But the previous example with params[8] and [9] at 6 gave a lower reward (495.70). So perhaps decreasing them back to 5. 

Wait, but the user says during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So take the current best parameters (the ones with 500 reward) and perturb them by +/-1.0 in some parameters. Let's pick one of the top parameters, like the first one: params[0]:6, params[1]:2.3, params[2]:-5, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:6, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:5, params[9]:5. 

Now, let's perturb some parameters. For example, params[2] is -5. Adding 1.0 makes it -4.0. Or subtracting 1.0 makes it -6.0. But in the examples, params[2] at -6 gives lower reward. So maybe try -4.0. Similarly, params[4] is 5.3. Adding 1.0 makes it 6.3, but since the max is 6.0, that's not allowed. So maybe 5.3 + 0.7? Wait, but the step size is 1.0. So perhaps 5.3 + 1.0 would be 6.3, which is beyond 6.0. So maybe adjust to 6.0. Or maybe decrease to 4.3. 

Alternatively, look at params[6], which is -6.0. Since it's already at the lower bound, can't decrease further. Maybe increase to -5.0. 

Another parameter to consider is params[7], which is 6.0. Maybe decrease to 5.0. 

Also, params[8] and [9] are 5.0. Maybe increase them to 6.0. 

So, let's try modifying params[2] from -5 to -4, params[6] from -6 to -5, and params[7] from 6 to 5. That would be a step in each direction. 

So the new params would be:

params[0]:6, params[1]:2.3, params[2]:-4, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:6, params[6]:-5, params[7]:5, params[8]:5, params[9]:5. 

But wait, in the examples, there was a similar set with params[6] at -5 and params[7] at 6, but that had a lower reward. Maybe trying other combinations. Alternatively, change params[4] from 5.3 to 6.0 (since 5.3 + 0.7 is 6.0, but step size is 1.0. So maybe that's not allowed. Hmm. 

Alternatively, change params[1] from 2.3 to 3.3 (adding 1.0) or 1.3 (subtracting 1.0). The example with params[1] at 3.3 had lower reward, but maybe trying that again. 

Alternatively, change params[8] and [9] from 5 to 6. 

Another thought: the current best is 500, but maybe there's a way to get higher. Since the user says the global optimum should be around 500, but maybe there's a way to reach 500. However, the examples already have some at 500. So perhaps the next step is to explore nearby parameters. 

But since the user says if below 500, explore. The last example given is 472.60, which is below 500. So we need to explore. Let's take a parameter that's in the top examples (like the first one with 500) and perturb it. Let's take the first example: params[0]:6, params[1]:2.3, params[2]:-5, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:6, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:5, params[9]:5. 

Now, let's change params[2] from -5 to -4 (adding 1.0). Also, change params[6] from -6 to -5 (adding 1.0). And change params[7] from 6 to 5 (subtracting 1.0). That would be three changes. 

So the new params would be:

params[0]:6; params[1]:2.3; params[2]:-4; params[3]:6; params[4]:5.3; params[5]:6; params[6]:-5; params[7]:5; params[8]:5; params[9]:5. 

This is a new set of parameters that haven't been tried before. Let's check if this is within the allowed range. All parameters are within [-6.0, 6.0]. 

Another possibility is to change params[1] from 2.3 to 3.3 (adding 1.0), but that might not be as effective. 

Alternatively, change params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3 (but that's beyond 6.0, so adjust to 6.0). 

But the step size is 1.0, so perhaps that's not allowed. So maybe stick with the first idea of changing params[2], [6], and [7]. 

I think that's a good candidate for exploration. Let's go with that.
