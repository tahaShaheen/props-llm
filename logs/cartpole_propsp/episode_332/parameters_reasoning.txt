SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 332 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has provided a bunch of previous params and their corresponding rewards. The goal is to find the optimal policy parameters that maximize the episodic reward. The current iteration is 332 out of 400, so there's still some time left. The examples given all have rewards around 500, which the user mentioned is the global optimum. But some of the params are slightly lower, like 499.95 or 498.55. 

Looking at the top params, most of them have params[0] and params[1] set to 6 and 2.3, params[2] and [3] as -5 and 6, params[4] and [5] around 5.3 and 6, params[6] and [7] as -6 and 6, and params[8] and [9] as 5. However, some variations in these values lead to lower rewards. For example, changing params[2] to -4 or params[4] to 4.3 results in lower rewards. Also, changing params[6] to -5 or params[7] to 5 reduces the reward. 

The user mentioned that during exploration, a search step size of 1.0 should be used. Since we're near the maximum iterations, maybe we should explore nearby values. The current top params have params[8] as 5 and params[9] as 5. Maybe adjusting these slightly could help. Also, looking at the params that had lower rewards, like when params[8] was 4 or 5.1, the reward dropped. So keeping params[8] and [9] around 5 seems good. 

Another thing to check is params[2] and [3]. In some cases, params[2] was -5 and [3] 6, which were part of the top rewards. Maybe trying other values here, but since they are already at the extremes (-5 and 6), changing them might not help. Similarly, params[0] and [1] are at 6 and 2.3. Maybe adjusting params[1] a bit, like to 1.3 or 3.3, but in the examples, when params[1] was 1.3, the reward was lower. So perhaps keeping params[1] at 2.3 is better. 

Also, looking at params[4] and [5], they are around 5.3 and 6. Maybe trying 5.4 or 5.2. But in the examples, when params[4] was 5.4, the reward was 498.9, which is slightly lower than 500. So maybe the optimal is around 5.3. 

Since the user wants to avoid previously seen params, I need to make sure that the new params are not exactly the same as those listed. For example, in the first example, params[0] to [9] are all set to certain values. So maybe adjusting one of the parameters by a small step. Let's say, changing params[8] from 5 to 5.1 or 4.9. But since the step size is 1.0, maybe changing by 1.0. Wait, the user said during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. But the parameters are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place. So maybe adding or subtracting 1.0 to some parameters. 

Looking at the current top params, maybe trying to adjust params[8] or [9] by 1.0. For example, if params[8] is 5, changing it to 6 or 4. But in the examples, when params[8] was 4, the reward was lower. Alternatively, adjusting params[6] from -6 to -5. But in one of the examples, when params[6] was -5, the reward was 498.55. So maybe not. 

Alternatively, looking at params[7], which is 6 in most top examples. Changing that to 5. But that might lower the reward. 

Alternatively, check if any parameters are not at the extremes. For example, params[1] is 2.3. Maybe trying 3.3 or 1.3. But in the examples, when params[1] was 1.3, the reward was lower. So perhaps increasing it. But 2.3 is already a value in the middle. 

Another approach: since the current top params have params[0] as 6, which is the maximum, and params[3] as 6, which is also maximum. Maybe trying to decrease those slightly. But without knowing the exact function, it's hard to say. 

Alternatively, check the parameters that are not at the extremes. For example, params[4] is 5.3. Maybe trying 5.3 + 1.0 = 6.3? But the maximum is 6.0. So can't go beyond that. So maybe 5.3 is already near the upper limit. 

Hmm. Maybe the best approach is to slightly perturb one of the parameters that are not at the extremes. For example, params[8] is 5. Changing it to 5.5 or 4.5. Let's try 5.5. But since the step size is 1.0, maybe adding or subtracting 1.0. So 5 + 1.0 = 6.0. Let's try that. So changing params[8] from 5 to 6.0. Let's see. 

But in the examples, when params[8] was 5 and params[9] was 5, the reward was 500. So changing params[8] to 6 might be a new parameter set. Let's try that. So the new params would be:

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 6; params[9]: 5. 

But I need to check if this has been tried before. Looking at the previous examples, the first one had params[8] as 5 and params[9] as 5. The others had similar. So this new set with params[8] as 6 and [9] as 5 hasn't been tried yet. 

Alternatively, changing params[9] to 6.0. Let's try that. 

But I need to make sure that the parameters are within [-6.0, 6.0]. So 6.0 is allowed. 

Another possibility is to adjust params[4] from 5.3 to 6.0. Let's see. If params[4] is 6.0, and others are same. 

But again, need to check if that's been done. Looking at the examples, in the first one, params[4] was 5.3. So changing it to 6.0 would be a new param. 

But since the user says to use a step size of 1.0 during exploration, maybe adding or subtracting 1.0 to some parameters. For example, if params[4] is 5.3, adding 1.0 would be 6.3, which is over the limit. So can't do that. Subtracting 1.0 would be 4.3, which was tried and gave lower reward. 

Hmm. Maybe trying to adjust params[2] from -5 to -6. Since it's allowed. Let's see. In the examples, params[2] was -5. Changing it to -6. So the new params would be:

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -6; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5. 

This hasn't been tried before. Let's check the previous examples. The first few examples have params[2] as -5. So this is a new parameter. 

Alternatively, adjusting params[6] from -6 to -5. But that was tried and gave lower reward. 

Another idea: looking at params[7], which is 6 in the top examples. Maybe changing that to 5. But that might lower the reward. 

Alternatively, check if any parameters are not at the extremes. For example, params[1] is 2.3. Maybe trying 3.3. Let's see. Changing params[1] to 3.3. But in the examples, when params[1] was 1.3, the reward was lower. So maybe increasing it. 

But the user says to explore, so trying different values. 

But given that the current top rewards are around 500, and the user says the global optimum is around 500, maybe the current params are already near optimal. However, the user also says that if below 500, it's a local optimum and we should explore. Since the current examples have some at 500.00, but others slightly lower. 

But since we're at iteration 332, maybe we need to make a move. Let's pick one parameter to adjust. For example, changing params[8] from 5 to 6.0. Let's try that. So the new params would be as follows.
