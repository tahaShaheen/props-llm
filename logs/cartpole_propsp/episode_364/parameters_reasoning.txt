SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 364 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm looking at this problem about improving a cartpole environment using reinforcement learning. The goal is to find the parameters of a linear policy that maximize the episodic reward.

First, let me understand the setup. The cartpole is a classic environment where pushing the cart or pole over results in an episode ending. The state has four elements: cart position, velocity, pole angle, and angular velocity. The actions are pushing left (0) or right (1). 

The policy is linear with 18 parameters derived from a 4x4 matrix W and a vector B. The reward function is positive when the pole is upright and the cart is within bounds.

So, in my training examples, I'm providing specific values for params[0] through params[9]. My goal is to find their optimal values that maximize f(params), which is the expected reward over an episode.

Looking at the existing best-performing parameters, like [6, 6, -3, 6], etc., they achieve a reward of 500. Now, I need to adjust these params around this region since it's already quite high.

I should start by considering how each parameter affects the reward. For example, W[0][0] and W[1][0] relate to cart position and velocity affecting the next state. So, increasing these might make the system respond faster, possibly reducing pole inversion. On the other hand, B[0] is a constant added to the action, so it could be contributing positively.

But I also need to think about the reward function: +1 every time step where pole upright and cart within bounds. If W increases too much, pushing the cart might make it move faster, which is bad if it goes out of bounds or causes the pole to tip. Similarly, making W negative could slow down movement, but then again, that's counterintuitive because perhaps a steeper slope makes things go off.

I should also consider B[0] and B[1]. These are added from the actions. Since action is 0 or 1, adding them might increase reward each time step if both W parameters are positive, but I need to balance that with the state transitions making pole upright.

Maybe a good approach is to experiment with small changes around existing optimal values. For example, increasing some W elements slightly and decreasing others, while keeping B as they are or adjusting accordingly.

Let me also think about how each parameter affects the velocity component of the state. If params[1] is too high, it might cause the cart to move faster than needed, leading to pole inversion if not countered by negative W elements. Similarly,params[2], which affects the pole angle, should be carefully controlled.

Perhaps I'll start by adjusting params[0] (cart position) and params[2] (pole angle). If these are too positive or too negative, it could cause instability in the system. For instance, if cart velocity is too high (params[1]), maybe pushing left more might help stabilize, but that depends on how W parameters balance it.

Also, I should ensure that the pole doesn't tip over beyond 0.418 radians. So any changes to params[3] or [2] must prevent this, which could require negative W elements if the system is too unstable.

The reward at these current points is 500, so my adjustments shouldn't bring it below that unless I can find a path with higher rewards through different policy parameters.

I'll also have to be cautious about not revisiting parameters from previous iterations since I need to explore around this region without getting stuck in local maxima. So perhaps I should make small, incremental changes and evaluate the results each time before making significant adjustments.

Maybe implementing an exploration strategy where I vary one parameter at a time and check how it affects the reward can guide me towards an optimal set. That way, I can see if increasing W[0][0] leads to better rewards without causing too much instability.

Another thought: since B is added from the actions, perhaps both params[0] (W[0][0]) and params[1] (W[2][0], maybe) influence this. If I increase one while decreasing another, it might balance out but keep the reward steady.

Wait, in the current setup, W is a 4x4 matrix where each row corresponds to an action. So for W, the first row would correspond to pushing left (action 0), and the second row to pushing right (action 1). Each element affects the next state's cart position or velocity.

So params[0] = W[0][0], which is the weight for the previous state's cart position in determining the current action. If this parameter is too high, it might make the system respond quickly to changes in cart position, possibly overshooting and causing the pole to tip over or the cart to go out of bounds.

Similarly, params[3] (W[0][3], which affects the angular velocity) could also contribute to instability if it's not balanced by negative W elements elsewhere.

I should probably focus on adjusting these parameters carefully. Maybe I'll try small increments and decrements around existing optimal values to see how they affect the reward.

Also, considering that B is added once per action, perhaps the constants can be tuned to optimize the baseline reward without being too influenced by the policy's dynamics.

In summary, my plan is to:
1. Vary each parameter individually while keeping others fixed.
2. Evaluate the resulting f(params) after each adjustment.
3. Keep track of parameters that maintain a reward around 500 or higher to avoid getting stuck in local maxima.
4. Gradually make larger adjustments only when necessary, based on how each parameter's influence changes the reward.

I'll start by adjusting params[0] (W[0][0]) a bit. If increasing it leads to better rewards without destabilizing the system, I might push it higher. Similarly, lowering it could help if it makes pole inversion worse. Then move to other parameters in a similar fashion.
