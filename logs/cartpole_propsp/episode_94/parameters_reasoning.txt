SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 94 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.

WARNING: This is attempt 2 out of 10. You have FAILED 1 times already. You have 8 attempts remaining. MAKE SURE THE FORMAT IS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT: 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, ...' with all values in range [-6.0, 6.0]. If you fail again, the entire episode will be discarded.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is working on optimizing a linear policy for the CartPole environment. The current iteration is 94 out of 400, and they've provided some examples of previous parameters and their corresponding rewards. The goal is to reach a maximum reward around 500, but so far the highest seen is 492.00.

First, I need to analyze the existing parameters. Looking at the top examples, many of them have params[0] and params[1] set to 6 and 1.3, respectively. The other parameters vary, but some common patterns are params[2] and params[3] being -6 and 6, and similar for params[6] and params[7]. The bias terms (params[8] and params[9]) are often 6. However, the highest reward here is 492, which is close to 500 but not quite there.

The user mentioned that during exploration, a step size of 1.0 should be used. So maybe I should perturb the existing parameters by ±1.0 in some of the dimensions. But I need to avoid repeating previous parameters. Let's check which parameters have been tried. For example, in the first example, params[0] is 6, params[1] is 1.3, params[2] is -6, etc. So perhaps varying some of the other parameters that haven't been explored as much.

Looking at the parameters that might be underexplored: params[4], params[5], params[6], params[7], and the bias terms. For instance, in some examples, params[4] is 5.3 or 6, but maybe trying lower values could help. Also, the bias terms are mostly 6, but maybe adjusting them could improve the reward.

Another thing to consider is the structure of the policy. The action is determined by the maximum of the linear combination of the state with W and B. So, the weights W and the bias B determine how the state variables influence the action. To balance the pole, the policy needs to respond appropriately to the cart's position, velocity, pole angle, and angular velocity.

Perhaps the current parameters are too high in some areas, leading to overfitting or not enough exploration. Trying to lower some of the weights that are currently at 6 or -6 might allow for better generalization. For example, params[2] is -6 in many cases. Maybe increasing it slightly to -5 or -4 could help.

Also, looking at the parameters that have lower values. For example, in some cases, params[4] is 4.3 or 5.3. Maybe increasing that could have a positive effect. However, since the user mentioned that the global optimum is around 500, and the current best is 492, there's still room for improvement.

I should generate a new set of parameters that vary from the existing ones. Let's take the top-performing example (params[0]:6, params[1]:1.3, params[2]:-6, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:5.7, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:6, params[9]:6) and perturb some of the parameters by ±1.0. For instance, changing params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3 (but wait, the maximum allowed is 6.0). So maybe 6.0. Alternatively, decreasing it to 4.3. Wait, but that's already been tried. Alternatively, changing params[5] from 5.7 to 6.7, but again, the max is 6.0. So maybe 6.0. Or perhaps adjusting other parameters like params[2] from -6 to -5, but that's already been done in some examples.

Alternatively, looking at other parameters that haven't been varied much. For example, params[1] is consistently 1.3. Maybe trying 0.3 or 2.3. But in one of the examples, params[1] was 0.3 and the reward was lower. However, maybe trying 2.3 could help. But in one example, when params[1] was 2.3, the reward was 277, which is much lower. So that's probably not a good direction.

Alternatively, looking at params[8] and params[9], which are mostly 6. Maybe lowering them to 5.0 or 4.0. But in some examples, when they were lowered to 5, the reward was lower. However, perhaps there's a sweet spot.

Another approach is to look for parameters that have been underexplored. For example, in the examples provided, params[4] is sometimes 5.3, 6, 4.3, 5.3. Maybe trying 5.7 or 5.0. Similarly, params[5] is 5.7, 5.7, 4.7, etc. Maybe varying those.

Alternatively, considering that the current best has params[4] at 5.3 and params[5] at 5.7. Perhaps increasing params[4] to 5.7 and params[5] to 6.0. Let's try that. Also, maybe adjusting the bias terms. For example, params[8] and params[9] could be 5.0 instead of 6.0. But need to check if that's allowed. The range is [-6.0, 6.0], so 5.0 is allowed.

Putting this together, a possible new set of parameters could be:

params[0]:6, params[1]:1.3, params[2]:-6, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.7, params[5]:6.0, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:5.0, params[9]:5.0. This changes params[4] and params[5] and lowers the bias terms. This hasn't been tried before in the examples given, so it's a new set. Also, the step size is 1.0 for some parameters (like params[4] increased by 0.4 from 5.3 to 5.7, but that's less than 1.0. Maybe better to do a larger step. For example, increasing params[4] to 6.0 (max allowed) and params[5] to 6.0, and lowering the bias terms to 5.0. That would be a step size of 1.0 for the bias terms (from 6 to 5) and 0.7 for params[4] and 0.3 for params[5]. But maybe that's acceptable.

Alternatively, another variation: keeping params[4] at 5.3, but changing params[5] to 6.0, and adjusting other parameters. Let's try that. Also, maybe adjusting params[6] from -6 to -5. But that's already been tried in some examples.

Hmm. The user said to explore both positive and negative values. So perhaps trying some negative values for parameters that are currently positive. For example, params[3] is 6 in many cases. Maybe lowering it to 5.0. But in some examples, when params[3] was 5, the reward was lower. However, maybe combining that with other changes.

Alternatively, looking at the parameters that have been tried and seeing which ones are not yet varied. For example, params[6] is -6 in many cases. Maybe trying -5.0 or -7.0 (but the range is up to -6.0). So -5.0. But that's already been tried in some examples.

This is a bit tricky. The key is to generate a new set of parameters that haven't been tried before, with a step size of 1.0 in some dimensions. Let's pick a few parameters to change. Let's take the top example and change params[4] from 5.3 to 6.0 (step +0.7), params[5] from 5.7 to 6.0 (step +0.3), and params[8] and params[9] from 6.0 to 5.0 (step -1.0). This would be a new set of parameters not seen before. Let's check if that's allowed. Yes, all values are within [-6.0, 6.0]. So the new parameters would be:

params[0]:6, params[1]:1.3, params[2]:-6, params[3]:6, params[4]:6.0, params[5]:6.0, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:5.0, params[9]:5.0.

This is a new set not previously seen, and it's exploring higher values for params[4] and params[5], and lower for the bias terms. This could potentially lead to a higher reward.
