SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 90 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is working on optimizing a linear policy for the CartPole environment. They've provided a bunch of previous parameter values and their corresponding rewards. The goal is to find the global optimum, which they mention should be around 500. The current examples have rewards up to 491.70, so there's still room for improvement.

Looking at the top params, many of them have params[0] and params[1] set to 6 and 1.3, respectively. The other parameters vary, but some common patterns are params[2] and params[6] being -6, while params[3] and params[7] are 6. The bias terms params[8] and params[9] are often 6. However, the highest reward here is 491.70, which is close to 500 but not quite there.

Since the user mentioned that if we're below 500, we should explore instead of exploit. The exploration step size is 1.0. So maybe we need to perturb some parameters that are currently at their extremes. For example, params[0] is at 6, which is the upper bound. Maybe decreasing it a bit could help. Similarly, params[2] is -6; increasing it might be beneficial. Also, looking at the bias terms, they are all 6. Maybe adjusting those could help.

But we need to make sure not to repeat previous params. The user emphasized that. So I need to check the existing ones. For instance, the first example has params[0] and [1] as 6 and 1.3, and others as -6, 6, etc. Maybe trying different values for params[1], like 0.3 or 2.3, but the user has already tried some of those. Wait, the 15th example had params[1] as 2.3, but that gave a lower reward.

Another approach is to look for parameters that might be underexplored. For example, in the current top params, params[4] and [5] are around 5.3 and 5.7. Maybe increasing those could help. But since the step size is 1.0 during exploration, perhaps trying to adjust some of these parameters by +/-1.0.

Wait, the user says during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So if we're exploring, we should take steps of 1.0 from the current values. But the current top params have some parameters at 6.0. If we take a step of -1.0, that would be 5.0. Similarly, parameters at -6.0 could be increased by 1.0 to -5.0.

Looking at the first example: params[0] is 6.0, params[1] is 1.3, params[2] is -6.0, params[3] is 6.0, params[4] is 5.3, params[5] is 5.7, params[6] is -6.0, params[7] is 6.0, params[8] is 6.0, params[9] is 6.0. The reward is 491.70. Maybe trying to adjust params[0] to 5.0 (a step down of 1.0), and params[2] to -5.0 (a step up of 1.0). Also, maybe adjusting the bias terms. For example, params[8] and [9] are 6.0; perhaps reducing them to 5.0.

Alternatively, looking at the other parameters, maybe increasing params[1] from 1.3 to 2.3 (as in one of the examples), but that gave a lower reward. Hmm, but maybe with other parameter changes.

Another thought: the policy is a linear function, so the weights and biases determine the action. The action is the argmax of the linear combination. To keep the pole upright, the policy needs to apply the right force when the pole is tilting. So maybe the weights related to the pole angle (params[4] and [5]) are important. If those are too high, maybe the policy is overreacting. But in the current examples, they are around 5.3 and 5.7, which are high. Maybe adjusting those could help.

But since the user is suggesting exploration with step size 1.0, perhaps trying to adjust some parameters. Let's pick a parameter that's at the upper bound (6.0) and decrease it by 1.0, and a parameter at lower bound (-6.0) and increase it by 1.0. For example, params[0] is 6.0, so decrease to 5.0. params[2] is -6.0, increase to -5.0. Similarly, params[3] is 6.0, decrease to 5.0. params[6] is -6.0, increase to -5.0. Also, maybe adjust the bias terms from 6.0 to 5.0. That would be a step in each direction.

So the new params would be:

params[0]: 5.0 (from 6.0 -1.0)
params[1]: 1.3 (unchanged for now)
params[2]: -5.0 (from -6.0 +1.0)
params[3]: 5.0 (from 6.0 -1.0)
params[4]: 5.3 (unchanged)
params[5]: 5.7 (unchanged)
params[6]: -5.0 (from -6.0 +1.0)
params[7]: 5.0 (from 6.0 -1.0)
params[8]: 5.0 (from 6.0 -1.0)
params[9]: 5.0 (from 6.0 -1.0)

This would be a new set of parameters that's different from the previous ones. The idea is to explore by adjusting parameters that were at the extremes, moving them inward. This might lead to a better reward. Also, since the user mentioned that the global optimum is around 500, and the current best is 491.70, this exploration step might help get closer.
