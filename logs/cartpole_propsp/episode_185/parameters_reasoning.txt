SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help with this cartpole environment where the goal is to balance a pole on a cart. The state includes the cart's position, velocity, pole angle, and angular velocity. The action space is either pushing left or right.

I remember that using a linear policy like the one described might not be the best approach for this problem because it doesn't consider the current state of the system effectively. Maybe I should look into more advanced policy gradient methods or other reinforcement learning techniques that could handle such tasks better, especially since cartpole is known to be difficult and often used as a benchmark.

Looking at the parameters provided, there are 10 values between -6.0 and 6.0 with one decimal place each. The goal is around 500, so it's looking for a good set of parameters that maximize the episodic reward. 

I should probably try different combinations of these parameters to see how they affect the reward. Maybe I can start by adjusting some key parameters like params[0] and params[1], which control the cart's position. Lowering them might make it harder for the pole to stay upright, so maybe those should be lower than 0.

Looking at the top-performing parameters mentioned earlier, they have a lot of negative values except for some that seem less extreme. For example, some have -2.5 or even lower in params[8] and [9], which are related to pushing left and right. That might be beneficial because it allows flexibility in moving the cart around.

I should also consider whether pushing too hard (higher values) would make it impossible for the pole to stay upright since it could cause the cart to move too quickly or get stuck. So maybe parameters like params[0] and [1] shouldn't be too high in magnitude but still within the allowed range.

Perhaps I can try to balance out these values, ensuring that each parameter isn't too positive or negative relative to others. This might help in finding a sweet spot where both pushing left and right is balanced enough to keep the pole upright while keeping the cart stable.

I could also experiment with different ranges for params[0] and [1]. If I set them higher than -4.5, would that make it easier to push the pole up? Maybe, but then the cart might move too quickly, which could destabilize things if not balanced correctly.

Another thought is whether increasing some parameters beyond others might help in certain aspects of balancing or pushing the pole. For example, params[2] and [4] control the pole angle, so maybe adjusting these can influence how the pole resists tipping over the cart. Higher values there could make it harder for the pole to stay upright, which isn't ideal.

I should probably try some experiments. Maybe I'll adjust params[0] and [1], keep them around -4.5, and see what happens with a lower range in others like params[2] and [4]. It might take several iterations of this process, but it's worth exploring to find the optimal balance.
