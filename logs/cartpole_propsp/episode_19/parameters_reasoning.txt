SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is working on optimizing a linear policy for the CartPole environment. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward, which they mentioned should be around 500. The current examples show that the highest reward so far is 293.85. But the user wants to reach 500, so there's a lot of room for improvement.

Looking at the provided examples, the top params have some patterns. For instance, params[0] is often around 4 or 5, and params[1] is negative, like -0.7 or -1.7. The other parameters vary, but some like params[2] and params[6] are negative, while params[3] and params[7] are positive. The bias terms (params[8] and params[9]) are positive as well.

Since the user mentioned that during exploration, a step size of 1.0 should be used, I need to consider perturbing the existing parameters by ±1.0. However, the current highest reward is 293.85, which is still below 500. The user also said that if the current value is below 500, it's a local optimum, so exploration is needed.

Looking at the parameters from the first example with 293.85: params[0] is 4, params[1] is -0.7, params[2] is -5, params[3] is 3.2, etc. Maybe increasing some of the positive parameters or adjusting the negative ones could help. For example, increasing params[0] to 5, or params[3] to 4.2, as seen in another example, but that didn't yield a higher reward. Alternatively, maybe adjusting the bias terms (params[8] and params[9]) to higher values could help.

Wait, but the user said not to propose previously seen params. So I need to generate new ones. Let's think about the parameters. The policy is a linear function, so the weights W and bias B determine the action. The action is the argmax of the linear combination. To balance the pole, the policy needs to respond to the cart's position and velocity, and the pole's angle and angular velocity.

Perhaps the current parameters are not sufficiently sensitive to the pole's angle. For example, if the pole is leaning to the right (positive angle), the cart should move left (action 0). So the weights for the pole angle should be such that when the angle is positive, the action is 0. Maybe the current weights for the pole angle (params[4] and params[5]) are not optimal. In the first example, params[4] is 0.3 and params[5] is -0.3. If we adjust these to be more negative or positive, maybe that would help.

Alternatively, looking at the parameters that have higher rewards. For instance, in the first example, params[0] is 4, which might be contributing to a better response to cart position. Maybe increasing that to 5, but in another example, when params[0] was 5, the reward was lower. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Another approach is to check which parameters are most influential. Since the reward is based on keeping the pole upright and the cart within bounds, the parameters related to the cart's position and velocity, and the pole's angle and angular velocity are critical. Maybe the current parameters are not effectively combining these features.

Since the user wants exploration with step size 1.0, perhaps modifying one parameter at a time. For example, take the first example and change params[0] from 4 to 5, or params[1] from -0.7 to -1.7. But the user said not to propose previously seen params. Wait, the first example had params[0] as 4, params[1] as -0.7, etc. Another example had params[0] as 4, params[1] as -1.7. So maybe trying to vary other parameters that haven't been tried yet.

Looking at the parameters, maybe the bias terms (params[8] and params[9]) are not high enough. In the first example, they are 2.3 and 1.8. If increasing them to 3.3 and 2.8, that might shift the action towards one side more effectively. But I need to make sure that these values haven't been used before.

Alternatively, looking at other parameters. For example, params[2] is -5 in the first example. If changing that to -6, but that was already in another example. Maybe trying to adjust params[3] from 3.2 to 4.2, but that was in another example with lower reward. So maybe that's not the right direction.

Alternatively, looking at params[6] and params[7]. In the first example, params[6] is -6 and params[7] is 5.2. Maybe adjusting those. For instance, increasing params[7] to 6.2, or decreasing params[6] to -7. But the range is [-6.0, 6.0], so -7 is invalid. So maybe changing params[6] to -6.0 (already there) or params[7] to 6.0.

Another thought: the current examples have a lot of variation in params, but the highest reward is still around 293. So maybe the exploration needs to be more aggressive. Let's try changing some parameters that haven't been tried yet. For example, in the first example, params[2] is -5. Maybe changing that to -4 (but that was in another example). Or perhaps changing params[4] from 0.3 to 1.3, or params[5] from -0.3 to -1.3.

Wait, the user said to use a step size of 1.0 during exploration. So if a parameter is currently at 0.3, adding or subtracting 1.0 would take it to 1.3 or -0.7. But in the first example, params[4] is 0.3 and params[5] is -0.3. If I adjust params[4] to 1.3 and params[5] to -1.3, that might be a new set of parameters.

Alternatively, looking at the bias terms. In the first example, params[8] is 2.3 and params[9] is 1.8. If increasing those by 1.0, making them 3.3 and 2.8, respectively. But need to check if that's been done before. Looking at the examples, there's one where params[8] is 2.3 and params[9] is 2.8 (the 15th example). So maybe that's been tried already. So perhaps increasing to 3.3 and 2.8.

Alternatively, changing params[8] to 3.3 and params[9] to 1.8. But need to ensure that this combination hasn't been used. Since the user said not to repeat previous params, I need to be careful.

Another approach: look for parameters that have been changed in other examples and see which ones could be adjusted. For example, in one example, params[2] was -4, params[3] was 3.1, etc. Maybe increasing params[3] to 4.1, but that was in another example with lower reward.

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe the best approach is to take the first example (which had the highest reward so far) and make a small change to one parameter, using the step size of 1.0. For example, take params[0] from 4 to 5, or params[1] from -0.7 to -1.7 (but that was already tried). Alternatively, change params[2] from -5 to -6 (but that was in another example). Hmm.

Wait, the first example's params are: [4, -0.7, -5, 3.2, 0.3, -0.3, -6, 5.2, 2.3, 1.8]. Let's consider changing one parameter by +1.0 or -1.0. For example, changing params[0] from 4 to 5 (already tried in another example with lower reward). Changing params[1] from -0.7 to -1.7 (which was tried and gave 260.40). Changing params[2] fromеньк

params[0]: 5, params[1]: -0.7, params[2]: -5, params[3]: 4.2, params[4]: 1.3, params[5]: -1.3, params[6]: -6, params[7]: 6.2, params[8]: 3.3, params[9]: 2.8
