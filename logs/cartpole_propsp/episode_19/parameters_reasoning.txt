SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

Now you are at iteration 19 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has given me a bunch of training examples for the CartPole environment with a linear policy. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward f(params), which they mention should be around 500. The examples provided all have f(params) of 500.00 except a few which are lower. Now, I need to figure out the next set of parameters to try.

First, I notice that in the examples, the parameters that gave 500.00 have certain patterns. For instance, params[0] is 3.2, params[1] is 4.3, params[2] is 1.3, params[3] is 4.6, params[4] is -2.4, params[5] is 1.9, params[6] is -4.9, params[7] is -0.1, params[8] is 3.3, and params[9] is 4.2. These values are repeated in multiple examples, which suggests that these might be part of a good configuration.

But the user mentioned that if we're below 500, we should explore instead of exploit. However, all the examples here are at 500.00 or lower. Since the current iteration is 19 out of 400, there's still a lot of steps left. The user wants us to explore with a step size of 1.0 during exploration.

Looking at the parameters, maybe I should try varying some of the parameters that are currently at the extremes. For example, params[6] is -4.9 in many examples. If I increase it by 1.0, that would be -3.9. But wait, in one of the examples, params[6] was -3.9 and the reward was still 500.00. So maybe that's not the direction. Alternatively, maybe decreasing it further to -5.9 or -6.0, but in some examples, params[6] was -6.0 and the reward was still 500. So perhaps that's already been tested.

Another parameter to look at is params[8], which is 3.3 in many cases. If I increase that to 4.3 or decrease to 2.3. But in the examples, when params[8] was 4.3, the reward was 500.00, and when it was 2.3, it was also 500.00. So maybe that's not the key.

What about params[7]? It's -0.1 in most examples. If I change that to 0.9 or -1.1, but in the examples, those variations also gave 500.00. So maybe that's not the issue.

Looking at params[4], which is -2.4 in many examples. If I adjust that to -1.4 or -3.4, but in the examples, those gave lower rewards. So maybe keeping it at -2.4 is better.

Hmm. Maybe I should try changing other parameters that haven't been varied much. For example, params[0] is 3.2 in all examples. What if I try increasing it to 4.2 or decreasing to 2.2? But in the examples, when params[0] was 4.2, the reward was 491.10, which is lower. When it was 2.2, the reward was 243.45, which is much lower. So maybe 3.2 is the optimal for params[0].

What about params[1]? It's 4.3 in most examples. If I try changing it to 3.3 or 5.3. In one example, when params[1] was 3.3, the reward was 492.55. So that's slightly lower. Maybe increasing to 5.3? But that's outside the range of the examples. However, the user allows values between -6.0 and 6.0. So perhaps trying 5.3 might be a direction.

Alternatively, looking at params[2], which is 1.3. If I change that to 2.3 or 0.3. In the examples, when it was 2.3, the reward was 500.00, and when it was 0.3, also 500.00. So maybe that's not the key.

What about params[3], which is 4.6. If I increase to 5.6 or decrease to 3.6. In one example, when params[3] was 5.6, the reward was 500.00. So that's possible. Maybe trying that.

Another approach: since the current examples have a lot of parameters fixed, maybe trying to vary some that are less explored. For instance, params[5] is 1.9. What if I change that to 2.9 or 0.9? In one example, when params[5] was 2.9, the reward was 500.00. When it was 0.9, the reward was 500.00 as well. So that's not helpful.

Looking at params[9], which is 4.2 in many examples. When it was 5.2, the reward was lower. So maybe keeping it around 4.2 is better.

Wait, the user says that during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So maybe I should take one of the parameters that's been tested and adjust it by +1.0 or -1.0. For example, take params[6], which was -4.9. If I add 1.0, that's -3.9. But that was already tried and gave 500.00. If I subtract 1.0, that's -5.9, which was also tried. So maybe that's not helpful.

What about params[8]? It was 3.3. If I add 1.0, it's 4.3 (which was tried and gave 500.00). If I subtract 1.0, it's 2.3 (also tried and gave 500.00). So no change.

What about params[7]? It was -0.1. If I add 1.0, it's 0.9 (tried and gave 500.00). Subtract 1.0, it's -1.1 (tried and gave 500.00). So no help.

Hmm. Maybe looking for parameters that haven't been varied much. For example, params[4] is -2.4. If I change that by 1.0 to -1.4 or -3.4. But in the examples, those gave lower rewards. So that's not good.

What about params[2], which is 1.3. If I change it to 2.3 (already tried) or 0.3 (also tried). So that's covered.

Wait, maybe I should look for parameters that are in the middle of the range and try to adjust them. For example, params[0] is 3.2. If I change it to 4.2 (which was tried and gave lower reward) or 2.2 (also lower). So not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe trying to adjust multiple parameters at once. But the user says to explore with step size 1.0. So perhaps changing one parameter by 1.0 each time.

Wait, maybe looking at the parameters that are in the middle of the range. For example, params[8] is 3.3. If I change that to 4.3 or 2.3. Both were tried. So maybe that's not the way.

Alternatively, looking at params[5], which is 1.9. If I change that to 2.9 (tried, 500.00) or 0.9 (tried, 500.00). So no change.

Hmm. Maybe the current examples are all around the same set of parameters, and we need to explore further. Let me think of another approach.

The policy is action = argmax(state @ W + B). So the weights W and bias B are crucial. Maybe adjusting the bias terms (params[8] and params[9]) could help. But in the examples, those are 3.3 and 4.2. If I change them to 4.3 and 5.2, but that was tried and gave lower rewards. Alternatively, maybe changing them to lower values.

Wait, in one example, params[8] was 2.3 and params[9] was 3.2, but that gave lower reward. So maybe keeping them higher is better.

Alternatively, maybe adjusting the W matrix. For example, looking at params[0] and params[1], which are 3.2 and 4.3. If I increase params[0] to 4.2 (which was tried and gave lower reward) or decrease to 2.2 (also lower). So not helpful.

What about params[2] and params[3], which are 1.3 and 4.6. If I increase params[3] to 5.6 (which was tried and gave 500.00) or decrease to 3.6. Maybe trying 3.6?

Alternatively, trying to adjust params[4] and params[5], which are -2.4 and 1.9. If I change params[4] to -1.4 (which gave lower reward) or -3.4 (also lower). Not helpful.

Hmm. Maybe the current set of parameters is already near the optimal, and the next step is to try small variations. But the user says that if we are below 500, we should explore. However, the examples here are all at 500.00. So maybe we need to try to find a way to increase it further.

Wait, the user mentioned that the global optimum should be around 500. So maybe the examples are already at the optimal. But the user says that if you are below that, you should explore. But in this case, the examples are at 500.00. However, the user might be suggesting that there's a way to get higher than 500.00.

Alternatively, maybe the examples are all at 500.00, but there's a possibility to get higher. However, given that the maximum reward per step is 1, and the episode can last up to 200 steps (since the default CartPole has a max of 200 steps), but the user's MAX_STEPS is 400. Wait, but in the problem statement, the user says that the global optimum should be around 500. So maybe the maximum possible is 500. So the examples are already at the maximum.

But the user says that if you are below 500, you should explore. However, in the examples, they are already at 500. So maybe the next step is to try to find a better solution by exploring. But how?

Wait, maybe the examples are not all unique. For example, some of the params are the same but with different values in other parameters. For instance, in the first example, params[8] is 3.3 and params[9] is 4.2. In another example, params[8] is 4.3 and params[9] is 4.2. Both give 500.00. So maybe varying params[8] and params[9] could lead to better results.

But how? Let's think. The action is determined by the maximum of state @ W + B. So the bias terms B are important for the decision. Maybe adjusting them could help.

Alternatively, maybe changing some of the W parameters. For example, params[6] is -4.9. If I change that to -3.9 (which was tried and gave 500.00) or -5.9 (also tried). So no change.

Alternatively, trying to change other parameters that haven't been varied much. For example, params[0] is 3.2. If I change it to 4.2 (tried and gave lower) or 2.2 (tried and gave lower). Not helpful.

Hmm. This is tricky. Maybe the current examples are already at the optimal, and the next step is to try a new set of parameters by varying one of them by 1.0. For example, taking one of the parameters that's in the middle of the range and adjusting it.

Wait, maybe looking at params[7], which is -0.1. If I change that to 1.0 (but the step size is 1.0, so adding 1.0 would make it 0.9, which was tried). Or subtracting 1.0 to -1.1, which was also tried. So no change.

Another parameter: params[5] is 1.9. If I change that to 2.9 (tried, 500.00) or 0.9 (tried, 500.00). So no help.

What about params[2] is 1.3. If I change that to 2.3 (tried) or 0.3 (tried). Both give 500.00.

Hmm. Maybe trying to change multiple parameters at once. For example, increasing params[0] by 1.0 to 4.2, and decreasing params[1] by 1.0 to 3.3. But in one example, params[0] was 4.2 and params[1] was 4.3, giving 491.10. So that's worse. Alternatively, maybe other combinations.

Alternatively, trying to change params[6] to -5.9 (already tried) or -3.9 (also tried). No help.

Wait, maybe looking at the parameters that were in the examples but with different values. For instance, in one example, params[3] was 5.6, which was tried and gave 500.00. So maybe increasing that further to 6.6? But that's outside the allowed range (max is 6.0). So 6.0 is the max. Maybe trying that.

So, params[3] is 4.6 in most examples. If I increase it to 5.6 (already tried), or 6.0. Let's try that. So changing params[3] to 6.0. The rest of the parameters would stay as in the examples.

So the new params would be:

params[0]: 3.2; params[1]: 4.3; params[2]: 1.3; params[3]: 6.0; params[4]: -2.4; params[5]: 1.9; params[6]: -4.9; params[7]: -0.1; params[8]: 3.3; params[9]: 4.2.

This is a new set of parameters, not previously seen. The step size for params[3] is 1.4 (from 4.6 to 6.0), but the user says during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. However, maybe this is a larger step, but since the previous examples had params[3] at 5.6 (which is 1.0 higher than 4.6), maybe this is acceptable.

Alternatively, maybe trying to change another parameter. For example, params[0] is 3.2. If I change it to 4.2 (but that was tried and gave lower reward). Or maybe changing params[1] to 5.3 (adding 1.0). So params[1] becomes 5.3. Let's try that.

So the new params would be:

params[0]: 3.2; params[1]: 5.3; params[2]: 1.3; params[3]: 4.6; params[4]: -2.4; params[5]: 1.9; params[6]: -4.9; params[7]: -0.1; params[8]: 3.3; params[9]: 4.2.

This is a new set, not seen before. The step size for params[1] is +1.0 from 4.3 to 5.3.

Alternatively, changing params[2] to 2.3 (already tried) or 0.3 (also tried). Not helpful.

Hmm. Another idea: since the examples have params[6] as -4.9, maybe trying to change it to -6.0 (already tried) or -3.9 (tried). So no help.

Wait, maybe looking at params[4] which is -2.4. If I change that to -1.4 (which was tried and gave lower reward) or -3.4 (also lower). Not helpful.

Another approach: since the current examples are all giving 500.00, perhaps the maximum is indeed 500.00, and the user's mention of the global optimum being around 500 is correct. Therefore, the next step is to explore further by varying some parameters. But how?

Maybe trying to change a parameter that's not in the examples. For example, params[7] is -0.1. If I change that to 1.0 (but that's a step of +1.1, which is more than 1.0). Alternatively, 0.9 (which was tried). Or -1.1 (also tried). So no help.

Wait, the user said that during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So maybe I should pick one parameter and adjust it by ±1.0. For example, take params[0] (3.2) and adjust it to 4.2 (already tried) or 2.2 (also tried). Not helpful.

What about params[8] (3.3)? Adjust to 4.3 (tried) or 2.3 (tried). Both give 500.00.

Hmm. Maybe I need to change multiple parameters. For example, increase params[3] to 5.6 (already tried) and decrease params[6] to -5.9 (also tried). But that's already been done.

Alternatively, increase params[1] to 5.3 and decrease params[6] to -5.9. Let's try that:

params[0]: 3.2; params[1]: 5.3; params[2]: 1.3; params[3]: 4.6; params[4]: -2.4; params[5]: 1.9; params[6]: -5.9; params[7]: -0.1; params[8]: 3.3; params[9]: 4.2.

This is a new set of parameters. The step size for params[1] is +1.0, and for params[6] is -1.0 from -4.9 to -5.9. This might be a good exploration step.

Alternatively, trying to change params[0] to 4.2 and params[1] to 3.3 (but that was tried and gave lower reward). Not helpful.

Another idea: since the examples have params[8] as 3.3 and params[9] as 4.2, maybe trying to increase both by 1.0. So params[8] becomes 4.3 and params[9] becomes 5.2. But in one example, when params[9] was 5.2, the reward was 345.05, which is lower. So that's not good.

Alternatively, increasing params[8] to 4.3 and keeping params[9] at 4.2. That was tried and gave 500.00. So no change.

Hmm. I think the best approach here is to take one of the parameters that hasn't been varied much and adjust it by ±1.0. For example, changing params[3] from 4.6 to 5.6 (already tried) or 3.6. Let's try 3.6.

So the new params would be:

params[0]: 3.2; params[1]: 4.3; params[2]: 1.3; params[3]: 3.6; params[4]: -2.4; params[5]: 1.9; params[6]: -4.9; params[7]: -0.1; params[8]: 3.3; params[9]: 4.2.

This is a new set of parameters. The step size for params[3] is -1.0 from 4.6 to 3.6. This might be a good exploration step.

Alternatively, trying to change params[5] to 2.9 (already tried) or 0.9 (also tried). Not helpful.

So, I think changing params[3] to 3.6 is a valid exploration step. Let's proceed with that.
</think>

params[0]: 3.2, params[1]: 4.3, params[2]: 1.3, params[3]: 3.6, params[4]: -2.4, params[5]: 1.9, params[6]: -4.9, params[7]: -0.1, params[8]: 3.3, params[9]: 4.2
