SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to find the optimal policy for the cartpole environment using a linear policy. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward f(params), and the current best found so far gives an average reward of around 155-276 over different trials.

First, I need to understand how the policy works. The action space has two parameters (W matrix with 8 elements) and a bias term (B vector with 9 elements). For each state, the action is determined by linearly combining these parameters and applying an argmax. That means for each possible state, we compute the score (action value) using W*state + B, then choose the action corresponding to the highest score.

The reward is +1 every time step where the pole is upright (angle between -0.418 and 0.418 radians) and the cart is within its bounds (-2.4 to 2.4). So the episode ends when either the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

I remember that in reinforcement learning, one approach for linear policies is to use policy gradient methods like Q-learning with neural networks (specifically, actor-critic architectures) or other approximate methods. Since the parameters are fixed, I might be using a different approach here.

Looking at the current params values, they give rewards averaging around 150-276. But the goal is higher. So perhaps adjusting these parameters can lead to better rewards. The current best in the top examples have between 345 and 340 reward points, so maybe increasing W or decreasing some parts of B could help.

Since I can't modify the policy structure beyond adjusting params (I think), I'll try tweaking each parameter step by step. Starting with parameters[0], which is -4.5 in the best cases. If I increase it a bit, say to -3.5, maybe that helps. Also, looking at some trials, increasing W from -6 to around 0 can sometimes improve performance.

I'll try a few different combinations, starting by adjusting parameter[0] first. Let's see how changing each one affects the reward. Maybe after several tries, I can get close to the desired 500 reward level.

I should remember not to repeat parameters I've seen before and explore both positive and negative values for better results. Also, since I'm using a linear policy, maybe adding some non-linear transformations could help, but that might complicate things more than needed.

Finally, after trying several combinations, I'll evaluate each one based on how their reward compares to the others. It's important to see if increasing certain parameters while decreasing others can balance out the score effectively.
