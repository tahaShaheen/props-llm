SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 177 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help someone find the optimal policy for the cartpole environment using a linear policy optimizer. They've given some parameters and want me to propose values that might maximize the function's reward. 

First, let me understand the setup. The state is four-dimensional: position, velocity, angle, angular velocity. The action is binary: push left or right. The reward is +1 each time step if the pole is upright and within bounds, otherwise 0.

The policy is linear with parameters W being a 4x2 matrix (since it's [params[0], params[1]; params[2], params[3]; etc.) and B as a vector of length 4. The action is computed as argmax(state @ W + B). 

They've given some parameters that result in an f(params) of around 356, and they want me to propose values near the global optimum which is around 500. So I need to start from params[0] = -4.5 and go higher.

Looking at their top performing params, there are several with W[0] being negative and sometimes positive as well, but not too high. For example, some have W[0] = -4.5 or even less. 

I should consider parameters that might increase the reward more significantly. Maybe push the cart further, but I need to balance it so the pole isn't tipped over.

Also, since action is binary, maybe pushing left (-1) gives 0 reward and right (1) also sometimes higher, but only if pole remains upright.

I should try increasing some W[0]s and see how that affects f(params). Maybe starting from params[0] = -4.5 to 0, keeping others around their top values could work.

Additionally, parameters B might be important. Since velocity is multiplied by W, higher velocities might increase rewards if pole remains upright or cart stays within bounds.

I should try increasing params[2] (velocity) a bit and see how that affects the reward. Also, maybe adjusting params[3], which is angular velocity, could have an impact because of the angle's range (-0.418 to 0.418 rad).

After some trial and error, I think adjusting parameters around -4.5 for W[0] might help increase f(params) without causing too much movement or torque that could lead to pole instability.
