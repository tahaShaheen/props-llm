SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 177 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has given me a bunch of training examples with their corresponding episodic rewards. The goal is to find the optimal parameters for the linear policy in the CartPole environment. The current iteration is 177 out of 400, so there's still a lot of steps left. The global optimum is supposed to be around 500, so if the current best is 500, maybe we need to explore more to see if there's a higher value.

Looking at the examples provided, the highest reward is 500.00 with the params [6, 2.3, -5, 6, 5.3, 6, -6, 6, 5, 5]. The next ones are slightly lower. The user mentioned that if we're below 500, we should explore instead of exploit. So even though there's a 500, maybe there's a way to get higher.

The exploration step size is 1.0, so I need to consider perturbing the parameters by that amount. Let me check the parameters that are at the extremes. For example, params[0] is 6, which is the upper bound. Maybe increasing some parameters beyond that isn't possible, but maybe adjusting others. However, the parameters are constrained between -6.0 and 6.0 with one decimal place.

Looking at the current top params, some parameters are at 6 or -6. Maybe there's a combination where some parameters are adjusted slightly to get a better reward. For instance, in the first example, params[8] and params[9] are 5 and 5. Maybe increasing them to 6 could help, but in another example, when they were 6, the reward was 497.35, which is lower than 500. So that might not be the case.

Alternatively, maybe changing some of the other parameters. Let's look at params[2], which is -5 in the top example. If we change that to -6, maybe? But in another example, when params[2] was -6, the reward was lower. However, that might depend on other parameters as well.

Another approach is to look for parameters that are not at the extremes. For example, params[1] is 2.3. Maybe adjusting that to 3.3 or 1.3? But in the examples, when params[1] was 1.3, the reward was slightly lower. However, exploration might require trying different values.

Wait, the user mentioned that during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So perhaps taking a step in some parameters. For instance, in the current top params, params[0] is 6. Since that's the maximum, we can't increase it further. Maybe decreasing it by 1.0 to 5.0 and adjusting other parameters accordingly. But that might not be the right approach.

Alternatively, looking at the parameters that are not at the extremes. For example, params[4] is 5.3. Maybe increasing that to 6.3? But that's beyond the allowed range. So no. Or decreasing to 4.3. But again, need to check.

Alternatively, looking at the bias terms (params[8] and params[9]). In the top example, they are 5 and 5. Maybe increasing them to 6. But in another example, when they were 6, the reward was lower. However, maybe if other parameters are adjusted, that could help.

Alternatively, maybe changing params[6] from -6 to -5. But in the top example, params[6] is -6, which might be optimal. Hmm.

This is tricky. Since the user says that if we're below 500, we should explore. But the current best is 500. However, the global optimum is supposed to be around 500. Maybe the current example is already the optimal, but the user might want to confirm that there's no higher value. But given the examples, the highest is 500. However, perhaps there are other parameter combinations that haven't been tried yet.

Alternatively, maybe trying to adjust some parameters that are not at the extremes. For example, in the top example, params[1] is 2.3. If we try 3.3 (adding 1.0) or 1.3 (subtracting 1.0). Let's see. If we take the top params and change params[1] to 3.3, keeping others the same. But since the step size is 1.0, maybe that's a way to explore.

But how to decide which parameter to change? Maybe pick a parameter that's not at the extremes. For example, params[4] is 5.3. If we increase that to 6.3 (but that's over the limit) or decrease to 4.3. Let's say decrease to 4.3. Then, adjust other parameters accordingly.

Alternatively, perhaps changing params[8] and params[9] from 5 to 6. But in the example where they were 6, the reward was lower. However, maybe combining that with other changes.

Alternatively, looking for parameters that are in the middle. For example, params[7] is 6. Maybe changing that to 5.0. But again, not sure.

This is a bit of a shot in the dark. Since the user wants exploration with step size 1.0, perhaps taking a step in one of the parameters that's not at the extremes. Let's pick params[1], which is 2.3. Let's try increasing it by 1.0 to 3.3. So the new params would be:

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 3.3, params[2]: -5, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 5.3, params[5]: 6, params[6]: -6, params[7]: 6, params[8]: 5, params[9]: 5.

But I need to make sure that this hasn't been tried before. Looking at the previous examples, the first one has params[1] as 2.3, others have 1.3 or 2.3. So this is a new combination. That could be a candidate for exploration.

Alternatively, changing params[2] from -5 to -6 (but that was tried in another example and resulted in lower reward). So maybe not.

Alternatively, changing params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3 (but that's over the limit) or 4.3. Let's go with 4.3. Then, the new params would be:

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 2.3, params[2]: -5, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 4.3, params[5]: 6, params[6]: -6, params[7]: 6, params[8]: 5, params[9]: 5.

But again, need to check if that's been tried. In the examples, there's one where params[4] is 4.3, but with other parameters different. So maybe that's a valid exploration.

Another option is to adjust the bias terms. For example, changing params[8] from 5 to 6. So:

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 2.3, params[2]: -5, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 5.3, params[5]: 6, params[6]: -6, params[7]: 6, params[8]: 6, params[9]: 5.

But that's a new combination.

Alternatively, changing params[9] from 5 to 6. So:

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 2.3, params[2]: -5, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 5.3, params[5]: 6, params[6]: -6, params[7]: 6, params[8]: 5, params[9]: 6.

This might be another candidate.

Since the user wants exploration, perhaps trying one of these variations. Let's pick the first one: changing params[1] from 2.3 to 3.3. That's a step of +1.0. Let's go with that.
