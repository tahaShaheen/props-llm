SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.
--- TOP 3 BEST PERFORMING PARAMS ---
params[0]: 6; params[1]: 6; params[2]: -3; params[3]: 6; params[4]: -6; params[5]: 1.8; params[6]: -3.5; params[7]: 4.5; params[8]: -2.5; params[9]: -2.5; f(params): 500.00
params[0]: 6; params[1]: 6; params[2]: -3.5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: -6; params[5]: 1.8; params[6]: -3.5; params[7]: 4.5; params[8]: -2.5; params[9]: -2.5; f(params): 500.00
params[0]: -6; params[1]: -4.5; params[2]: 3; params[3]: 6; params[4]: -6; params[5]: 1.8; params[6]: -3.5; params[7]: 4.5; params[8]: -2.5; params[9]: -2.5; f(params): 500.00
--- MOST RECENT 3 PARAMS ---
params[0]: 6; params[1]: -4.5; params[2]: 3; params[3]: 7; params[4]: -6; params[5]: 1.8; params[6]: -3.5; params[7]: 4.5; params[8]: -2.5; params[9]: -2.5; f(params): 152.00
params[0]: 6; params[1]: 7; params[2]: -3.4; params[3]: 7; params[4]: 1.7; params[5]: 1.7; params[6]: -3.5; params[7]: 4.5; params[8]: -2.6; params[9]: -2.6; f(params): 45.45
params[0]: 6; params[1]: 7; params[2]: -3.5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: -6; params[5]: 1.8; params[6]: -3.5; params[7]: 4.5; params[8]: -2.6; params[9]: -2.6; f(params): 500.00


Now you are at iteration 378 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help this cartpole environment problem. The goal is to find the optimal policy using a linear policy with 18 parameters. From what I understand, each parameter is represented as a decimal between -6 and 6.

The user mentioned that the current params are around -2.5 for each parameter and give a reward of about 152. I need to explore and find higher rewards by adjusting these parameters.

Looking at the provided examples, several sets of params yield a reward close to 500, which is considered the global optimum. These seem to have some positive and negative values spread out within the given range. 

For instance, in one example, params[8] is -2.5 and [9] are also -2.5. In another, they're around 7 or 6 but still result in good rewards. It looks like a balance between pushing the cart right without making it move left too much.

I think the best approach here would be to try these examples since they already seem close to optimal. Maybe trying some of them could give me a better reward than the current ones. I should present several such param sets, starting with those that have some positive and negative values but still maintain good rewards.

Wait, but I shouldn't repeat any parameters from the previous best performers because that might not be helpful for exploration. So maybe I'll pick a few new ones that are different but within the range.

Let me structure this by presenting several param sets near the top performers, each with some variation around the target values. That way, it gives the user a clear idea of what to try without repeating any optimal parameters.
