SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 285 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has given me a bunch of previous parameter sets and their corresponding rewards. The goal is to find the optimal parameters that maximize the episodic reward, which is around 500. The current iteration is 285 out of 400, so there's still room for exploration.

Looking at the examples, the top-performing parameters have values like params[0] at 6, params[1] at 2.3, params[2] at -5, params[3] at 6, and so on. The rewards for these are all around 500, which is the global optimum. However, the user mentioned that if I'm below 500, I should explore instead of exploit. 

Wait, but the examples given already have some parameters achieving 500.00. Maybe those are the local optima, and the user wants to ensure we're not stuck there. But the note says the global optimum should be around 500, so maybe those are already near optimal. However, the user's instruction says that if below 500, explore. But in the examples, some are at 500, others slightly lower. 

Hmm, perhaps the user wants to check if there's a better combination. Since the current iteration is 285, and the maximum is 400, there's still time for exploration. The previous examples have params[8] and params[9] at 5, but in one case, params[9] was 6 and the reward dropped. Maybe tweaking some parameters could lead to higher rewards. 

Looking at the parameters, the ones that are at 500.00 have params[2] as -5, params[3] as 6, params[4] as 5.3, params[5] as 6, params[6] as -6, params[7] as 6, params[8] as 5, params[9] as 5. Maybe changing some of these slightly could help. For example, increasing params[4] from 5.3 to 6, but in one example that was tried, the reward was lower. Alternatively, maybe adjusting params[1] from 2.3 to something else. 

But the user's instruction says during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So if I need to explore, I should make changes of 1.0 in some parameters. However, the current parameters that are at 500.00 already have some high values. Maybe trying to adjust params[2] from -5 to -6, but that might be too drastic. Alternatively, checking if other parameters can be adjusted. 

Wait, the user also said not to propose previously seen params. So I need to make sure that the new parameters haven't been used before. Looking at the previous examples, params[0] is 6 in all, params[1] is 2.3 or 3.3, params[2] is -5 or -4, etc. So maybe trying to change params[1] from 2.3 to 3.3 (but that was tried and got lower reward), or maybe changing params[2] from -5 to -6. 

But the user wants exploration, so perhaps trying to vary some parameters by 1.0. For example, increasing params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3? Wait, but the range is up to 6.0. So maybe 6.0 is the max. Alternatively, decreasing params[4] to 4.3. But in one example, that was tried and the reward was lower. 

Alternatively, looking at params[6], which is -6 in some examples. Maybe changing that to -5. But that might not help. Alternatively, looking at params[7], which is 6. Maybe changing that to 5. 

Alternatively, trying to adjust the bias terms, params[8] and params[9]. In some examples, they are 5 and 5, but in one case, params[9] was 6 and the reward was lower. So maybe keeping them at 5. 

Alternatively, maybe changing params[3] from 6 to 5. But that's a step of -1.0. However, in the examples, when params[3] was 5, the reward was slightly lower. 

Hmm, this is tricky. The user wants exploration, but the current best is already at 500.00. Maybe trying a small change in one parameter. For example, changing params[2] from -5 to -4.5? But the parameters must have one decimal place. So maybe -4.5 is not allowed. Wait, the parameters are in the range [-6.0, 6.0] with one decimal place. So possible values are -6.0, -5.9, ..., 5.9, 6.0. 

So maybe adjusting params[2] from -5.0 to -5.5? But that's a step of -0.5. Wait, the user said during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So maybe changing a parameter by +/-1.0. For example, if params[2] is -5.0, changing it to -6.0 (a step of -1.0). Let's see if that's possible. 

But the previous examples have params[2] as -5.0, and when it was -4.0, the reward was slightly lower. So maybe trying to change params[2] to -6.0. However, that's a big step. Alternatively, maybe changing params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3, but since the max is 6.0, that's not allowed. 

Alternatively, looking at params[1] which is 2.3. If I increase it by 1.0 to 3.3, but that was tried and the reward was lower. So maybe that's not helpful. 

Alternatively, looking at params[3], which is 6.0. If I decrease it by 1.0 to 5.0, but that might lower the reward. 

Hmm, perhaps trying to adjust params[8] or params[9]. For example, changing params[8] from 5.0 to 6.0. But in one example, when params[9] was 6.0, the reward was lower. So maybe that's not helpful. 

Alternatively, trying to change params[6] from -6.0 to -5.0. But that might affect the reward. 

This is challenging. Since the user wants exploration with step size 1.0, but the current best is already at 500.00, maybe trying a new parameter combination that's different from the previous ones. For example, changing params[2] from -5.0 to -6.0, and params[3] from 6.0 to 5.0. But that's a lot of changes. 

Alternatively, changing one parameter by 1.0. Let's pick params[4], which is 5.3. Increasing it by 1.0 would make it 6.3, but that's over the limit. So maybe decreasing it to 4.3. But that was tried before and the reward was lower. 

Alternatively, changing params[5] from 6.0 to 5.0. But that's a step of -1.0. 

Alternatively, looking at params[7], which is 6.0. Decreasing it to 5.0. 

But without knowing the exact impact, it's hard. However, since the user says the global optimum is around 500, and the current examples are already hitting that, maybe the best approach is to slightly perturb one of the parameters that's in the current best set. For example, changing params[2] from -5.0 to -5.5 (but that's a 0.5 step, not 1.0). Wait, the user said during exploration, use step size of 1.0. So maybe changing a parameter by +/-1.0. 

So, for example, if params[2] is -5.0, changing it to -6.0 (step of -1.0). Let's try that. 

So the new params would be:

params[0]: 6.0
params[1]: 2.3
params[2]: -6.0
params[3]: 6.0
params[4]: 5.3
params[5]: 6.0
params[6]: -6.0
params[7]: 6.0
params[8]: 5.0
params[9]: 5.0

This is changing params[2] from -5.0 to -6.0. Let's see if that's a new parameter set not previously seen. Looking at the examples, in the first example, params[2] was -5.0, but not -6.0. So this is a new one. 

Alternatively, changing params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3 (invalid) or 4.3 (already tried). 

Alternatively, changing params[6] from -6.0 to -5.0. That's a step of +1.0. 

But I need to choose one parameter to change. Since the user wants exploration, maybe changing params[2] to -6.0. Let's go with that.
