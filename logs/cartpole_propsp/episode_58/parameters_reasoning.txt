SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

Now you are at iteration 58 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has provided a bunch of training examples where the params are varied, and the episodic reward f(params) is mostly around 500, except for some lower values. The current iteration is 58 out of 400, and the goal is to find the global optimum, which is supposed to be around 500. The user mentioned that if we're below that, we should explore instead of exploit.

Looking at the examples, many of the params have values like 3.2, 4.3, 1.3, etc., and the rewards are 500.00. However, some variations, like changing params[0] to 2.2 or 4.2, resulted in lower rewards. The ones that stayed around 500 had similar values for the first few parameters. The B parameters (params[8] and [9]) are around 3.3 and 4.2, which might be important.

Since the current examples are mostly around 500, but the global optimum is supposed to be around 500, maybe there's a need to explore more. The user said to use a search step size of 1.0 during exploration. So perhaps I should perturb some of the parameters by +/-1.0 from the current values. 

Looking at the existing params, maybe trying to adjust some of the parameters that are in the middle range. For example, params[6] is -4.9 in many examples. If I change that to -5.9 or -3.9, but those were already tried. Maybe other parameters? Let's see. The params that are varied in the examples include params[0], [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. 

Since the user wants exploration, I should pick a parameter that hasn't been varied much and adjust it. For example, params[7] is mostly -0.1. Maybe changing that to 0.9 or -1.1. But those were tried. Alternatively, maybe params[5] is 1.9. If I increase it to 2.9 or decrease to 0.9. Wait, in one of the examples, params[5] was 2.9 and the reward was 500.00. So that's already tried. 

Alternatively, maybe params[4] is -2.4. In one example, it was changed to -1.4 and the reward dropped. But maybe trying -3.4? Wait, that was also tried and gave 500.00. Hmm. 

Another approach: since the current examples are all around 500, maybe trying to change multiple parameters slightly. For example, increasing params[1] from 4.3 to 5.3 (but that was tried and gave lower reward). Or decreasing it to 3.3. But that might be too much. 

Wait, the user said to use a step size of 1.0 during exploration. So if the current params are around 3.2 for params[0], maybe trying 3.2 +1.0=4.2 or 3.2-1.0=2.2. But those were already tried. For example, params[0] was 4.2 and got 484.95, which is lower. So maybe that's not helpful. 

Looking at params[8] and [9], which are 3.3 and 4.2. Maybe adjusting those. For example, increasing params[8] to 4.3 or decreasing to 2.3. In one example, params[8] was 4.3 and got 500.00. So that's already tried. 

Hmm. Maybe the parameters that are not changed much in the examples. For instance, params[7] is -0.1. Maybe changing it to 1.0 or -1.0. Wait, in some examples, it was -1.1 and 0.9. But those were tried. 

Alternatively, maybe changing params[2] from 1.3 to 0.3 or 2.3. Those were tried and gave 500.00. So that's not helpful. 

Wait, maybe the best approach is to look for parameters that have not been varied much. For example, params[7] is always -0.1 except in some examples. Maybe trying to change that to other values. But that was already done. 

Alternatively, maybe looking at the parameters that are in the middle of the range. For example, params[6] is -4.9. Maybe changing that to -3.9 or -5.9. But those were tried. 

Alternatively, maybe trying to change params[3] from 4.6 to 5.6 or 3.6. Those were tried and gave 500.00. 

Hmm. It seems like all possible variations with step size 1.0 have been tried, but the reward is still 500. Maybe the current examples are already in a flat region. However, the user said the global optimum is around 500, so maybe we need to continue exploring. 

Wait, perhaps the user is expecting me to try a new combination. For example, changing multiple parameters at once. Let's pick some parameters and adjust them. For example, take the base params from the first example: [3.2, 4.3, 1.3, 4.6, -2.4, 1.9, -4.9, -0.1, 3.3, 4.2]. Let's change params[6] from -4.9 to -5.9 (but that was tried). Or maybe change params[4] from -2.4 to -3.4 (tried). 

Alternatively, maybe change params[5] from 1.9 to 2.9 (tried). 

Wait, perhaps trying to change params[8] from 3.3 to 4.3 (already tried) or 2.3 (tried). 

Alternatively, maybe changing params[9] from 4.2 to 5.2 or 3.2. But in one example, params[9] was 3.2 and got 500.00. 

Hmm. Maybe there's no more parameters to vary. But the user said to explore. Maybe I should pick a parameter that hasn't been varied much. For example, params[7] is -0.1. Maybe trying to change it to 1.0. But that's a step of 1.1, which is more than 1.0. Wait, the step size is 1.0. So from -0.1, adding 1.0 gives 0.9, which was tried. Subtracting 1.0 gives -1.1, which was also tried. 

Alternatively, maybe changing params[8] from 3.3 to 4.3 (already tried). 

This is tricky. Maybe the best approach is to pick a parameter that hasn't been varied much and adjust it. But in the examples, all parameters have been varied. Alternatively, maybe trying to change two parameters at once. For example, increasing params[0] and params[1] by 1.0 each. But that would be 4.2 and 5.3. But that was tried and gave lower reward. 

Alternatively, maybe trying to change params[6] and params[7] together. For example, params[6] to -5.9 and params[7] to -1.1. But that might not be helpful. 

Alternatively, maybe trying to change params[4] from -2.4 to -1.4 (which was tried and gave lower reward). 

Hmm. Since all possible variations with step size 1.0 have been tried, and the reward is still 500, maybe the current region is already optimal. But the user said the global optimum is around 500, so perhaps we need to continue exploring. Maybe trying a new combination that hasn't been tried yet. For example, changing params[2] to 2.3 and params[5] to 2.9. Wait, that was tried in one example and gave 500.00. 

Alternatively, changing params[7] to 1.0. But that's a step of 1.1, which is more than 1.0. 

Wait, the user said to use a search step size of 1.0 during exploration. So each parameter change should be by ±1.0. But maybe trying to change multiple parameters. For example, changing params[0] from 3.2 to 4.2 (already tried), and params[1] from 4.3 to 5.3 (already tried). 

Alternatively, maybe changing params[6] from -4.9 to -3.9 (already tried). 

At this point, I think all possible variations with step size 1.0 have been tried, and the reward remains around 500. So maybe the current examples are already in the optimal region. However, the user mentioned that the global optimum is around 500, so perhaps the answer is to continue exploring. But since the user wants to avoid previously seen params, I need to find a new combination. 

Wait, looking back at the examples, there's one where params[0] was 3.2, params[1] 4.3, params[2] 1.3, params[3] 4.6, params[4] -2.4, params[5] 1.9, params[6] -4.9, params[7] -0.1, params[8] 3.3, params[9] 4.2. All of these have been tried. So maybe changing params[7] to 0.9 (already tried), or to -1.1 (already tried). 

Alternatively, maybe changing params[8] to 4.3 (already tried), or params[9] to 5.2. But that's a step of 1.0 from 4.2. So 4.2 +1.0=5.2. Let's try that. So params[9] becomes 5.2. The rest remain the same. That's a new combination. So the new params would be:

params[0]: 3.2; params[1]: 4.3; params[2]: 1.3; params[3]: 4.6; params[4]: -2.4; params[5]: 1.9; params[6]: -4.9; params[7]: -0.1; params[8]: 3.3; params[9]: 5.2.

This hasn't been tried before, so it's a new exploration step. The user might accept this as a new parameter set to explore.
