SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 58 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.

WARNING: This is attempt 2 out of 10. You have FAILED 1 times already. You have 8 attempts remaining. MAKE SURE THE FORMAT IS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT: 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, ...' with all values in range [-6.0, 6.0]. If you fail again, the entire episode will be discarded.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has given me a bunch of training examples with different parameter values and their corresponding episodic rewards. My task is to find the optimal parameters that maximize the reward. The current iteration is 58 out of 400, and I have to make sure I don't repeat any previous parameters.

Looking at the examples, the highest reward so far is around 428.05. But the user mentioned that the global optimum should be around 500, so I need to explore more. The previous attempts have mostly kept params[0], [1], [3], [4], [7], [8], [9] at high values like 6 or 5.3. Maybe there's a combination where some parameters are lower or even negative that could lead to a higher reward.

The exploration step size is 1.0, so I should consider changing some parameters by +/-1.0 from their current values. For example, in the first example, params[2] is -3. Maybe increasing that to -2 or -4 could help. Also, params[6] is -6 in some examples, but maybe changing that to -5 or -7 (though -7 is out of range). Wait, the parameters must be within [-6.0, 6.0], so -6 is the minimum.

Looking at the policy structure, the action is determined by the state multiplied by W plus B. To balance the pole, the policy needs to adjust the cart's movement based on the state variables. The weights for the pole angle (params[4] and [5]) and angular velocity (params[6] and [7]) might be crucial. Maybe adjusting these parameters could lead to better balance.

In the top examples, params[4] is often 5.3 or 6.0. Maybe increasing that further, but since the max is 6.0, that's already at the upper limit. What about params[2] and [3], which are -3 and 6? Maybe changing params[2] to -4 or -2. Also, the bias terms (params[8] and [9]) are often 6.0. Maybe reducing them slightly could help.

Another thought: some of the examples have params[6] as -6.0. Since the pole's angular velocity is part of the state, having a negative weight here might mean that when the pole is rotating in one direction, the action is adjusted. But if the angular velocity is too high, maybe the weights need to be more negative to counteract that. However, since the maximum is -6.0, that's already the limit.

I should also check if any parameters are being underexplored. For instance, params[1] is mostly around 0.3 to 2.3. Maybe trying a higher value, like 3.3, could lead to better results. However, I need to ensure that I'm not repeating previous parameters. Let me check the examples again to see which parameters have been tried.

Looking at the first example, params[0] is 6.0, [1] is 1.3, [2] is -3, [3] is 6, [4] is 5.3, [5] is 2.7, [6] is -6, [7] is 6, [8] is 6, [9] is 6. The next example changes [5] to 3.7. Then another example changes [8] and [9] to 5. So maybe varying those could help.

Since the user says to explore both positive and negative values with a step size of 1.0, I should consider modifying some parameters by +/-1.0. For example, take the first example and change params[2] from -3 to -4 (since that's a step of -1.0). Also, maybe lower params[8] and [9] from 6 to 5. But I need to ensure that the new parameters haven't been tried before.

Wait, in the examples, there's one where params[8] and [9] are 5. So changing them to 5 is already tried. Maybe trying 4.0? But the step size is 1.0. Alternatively, changing params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3, but that's beyond 6.0. So no.

Another approach: look for parameters that are at the extremes (like 6.0) and see if reducing them slightly might help. For example, params[0] is 6.0 in many examples. Maybe reducing it to 5.0. Similarly, params[3] is 6.0; reducing to 5.0. But I need to check if that's been tried.

Looking at the examples, there's one where params[0] is 5.0, [3] is 5.0, etc. So maybe that's already tried. Alternatively, changing params[7] from 6.0 to 5.0. But again, need to check.

Alternatively, look for parameters that are in the middle and adjust them. For example, params[5] is 2.7 in some examples. Maybe increasing it to 3.7 (step of +1.0). That was tried in the second example, but maybe with other parameters.

Hmm. Since the user says to explore instead of exploit if below 500, I need to generate new parameters that haven't been tried. Let's think of a new set. For instance, take the first example and change params[2] from -3 to -4 (step -1.0), params[6] from -6 to -5 (step +1.0), and params[8] and [9] from 6 to 5 (step -1.0). That would be a new combination. But I need to make sure that this hasn't been tried before.

Looking at the examples, there's one where params[2] is -4, params[6] is -6, and params[8] and [9] are 6. So changing params[6] to -5 and params[8]/[9] to 5. That might be a new combination. Let me check the examples again. The example with params[2] as -4 is the fifth one, but in that case, params[6] is -6 and params[8]/[9] are 6. So changing params[6] to -5 and params[8]/[9] to 5 would be a new set.

Another possibility: take the first example and change params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3 (but that's over 6.0). Not allowed. So maybe 6.0. But that's already in some examples.

Alternatively, change params[1] from 1.3 to 2.3 (step +1.0). That was tried in the 12th example. So that's already there.

Hmm. Maybe try changing params[6] from -6 to -5, and params[7] from 6 to 5. Let's see. So params[6] is -5, params[7] is 5. That's a new combination. Let me check if that's in the examples. The examples have params[6] as -6, -5, -5, etc. But in the 14th example, params[6] is -6 and params[7] is 5. So changing params[6] to -5 and params[7] to 5 would be new?

Wait, the 14th example has params[6] as -6, params[7] as 5. So changing params[6] to -5 and keeping params[7] as 5. That might be a new set. Let me check the existing examples. The 14th example is params[6]: -6, params[7]: 5. So if I change params[6] to -5 and leave params[7] as 5, that's a new combination.

Alternatively, take the first example and change params[6] to -5, and params[8] and [9] to 5. That would be a new set. Let's try that. So:

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 1.3, params[2]: -3, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 5.3, params[5]: 2.7, params[6]: -5, params[7]: 6, params[8]: 5, params[9]: 5.

Wait, but in the 7th example, there's params[6]: -5, params[7]:6, params[8]:5, [9]:5. So that's already tried. So that's not allowed. Need to avoid that.

Another idea: change params[3] from 6 to 5. So in the first example, params[3] is 6. Changing that to 5. Then, maybe also change params[7] from 6 to 5. So:

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 1.3, params[2]: -3, params[3]:5, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:2.7, params[6]:-6, params[7]:5, params[8]:6, params[9]:6.

Is this combination in the examples? Let me check. The 7th example has params[3]:6, params[7]:6. So changing params[3] to 5 and params[7] to 5. That might be a new combination. Let's see. The 7th example is params[3]:6, [7]:6. So yes, changing those to 5 would be new.

But how about the reward? Maybe this combination could lead to better results. Alternatively, change params[2] to -4 and params[6] to -5. Let's try that.

params[0]:6, params[1]:1.3, params[2]:-4, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:2.7, params[6]:-5, params[7]:6, params[8]:6, params[9]:6.

Is this in the examples? The fifth example has params[2]:-4, params[6]:-6, params[8]/[9]:6. So changing params[6] to -5 is a new combination. That's possible.

I think that's a viable approach. So the new parameters would be:

params[0]:6, params[1]:1.3, params[2]:-4, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:2.7, params[6]:-5, params[7]:6, params[8]:6, params[9]:6.

This hasn't been tried before, as per the examples given. Let me check again. The fifth example has params[2] as -4, params[6] as -6, and params[8]/[9] as 6. So changing params[6] to -5 is new. So this combination is new. That should be acceptable.
