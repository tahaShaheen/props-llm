SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to optimize the parameters for a linear policy in the CartPole environment. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward, which they mentioned should be around 500. From the provided examples, the highest reward so far is 492.00. The user wants to explore more to reach the global optimum.

Looking at the current top params, most of them have params[0], [1], [3], [5], [7], [8], [9] set to 6 or 5, while some are lower. The params that are giving higher rewards seem to have a mix of positive and negative values, especially in positions 2, 4, 6. For example, params[2] and params[6] are often -6 or -5. 

The user mentioned that during exploration, a step size of 1.0 should be used. So maybe I should look for parameters that are different from the current ones. Let's see, in the current top params, params[2] is -6 or -5. Maybe trying a less negative value here could help. Also, params[4] and [5] are around 4.3 to 6. Maybe increasing them further? But since the maximum is 6.0, perhaps there's a balance here.

Wait, but the user said to explore both positive and negative values. So maybe adjusting some parameters that are currently at their maximum or minimum. For example, in the first example, params[0] is 6.0, which is the maximum. Maybe reducing that slightly and increasing others. Alternatively, looking at the params that have lower rewards, perhaps they have different combinations.

Another approach: looking at the structure of the policy. The action is determined by the state multiplied by W plus B. So each weight in W and the bias in B affects how the state variables influence the action. For CartPole, the cart position and pole angle are critical. Maybe the weights for cart position (params[0] and [1]) and pole angle (params[4] and [5]) are important. 

In the current top params, params[0] and [1] are 6 and 1.3. Maybe increasing params[1] could help? But it's already at 1.3. Alternatively, looking for parameters that have not been tried yet. For example, in the examples, params[2] is mostly -6 or -5. What if we try a higher value here, like -4? But the user wants exploration with step size 1.0. So if the current value is -6, adding 1.0 would make it -5, but that's already in the examples. Maybe trying a different parameter.

Wait, the user said not to propose previously seen params. So I need to find new combinations. Let's check the existing params. For example, in the first entry, params[0] is 6, params[1] is 1.3, params[2] is -6, params[3] is 6, params[4] is 4.3, params[5] is 4.7, params[6] is -6, params[7] is 6, params[8] is 6, params[9] is 6. So maybe varying some of these. For instance, increasing params[4] from 4.3 to 5.3 (as in another example) gave a lower reward. So maybe that's not the way. 

Alternatively, looking at the bias terms. The B terms are params[8] and [9]. In the top examples, they are often 6 or 5. Maybe reducing them? But that might not be helpful. 

Alternatively, looking for parameters that have not been explored. For example, in the current examples, params[2] is -6 or -5. What about trying -4? But the step size is 1.0, so if we start from -6, adding 1.0 would be -5, which is already in the examples. So maybe trying -7? But the range is [-6.0, 6.0]. So can't go below -6.0. 

Hmm, perhaps adjusting other parameters. For example, params[3] is 6 in some examples, but maybe trying 5.0? Or params[5] is 5.7, maybe 6.0. Wait, in some examples, params[5] is 6.0. But those have lower rewards. 

Alternatively, looking at the current highest reward of 492.00, which has params[4] as 4.3 and params[5] as 4.7. Maybe increasing those to 5.3 and 5.7? But that was tried in another example (params[4]:5.3, params[5]:5.7) which gave 491.70, slightly lower. 

Wait, but the user said the global optimum is around 500, so maybe there's a better combination. Perhaps adjusting the bias terms. For example, in the highest reward example, B is [6,6]. What if we lower B to [5,5] and adjust other parameters? Not sure. 

Alternatively, looking for parameters that are not in the current top. For example, in the examples, some have params[1] as 0.3 or 2.3. Maybe trying 1.3 is a good value. 

Another thought: the current top params have params[2] and [6] as -6, which might be important for balancing. Maybe keeping those negative values but adjusting others. 

Since the user wants exploration, perhaps trying to change one parameter by 1.0 from the current top. For example, in the first top param, params[0] is 6.0. Let's decrease it by 1.0 to 5.0, and see. But need to ensure that this combination hasn't been tried before. Looking at the examples, there's one with params[0] as 5.0, but others vary. 

Alternatively, changing params[4] from 4.3 to 5.3 (as in another example) but that gave lower reward. Maybe that's not the way. 

Wait, the user mentioned that during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So maybe take the current best params and perturb each parameter by +/-1.0. Let's take the first example with reward 492.00: params are [6,1.3,-6,6,4.3,4.7,-6,6,6,6]. Let's try changing params[4] from 4.3 to 5.3 (adding 1.0). But that was tried in another example (params[4]:5.3, params[5]:5.7) with lower reward. So that might not be good. 

Alternatively, change params[2] from -6 to -5 (already in some examples). Maybe change params[3] from 6 to 5.0. Let's try that. So new params would be: params[0]:6, params[1]:1.3, params[2]:-6, params[3]:5, params[4]:4.3, params[5]:4.7, params[6]:-6, params[7]:5, params[8]:6, params[9]:6. But I need to check if this combination is already in the examples. Looking through the provided examples, there's one where params[3] is 5 and params[7] is 5, but others differ. So maybe this is a new combination. 

Alternatively, changing params[8] and [9] from 6 to 5. Maybe that's a way to explore. But I need to make sure it's not already tried. 

Another approach: looking for parameters that are not in the current top. For example, in the examples, some have params[2] as -5, but maybe trying -6.0 again. But that's already in the examples. 

Hmm, this is tricky. Since the user wants exploration, perhaps trying to vary multiple parameters. For example, take the current best and change params[2] from -6 to -5, params[3] from 6 to 5, and params[6] from -6 to -5. That would be a new combination. Let me check if that's in the examples. Looking through, there's an example where params[2] is -5, params[3] is 5, params[6] is -5, params[7] is 5, but others differ. So this could be a new set. 

Alternatively, trying to set some parameters to 0.0. For example, setting params[1] to 0.3 (as in one example) but that gave lower rewards. 

Wait, the user said not to propose previously seen params. So I need to ensure that the new combination hasn't been tried. Let me check the examples again. For instance, the first example has params[0] 6, params[1] 1.3, params[2] -6, params[3] 6, params[4] 4.3, params[5] 4.7, params[6] -6, params[7] 6, params[8] 6, params[9] 6. If I change params[3] from 6 to 5, and params[7] from 6 to 5, and keep others the same, that would be a new combination. Let's see: params[0] 6, params[1] 1.3, params[2] -6, params[3] 5, params[4] 4.3, params[5] 4.7, params[6] -6, params[7] 5, params[8] 6, params[9] 6. I don't see this exact combination in the provided examples. So that could be a candidate. 

Alternatively, changing params[8] and [9] from 6 to 5. But need to check if that's in examples. There's an example where params[8] and [9] are 5. So maybe that's already tried. 

Another idea: look for parameters that are in the middle range. For example, params[1] is 1.3. Maybe increasing it to 2.3 (as in one example) but that example had lower rewards. 

Alternatively, trying to set some parameters to 0.0. But that might not be helpful. 

Hmm. Maybe the best approach is to take the current best and perturb one parameter by 1.0. For example, take the first example and change params[4] from 4.3 to 5.3. But that was tried and gave lower reward. So maybe not. 

Alternatively, change params[2] from -6 to -5, which is already in some examples. But maybe changing another parameter. For example, change params[5] from 4.7 to 5.7 (adding 1.0). That was tried in another example (params[4]:4.3, params[5]:5.7) which gave 491.70. 

Alternatively, change params[5] to 5.7 and params[4] to 5.3, but that's already tried. 

This is challenging. Maybe the best way is to make a small change to one parameter that hasn't been explored much. For example, in the current best, params[3] is 6.0. Let's reduce it to 5.0 and see. That's a new combination if other parameters are kept the same. 

So the proposed parameters would be:

params[0]:6.0, params[1]:1.3, params[2]:-6.0, params[3]:5.0, params[4]:4.3, params[5]:4.7, params[6]:-6.0, params[7]:6.0, params[8]:6.0, params[9]:6.0. 

But I need to check if this is in the examples. Looking through the provided examples, there's one where params[3] is 5.0 and params[7] is 6.0, but others may differ. For example, in the entry with reward 398.95, params[3] is 6, params[7] is 6. So this new combination might not be in the examples. 

Alternatively, changing params[7] from 6 to 5.0. That would be another variation. 

I think this is a viable approach. Let's go with that.
