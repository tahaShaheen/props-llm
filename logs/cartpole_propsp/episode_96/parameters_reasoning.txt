SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has given me a bunch of training examples for the CartPole environment with different parameter values and their corresponding episodic rewards. My task is to find the global optimal policy, which they mentioned should be around 500. The current highest reward from the examples is 492.00, so there's room for improvement.

First, I need to analyze the existing parameters. Looking at the top examples, several have params[0] and params[1] set to 6 and 1.3 respectively, and some of the other parameters like params[2], params[3], etc., are set to -6 or 6. The B values (params[8] and params[9]) are often 6. However, the rewards are decreasing as some parameters are adjusted, which suggests that maybe there's a balance needed here.

The user mentioned that if I'm below the global optimum, I should explore instead of exploit. Since the current best is 492, which is below 500, I need to explore more. The exploration step size is 1.0, so I should consider varying the parameters by +/-1.0 from the current values.

Looking at the parameters in the top examples, maybe there's a pattern. For instance, in the first example, params[0] is 6, params[1] is 1.3, and the others are a mix of -6 and 6. But when some parameters were adjusted, like params[2] from -6 to -5, the reward dropped. However, in some cases, changing params[4] and params[5] to higher values increased the reward.

Wait, but the global optimum is supposed to be around 500. So maybe the current parameters are not fully exploring the space. Let me think about the policy structure. The policy is a linear function, so the weights W and bias B are crucial. The action is determined by the maximum of the two linear combinations (state @ W + B). To maximize the reward, the policy needs to balance the cart effectively.

Perhaps the existing examples have some parameters that are too extreme. For example, params[2] is -6, which might be too negative. Maybe adjusting some of these parameters to less extreme values could help. Alternatively, maybe some parameters need to be increased or decreased further.

Since the exploration step is 1.0, I can take the current best parameters and perturb them. Let's take the first example with reward 492.00. The params are:

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 1.3, params[2]: -6, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 4.3, params[5]: 4.7, params[6]: -6, params[7]: 6, params[8]: 6, params[9]: 6.

If I want to explore, I can try changing some of these parameters by +/-1.0. For example, maybe increasing params[4] from 4.3 to 5.3 (as seen in another example) helped, but that example had a lower reward. Hmm, that example had 491.70, which is slightly lower. So maybe that's not the way.

Alternatively, looking at the parameters that were changed in other examples. For instance, in one example, params[2] was changed from -6 to -5, but that led to a lower reward. So perhaps keeping params[2] at -6 is better. However, maybe other parameters need adjustment.

Another approach is to look for parameters that haven't been explored much. For example, in the given examples, many have params[0] at 6, but maybe trying lower values could help. However, since the user said to search both positive and negative values, perhaps trying some negative values for params[0] might be beneficial.

Wait, but the current best is with params[0] at 6. Maybe that's a good value. However, other parameters like params[4] and params[5] are around 4.3-6. Maybe increasing them further could help. But the maximum allowed is 6.0, so if they are already at 6, there's no room to increase.

Looking at the parameters in the first example, params[4] is 4.3 and params[5] is 4.7. In another example, they were increased to 5.3 and 5.7, which gave a slightly lower reward. That's confusing. Maybe there's a non-linear relationship here, and the optimal values are in between.

Alternatively, perhaps the bias terms (params[8] and params[9]) are too high. In the first example, they are both 6. Maybe lowering them could help. But in other examples, when they were lowered to 5, the reward decreased. Hmm.

This is tricky. Since the user says to explore with step size 1.0, maybe I should take the current best parameters and perturb each parameter by +/-1.0. For example, take the first example and try changing params[0] to 5 or 7 (but 7 is beyond the allowed range of -6 to 6, so 5 is the only option). Similarly for other parameters.

But the user also said not to propose previously seen params. So I need to ensure that the new parameters haven't been tried before. Looking at the examples, many have params[0] at 6, params[1] at 1.3, etc. So perhaps changing some parameters that haven't been explored much.

For example, in the first example, params[4] is 4.3. If I increase that to 5.3 (as in another example), but that example had lower reward. Alternatively, maybe decreasing some parameters.

Alternatively, maybe trying different values for params[2] and params[6], which are set to -6. What if I set them to -5? But that was tried in another example and led to lower reward. So maybe that's not the way.

Alternatively, looking at the B terms. In the first example, they are 6. Maybe trying lower values for B. But in another example, when they were set to 5, the reward dropped. So perhaps keeping them at 6 is better.

Another thought: the policy is using argmax on the two linear combinations. So the weights W and B need to create two linear functions that effectively decide the action. Maybe some of the W parameters need to be adjusted to better capture the state's influence.

But without knowing the exact dynamics, it's hard to tell. Given the constraints, the best approach is to explore by perturbing the current best parameters by +/-1.0 in each parameter, ensuring not to repeat previous ones.

So, taking the first example's parameters and trying to change one parameter by +/-1.0. For example, changing params[4] from 4.3 to 5.3 (already tried), but that didn't help. Alternatively, changing params[2] from -6 to -5 (also tried). Maybe changing params[3] from 6 to 5 or 7 (but 7 is out of range). So 5. Let's try that.

So, new params could be:

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 1.3, params[2]: -6, params[3]: 5, params[4]: 4.3, params[5]: 4.7, params[6]: -6, params[7]: 6, params[8]: 6, params[9]: 6.

Wait, this was tried in one of the examples (the fifth one) with reward 480.50, which is lower. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe changing params[7] from 6 to 5. Let's try that. So:

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 1.3, params[2]: -6, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 4.3, params[5]: 4.7, params[6]: -6, params[7]: 5, params[8]: 6, params[9]: 6.

But I don't know if this has been tried before. Looking through the examples, I don't see that exact combination. Let's check the examples again.

Looking at the examples, in the fifth one, params[7] was 6. In another example, params[7] was 5. So maybe that's a possibility. But I need to ensure that this combination hasn't been tried before.

Alternatively, maybe changing params[8] or params[9] from 6 to 5. Let's try that. For example:

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 1.3, params[2]: -6, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 4.3, params[5]: 4.7, params[6]: -6, params[7]: 6, params[8]: 5, params[9]: 6.

This was tried in one of the examples (the ninth one) with reward 464.45, which is lower. So that's not helpful.

Hmm. This is challenging. Maybe the best approach is to take the current best parameters and perturb one parameter that hasn't been changed much. For example, in the firstดวง, params[4] is 4.3, but in other examples, it's been increased to 5.3. However, that didn't help. Maybe trying to increase params[5] from 4.7 to 5.7?

Let me check if that combination has been tried. In one example, params[4] is 5.3 and params[5] is 5.7, but that example had a reward of 491.70. So that's lower than the first example. So perhaps that's not the way.

Alternatively, maybe changing params[1] from 1.3 to 2.3? That hasn't been tried in the examples. Let's consider that. So:

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 2.3, params[2]: -6, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 4.3, params[5]: 4.7, params[6]: -6, params[7]: 6, params[8]: 6, params[9]: 6.

This is a new combination. Since the user says to explore, this might be a good candidate. The idea is that params[1] could be a key parameter that's been underexplored. However, I need to make sure that this hasn't been tried before. Looking at the examples, none of them have params[1] at 2.3. So this is a new parameter set.

Alternatively, maybe changing params[0] from 6 to 5. But that was tried in some examples and led to lower rewards. For example, in the second example, params[0] was 6, but in others, it was 5.3, which might not be helpful.

Another possibility is to change params[2] from -6 to -7, but that's beyond the allowed range of -6 to 6. So not allowed. Similarly, other parameters can't go beyond that.

Alternatively, changing params[6] from -6 to -5. But that was tried in some examples and led to lower rewards.

Hmm. Maybe I should consider changing multiple parameters at once, but the user's instruction is to explore with step size 1.0. So perhaps changing one parameter by +/-1.0.

Since the current best is 492.00, and the user wants to explore, maybe trying to change params[4] from 4.3 to 5.3 (already tried, but maybe with different other parameters). However, in the example where that was done, the reward was lower. So maybe that's not the way.

Alternatively, changing params[5] from 4.7 to 5.7. Let's see. If I do that, the parameters would be:

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 1.3, params[2]: -6, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 4.3, params[5]: 5.7, params[6]: -6, params[7]: 6, params[8]: 6, params[9]: 6.

This hasn't been tried before. Let's check the examples. In one example, params[5] was 5.7, but with params[4] at 5.3. That example had a reward of 491.70. So maybe this new combination could be better. It's worth trying.

Alternatively, changing params[4] and params[5] both. But that's more than one step. The user said to explore with step size 1.0, so maybe changing one parameter at a time.

Another thought: in the current best example, params[4] is 4.3 and params[5] is 4.7. Maybe increasing both to 5.3 and 5.7, but that would be two steps. However, since the user wants exploration, maybe that's acceptable. But I need to ensure that this hasn't been tried before.

Looking at the examples, in one case, params[4] was 5.3 and params[5] 5.7, but that had a lower reward. So maybe that's not the way.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the bias terms are too high. Let's try lowering params[8] and params[9] to 5. But in another example, that led to lower rewards. So that might not help.

This is really challenging. Given that the user says to explore, perhaps the best approach is to take the current best parameters and perturb one parameter by +/-1.0, even if it's a parameter that was previously changed. For example, changing params[4] from 4.3 to 5.3 (already tried) but maybe with other parameters adjusted. However, I need to make sure that the new parameters haven't been tried before.

Alternatively, trying a completely new set of parameters. For example, setting params[0] to 5 instead of 6, and adjusting other parameters accordingly. But this might be too risky.

Alternatively, looking at other examples where the reward was higher. Wait, the first example is the highest with 492.00. The next is 491.70, which is slightly lower. So the first example is the best so far.

Given that, I think the best exploration step is to change one parameter that hasn't been adjusted much. For example, changing params[1] from 1.3 to 2.3, as I thought earlier. That's a new parameter set and might lead to higher rewards.

So, I'll propose that as the next step.
