SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 134 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to optimize the parameters for a linear policy in the CartPole environment. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward, which they mentioned should be around 500. The current examples provided have values around 497, which is close but not quite there. 

Looking at the top examples, the first one has params[0] to [9] with several 6s and some other values. The highest reward there is 497.35. The user's note says that if they're below 500, they should explore instead of exploit. So maybe the current parameters are in a local optimum and need some exploration.

The user's instruction says during exploration, use a search step size of 1.0. That means changing the parameters by ±1.0 from the current values. But I need to make sure not to repeat any previously seen params. Let me check the existing examples to avoid duplication.

Looking at the existing params, many of them have values like 6, 5.3, 5.7, etc. For example, params[0] is often 5 or 6, params[2] and [6] are often -6 or -5. Maybe trying to adjust some of these parameters by 1.0 step. For instance, if params[0] is 6, maybe trying 5 or 7 (but 7 is out of range, so 5). Similarly, if params[2] is -6, maybe trying -5. But need to check if those are already in the examples.

Wait, the user mentioned that the params are in the range [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place. So adjusting by 1.0 step would mean adding or subtracting 1.0. For example, if a param is 6, subtracting 1.0 would make it 5.0. If it's -6, adding 1.0 would make it -5.0.

Looking at the current top params, the first one has params[0] as 6, params[2] as -6, params[4] as 5.3, etc. Maybe trying to tweak some of these. For example, changing params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3 (but that's over 6.0, so not allowed). Alternatively, changing it to 4.3. But that's already in some examples.

Alternatively, maybe changing params[8] or [9], which are currently 6 in the top example. If I lower them to 5, but that's already tried. Hmm.

Wait, the user's note says to explore both positive and negative values. Maybe some parameters that are positive could be adjusted to negative and vice versa. For example, in the current top params, params[8] and [9] are 6. Maybe trying to set them to lower values, but that's already tried. Alternatively, perhaps adjusting other parameters that are not as high.

Looking at the first example, params[4] is 5.3 and params[5] is 6. Maybe increasing params[4] to 6.3 (invalid) or decreasing to 4.3. But 4.3 is already tried in some examples. Alternatively, changing params[5] from 6 to 5.0. But that's already in some examples.

Alternatively, looking at params[6] and [7], which are -6 and 6. Maybe changing those. For example, params[6] is -6, so adding 1.0 makes it -5.0. But that's already in some examples. Similarly, params[7] is 6, so subtracting 1.0 to 5.0. But that's also tried.

Hmm, maybe looking for parameters that haven't been adjusted much. For instance, params[1] is consistently 1.3 in the top examples. Maybe trying to change that. For example, from 1.3 to 2.3 or 0.3. Let's see if that's in the examples. The first example has 1.3, others have similar. So maybe trying 2.3 or 0.3. But need to check if those are in the existing examples. The user hasn't provided those, so maybe it's safe to try.

Alternatively, looking at the other parameters. For example, params[2] is -6 in some cases. Maybe changing that to -5.0. But that's already in some examples. 

Alternatively, maybe looking at params[3], which is 6 in some cases. Changing that to 5.0. But that's also tried.

Wait, the user's instruction says not to propose previously seen params. So I need to make sure that the new params aren't in the given examples. Let me check the existing params again. For example, the first example has params[0] as 6, params[1] as 1.3, params[2] as -6, params[3] as 6, params[4] as 5.3, params[5] as 6, params[6] as -6, params[7] as 6, params[8] as 6, params[9] as 6. 

If I change params[1] from 1.3 to 2.3, that's a new value. Similarly, changing params[1] to 0.3. Let's try that. For example, changing params[1] to 0.3. That might be a new direction. 

Alternatively, changing params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3 (invalid) or 4.3 (already tried). Maybe trying a different parameter. 

Alternatively, looking at params[8] and [9], which are 6 in the top example. Maybe setting them to 5.0. But that's already tried. 

Hmm, maybe trying to adjust params[0] from 6 to 5.0, but that's already in some examples. 

Alternatively, trying to change params[2] from -6 to -7 (invalid) or -5.0 (already tried). 

Wait, the user's instruction says during exploration, use a search step size of 1.0. So for each parameter, we can adjust by ±1.0. Let's pick a parameter that hasn't been adjusted much. For example, in the first example, params[8] and [9] are 6. Maybe changing them to 5.0. But that's already tried. 

Alternatively, looking at the other parameters. Maybe params[4] is 5.3. Changing that to 6.3 (invalid) or 4.3 (already tried). 

Alternatively, looking at params[5] which is 6. Changing that to 5.0. But that's already tried. 

Hmm, maybe trying to adjust params[0] from 6 to 5.0, but that's already in some examples. 

Wait, maybe looking at the other examples. The 15th example has params[4] as 6, which is different from the others. But that example has a lower reward. Maybe that's a direction to explore. 

Alternatively, trying to set params[4] to 6.0. But that's not in the current top examples. Let me check. The first example has params[4] as 5.3. The 13th example has params[4] as 6.0. So that's already tried. 

This is tricky. Maybe trying to adjust multiple parameters at once. For example, changing params[1] from 1.3 to 2.3 and params[8] from 6 to 5.0. Let's see if that's a new combination. 

Alternatively, changing params[0] from 6 to 5.0 (already tried), but maybe changing params[2] from -6 to -5.0 (already tried). 

Wait, perhaps looking at the other parameters. For example, in the first example, params[6] is -6. Maybe changing that to -5.0 (already tried) or -7.0 (invalid). 

Alternatively, changing params[7] from 6 to 5.0 (already tried). 

Hmm. Maybe the best approach is to take one of the existing high-performing parameters and make a small adjustment. For example, take the first example (params with reward 497.35) and adjust one parameter by ±1.0. Let's pick params[8] from 6 to 5.0. But that's already tried. How about adjusting params[9] from 6 to 5.0. That's also tried. 

Alternatively, adjusting params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3 (invalid) or 4.3 (already tried). 

Wait, maybe adjusting params[1] from 1.3 to 2.3. Let's try that. So, in the first example, changing params[1] from 1.3 to 2.3. That's a new value. Let's see if that's possible. 

So the new params would be: params[0]:6, params[1]:2.3, params[2]:-6, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5تقار:6, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:6, params[9]:6. 

But need to check if this combination is in any existing examples. The user hasn't provided that, so it's safe. 

Alternatively, changing params[1] to 0.3. That's another possibility. 

Alternatively, changing params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3 (invalid) or 4.3 (already in some examples). 

Another idea: looking at the other examples, maybe the 15th example has params[4] as 6.0, which is different. But that example has a lower reward. Maybe trying to combine that with other parameters. 

Alternatively, trying to adjust params[8] and [9] to lower values, but that's already tried. 

Hmm. Given the constraints, maybe the best bet is to adjust params[1] from 1.3 to 2.3 or 0.3, as those are not in the existing examples. Let's go with that. So, changing params[1] to 2.3. That's a new value. Let's proceed with that.
