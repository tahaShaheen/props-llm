SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

Now you are at iteration 327 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has provided a bunch of training examples for the CartPole environment with a linear policy. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward, which they mentioned should be around 500. The current iteration is 327 out of 400, so we're in the later stages. The previous examples show that several params configurations have achieved 500.00, but there are also some with lower rewards.

First, I need to look at the existing params that gave 500.00. For example, the first entry has params[0] to params[9] as [6, 2.3, -5, 6, 5.3, 6, -6, 6, 5, 5]. The next entries vary slightly, like params[3] being 5 or 6, params[4] being 5.2 or 5.3, and params[6] being -5 or -6. The ones that gave lower rewards had changes in params[1], params[2], params[4], params[6], and params[8].

Since the user wants to avoid previously seen params, I need to find a new combination. The current best is 500.00, but maybe there's a way to tweak some parameters to get even higher. However, the user mentioned that if we're below 500, we should explore instead of exploit. But since we're already at 500, maybe we can try small perturbations.

Looking at the params that achieved 500.00, they have params[0] and params[3] at 6, which might be contributing to high rewards. However, some entries with lower values in those positions still achieved 500. So maybe there's a range of values that work.

The user's instruction says during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. Since the current iteration is high, maybe we should explore by changing some parameters by 1.0. Let's check which parameters have been tried. For example, params[2] has been -5 and -6. Maybe trying -4 or -7? But the range is [-6.0, 6.0], so -7 is out of bounds. So maybe -4.0?

Looking at params[8] and params[9], they are 5 in most cases. Maybe trying 6 or 4? But the previous example where params[8] was 6 gave a lower reward (347.25), so that's worse. Maybe trying 4.0?

Alternatively, looking at params[1], which is 2.3 in most cases. The example with 2.4 gave 494.00, which is lower. What about 1.3 or 3.3? The 3.3 case gave 381.40, which is worse. So maybe 2.3 is a sweet spot. But perhaps adjusting it slightly, like 2.2 or 2.4? But the user wants to avoid previous params, so 2.4 was tried and gave lower reward.

Looking at params[4], which is around 5.3. In one case, it was 5.4 and gave 498.90, which is slightly lower. What if we try 5.2 or 5.5? But the step size is 1.0, so maybe 5.3 ±1.0. However, 5.3 +1.0 is 6.3, which is over the limit. So maybe 4.3? But that was tried and gave 499.35, which is lower than 500.

Hmm. Maybe changing params[6], which is -6. In some cases, it was -5. Let's see: when params[6] was -5, the reward was 498.55. So maybe changing it to -6.0 again? But that was already tried. Alternatively, trying -6.0 and adjusting other parameters.

Wait, the user says to explore with step size 1.0. So perhaps take a parameter that's at the edge and move it by 1.0. For example, params[0] is 6.0, which is the upper limit. Can't go higher. Similarly, params[3] is 6.0. So maybe lower those by 1.0 to 5.0? But that might decrease the reward.

Alternatively, look for parameters that are not at the extremes. For example, params[1] is 2.3. Maybe changing it by 1.0 to 3.3 or 1.3. But 3.3 was tried and gave lower reward. What about 1.3? Not sure. Let's think.

Another approach: check which parameters have not been varied much. For example, params[8] and params[9] are always 5.0. Maybe trying 6.0 or 4.0. But when params[8] was 6, the reward was lower. What about 4.0? Let's try that. So change params[8] from 5.0 to 4.0, keeping others the same. But need to ensure that this hasn't been tried before. Looking at the examples, there's one where params[8] was 6, but not 4. So that's a new param.

Alternatively, change params[9] from 5.0 to 6.0. But that might not be effective. Alternatively, change params[5] from 6.0 to 5.0. Let's see. But need to avoid previous params.

Another thought: the current best params have params[2] as -5.0. What if we try -6.0 for params[2]? But in the examples, when params[2] was -6, the reward was 430.60, which is lower. So maybe not.

Alternatively, look for parameters that are in the middle. For example, params[7] is 6.0. Maybe lower it to 5.0? But that's a step of 1.0. Let's try that.

So, the plan is to take a parameter that's at a high value and lower it by 1.0, or vice versa, to explore new regions. Since the current best is 500, but the user says the global optimum should be around 500, maybe we're already at the maximum. However, the user might be expecting a slight improvement, but given that the examples show 500.00, perhaps that's the maximum.

But the user says that if below 500, explore. Since we're at 500, maybe we should try to find a better one. However, the examples show that even with some variations, the reward remains 500. So perhaps the maximum is indeed 500, and the current params are already optimal.

But the user's instruction says to explore with step size 1.0. So, perhaps we need to make a change. Let's pick a parameter that's in the middle and adjust it. For example, params[1] is 2.3. Let's try increasing it by 1.0 to 3.3 (but that was tried and gave lower reward). Alternatively, decrease it by 1.0 to 1.3. Let's try that. So:

params[0]: 6.0
params[1]: 1.3
params[2]: -5.0
params[3]: 6.0
params[4]: 5.3
params[5]: 6.0
params[6]: -6.0
params[7]: 6.0
params[8]: 5.0
params[9]: 5.0

This hasn't been tried before. Let's check if this is a new combination. The existing examples have params[1] as 2.3, 2.4, 3.3. So 1.3 is new. This could be a candidate for exploration.
