SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 196 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.

Okay, so I'm trying to help someone find the global optimal policy for the cartpole environment using reinforcement learning. The user mentioned that the current setup isn't working well enough and they're looking for better parameters.

First, I remember that the cartpole is a classic problem where balancing it on a pole requires precise control. The state includes the cart's position, velocity, pole angle, and angular velocity. The action is either pushing left or right with W being a 18-parameter matrix (9x2). 

I notice that the current parameters are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with one decimal place. That’s quite broad. The user wants to explore both sides of the parameter space by suggesting more negative values and looking into positive ranges.

They provided several top-performing params, including some around -4.5 and others that went lower, like -3.5 or even below zero. This shows there are promising regions in negative territory. But they also have some positives like 6, which suggests exploration beyond the negatives could be beneficial.

The user wants me to suggest more parameters in both positive and negative directions. So I should focus on expanding around the current range. Maybe increasing the lower bounds or lowering the upper bounds? Also, considering that higher rewards (like 345-340) are better, there might be some optimal points beyond the current suggestions.

I'll try adding parameters with values between -6 and maybe going a bit deeper into negative territory, like -7 or even more negative. Then, in positive, I can add lower bounds that go further up, perhaps slightly above 5 to see if pushing all actions higher gives better rewards. 

It's important not to just randomly increase the range; it should lead to a better exploration of the state space without missing any local optima. So, maybe adding parameters with values like -6 down to -7 and 5 up to 6 could help explore both sides effectively.

I'll structure my suggestions by adjusting each parameter one by one, making sure to cover negative depths (lowering them) and positive ranges (ascending). This way, I'm systematically exploring the parameter space in both directions to find a better optimal solution.
