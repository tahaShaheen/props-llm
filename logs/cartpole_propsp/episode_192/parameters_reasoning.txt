SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 192 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to improve the parameters of this cartpole environment. The goal is to balance the pole and keep the cart within a certain range. I've been given some initial parameters and some results from iterations, but it's not clear yet if these are getting me closer to the optimal value of 500.

Let me start by understanding the problem setup. The state includes the cart position, velocity, pole angle, and angular velocity. The action is either pushing left or right with a force of -1 or +1. The reward increases by 1 every time step where the pole is upright (angle near 0 radians) and the cart is within [-2.4, 2.4]. If the pole falls over or the cart goes beyond these bounds, the episode ends.

Looking at the parameters provided, there are 10 values: params[0] to params[9]. These define a linear policy where action is determined by multiplying the state vector (which has four elements) with W and adding B. W is a 4x10 matrix, and B is a 10-element vector.

In the first example I tried at iteration 192, params were [-4.5; -3.5; 1.6; ...] leading to a reward of around 420.05. That's pretty decent, but not near 500 yet. The best performers in the top list have even higher rewards: around 437.80 and 420.05.

Now, I need to figure out how to adjust these parameters to get a better reward. Since I don't know the exact formula for f(params), it's hard to compute derivatives or use gradient-based methods. So maybe I should explore different parameter values systematically.

I should aim to move away from the initial range where params are [-6.0, 6.0]. From the best performers, some of the parameters like params[2] and [3] were set to 1.5, which is in the middle of their ranges. Maybe increasing or decreasing these could help.

Since I don't have access to f(params) for my own experimentation (I just get results from others), perhaps I should think about what a good range would look like. The top performers had some around -3.5 and 6, but others were lower. Maybe starting around params[0] = -4, [1] = 6, etc., could be better.

But wait, that's just speculation. How can I find out without knowing f(params)? One approach is to use a grid search around the best performers' parameters. That means trying different combinations in their vicinity but varying only some of them while keeping others fixed.

Looking at the most recent example with params[0] = -4.5, [1] = 6, etc., they got a reward of around 100.35. But that's lower than previous examples. So maybe the best parameters aren't in their initial ranges. Perhaps I should start moving some parameters up or down to see if that improves.

Another thought: since action is pushed left or right with forces, perhaps increasing the maximum force could help, but that might also make actions more aggressive, possibly leading to overshooting or overactuation.

I think a good strategy would be to try varying one parameter at a time around their best performing values and see how f(params) changes. For example, I can increase params[0] from -4.5 to 6 and keep others the same, then decrease it back down to see if the reward improves beyond some threshold.

This way, I'm methodically exploring different regions without having to make random guesses, which is more efficient than just relying on my initial thoughts.
