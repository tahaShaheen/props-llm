SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 115 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has provided a bunch of previous parameter sets and their corresponding rewards. The goal is to find the optimal parameters that maximize the episodic reward, aiming for around 500. The current iteration is 115 out of 400, so there's still time to explore.

Looking at the examples, the highest reward so far is 497.35 with params that have several 6s and some negatives. But the user mentioned that the global optimum should be around 500, so we need to explore more. The previous attempts have mostly been tweaking the parameters around certain values, but maybe there's a better combination.

The policy is linear, so the parameters W and B are crucial. The action is determined by the maximum of the state multiplied by W plus B. To maximize the reward, the policy needs to balance the cart effectively. Maybe some parameters that were previously set to 6 could be adjusted lower, or some negatives could be changed. 

Since the user said during exploration, use a step size of 1.0, I should consider making larger changes to explore new areas. For example, in the previous examples, params[2] and params[6] are often -6 or -5. Maybe trying -6.0 for some and adjusting others. Also, looking at the B terms (params 8 and 9), they are mostly 6 or 5. Maybe increasing them further? But they are already at the upper limit of 6.0. Wait, the parameters are in the range [-6.0, 6.0], so they can't go beyond that. 

Another observation: the first example has params[0] and [1] as 6 and 1.3, which might be important. Maybe keeping those high, but adjusting other parameters. For instance, in the first example, params[2] is -6, params[3] is 6, params[4] is 5.3, params[5] is 6, params[6] is -6, params[7] is 6, and B is all 6s. The reward is 497.35. Maybe tweaking some of the middle parameters. Like, perhaps increasing params[4] to 6.0 instead of 5.3. But in the first example, params[4] is 5.3. However, in another example, params[4] was 6.0, but the reward was lower. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe there's a balance between different parameters.

Alternatively, maybe the B terms (params 8 and 9) are too high. In the first example, they are both 6.0. Maybe lowering them slightly could help? But how? The user said to explore with step size 1.0. So maybe changing some parameters by 1.0 from their current values. For example, if params[8] is 6.0, maybe try 5.0. But that's a step of -1.0. But the user said during exploration, use step size of 1.0. So perhaps making larger changes to explore new regions.

Looking at the current top parameters, maybe trying to vary some of the parameters that have been fixed. For example, in the first example, params[2] is -6, but in other examples, it's -5. Maybe trying -6.0 for params[2] and see. Also, params[6] is -6 in some cases. Maybe changing that to -5.0 or -6.0 again. 

Another approach: since the reward is around 497, which is close to 500, maybe small adjustments could push it higher. But the user emphasized that if we're below 500, we should explore instead of exploit. So perhaps making some bold changes. For example, changing params[0] from 6.0 to 5.0, but that's a step of -1.0. Alternatively, changing params[1] from 1.3 to 2.3 or 0.3. 

Wait, the step size is 1.0, so changes should be in increments of 1.0. For example, if a parameter is 1.3, changing it to 2.3 or 0.3. But the parameters have to be in increments of 0.1 (since they have 1 decimal place). So maybe changing by 1.0 steps. For example, if a parameter is 1.3, adding or subtracting 1.0 would take it to 2.3 or 0.3. 

Looking at the previous examples, maybe trying to adjust params[4] and params[5], which were 5.3 and 6.0 in the first example. If I increase params[4] to 6.0 and decrease params[5] to 5.0, but that's a step of +0.7 and -1.0. Not sure. Alternatively, trying to change params[2] and params[6] from -6 to -5, but that might not be helpful. 

Alternatively, maybe the B terms (params 8 and 9) are too high. Let's say in the first example, they are both 6.0. Maybe lowering them to 5.0. But that's a step of -1.0. However, the user said to explore with step size of 1.0. So perhaps trying that. 

Another thought: the parameters in the W matrix for the cart position (params 0 and 1) are 6 and 1.3. Maybe increasing params[1] to 2.3, but that's a step of +1.0. Or decreasing to 0.3. 

This is a bit tricky. Since the user wants exploration, perhaps making a few parameters change by 1.0. For example, take the first example's params and adjust some. Let's say, change params[2] from -6 to -5 (step of +1.0), and params[6] from -6 to -5. Also, change params[8] and [9] from 6 to 5. That might be a way to explore. 

Alternatively, take a parameter set that's lower and make changes. For instance, in one of the lower examples, params[0] was 5.0, and maybe increasing that to 6.0. But that's already done in some examples. 

Wait, the user said not to propose previously seen params. So need to ensure that the new params are not in the examples provided. Looking at the previous examples, the first one has params[0] 6, [1] 1.3, [2] -6, [3] 6, [4] 5.3, [5] 6, [6] -6, [7] 6, [8] 6, [9] 6. So any new param should differ from that. 

Maybe changing params[4] from 5.3 to 6.0 (step +0.7, but since the step size is 1.0, perhaps not). Wait, the step size is 1.0, so changes should be in whole numbers? Wait, the parameters have 1 decimal place, but the step size is 1.0. So changing a parameter by 1.0 would be adding or subtracting 1.0. For example, if a parameter is 1.3, adding 1.0 makes it 2.3, subtracting makes it 0.3. 

So, let's take the first example's params and change some parameters by 1.0. For example, change params[2] from -6 to -5 (adding 1.0), and params[6] from -6 to -5 (adding 1.0). Also, change params[8] and [9] from 6 to 5 (subtracting 1.0). That would be a new param set. 

So the new params would be:

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 1.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -5; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5. 

But wait, this is similar to one of the previous examples (like the one with f=486.85). So that's already been tried. So need to avoid that. 

Alternatively, change params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3? But the parameters are capped at 6.0. So can't. So maybe change params[4] to 6.0 (since 5.3 + 0.7 is not a step of 1.0). Wait, the step size is 1.0, so changing from 5.3 to 6.3 is not allowed. So the maximum is 6.0. So maybe changing params[4] to 6.0. But that's a change of +0.7, which is less than 1.0. Not sure if that's allowed. The user said during exploration, use step size of 1.0. So perhaps only changes that are multiples of 撵. 

This is a bit confusing. Maybe the best way is to take a parameter that's been in the examples and change one of the parameters by 1.0. For example, take the first example and change params[2] from -6 to -5 (step +1.0), and also change params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3 (but that's over the limit). Not allowed. So maybe change params[4] to 6.0 (which is +0.7, but maybe that's acceptable as a small step). However, the user said step size of 1.0. So perhaps only changes that are exactly 1.0. 

Alternatively, take a parameter that's 1.3 and change it to 2.3 (adding 1.0). For example, params[1] is 1.3. Changing it to 2.3. That would be a new parameter set. 

So the new params would be:

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -6; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 6; params[9]: 6. 

This is a new set, not seen before. Maybe this could lead to a higher reward. 

Alternatively, changing params[2] from -6 to -7? No, the parameters are capped at -6.0. So can't go lower. 

Another idea: change params[3] from 6 to 5 (subtracting 1.0). So:

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 1.3; params[2]: -6; params[3]: 5; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 6; params[9]: 6. 

This is a new set. Maybe that could be explored. 

But how to decide which change to make? Since the user wants exploration, perhaps making a few different changes. However, the assistant can only propose one set. 

Looking at the previous examples, the highest reward is 497.35. To explore, maybe changing one of the parameters that was previously at a high value. For example, params[4] is 5.3. Changing it to 6.0 (adding 0.7) might not be a full step, but perhaps the user allows that as part of exploration. Alternatively, changing params[1] from 1.3 to 2.3 (adding 1.0). 

Let me go with changing params[1] from 1.3 to 2.3. So the new params would be:

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -6; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 6; params[9]: 6. 

This is a new set, not seen before. Let's check if it's in the previous examples. The first example had params[1] as 1.3, so changing to 2.3 is new. This might be a good candidate for exploration.
