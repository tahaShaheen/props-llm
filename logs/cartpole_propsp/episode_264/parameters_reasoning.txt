SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 264 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to help this user who's working on an RL optimization problem using policy gradients. The environment is the cartpole, and they're using a linear policy with 18 parameters. They want me to find the global optimal policy by maximizing the episodic reward.

First, I'll need to understand their setup. The state is [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity], each with specific ranges. Their current policy has these as inputs and linear weights and biases. They interact in a way where they try different parameters and see how f(params) changes.

The user provided some examples of params values and the corresponding reward. The top 8 examples have varying combinations of positive and negative numbers, but none seem to reach 500 yet. Their goal is around 500, so they're looking for a high reward which suggests balancing pushing too far in both directions without making the system unstable.

I should consider the dynamics here. A cartpole upright on a cart is inherently unstable unless pushed carefully. Each push (action) can correct the pole angle but also affects the cart's velocity. The reward function rewards being within bounds and pole upright, so it's crucial to keep the cart stable.

Looking at the examples provided, some have higher rewards by having more positive parameters, others negative. It seems like a combination of pushing left and right (action) along with adjusting pole angle is needed. For instance, params[0] and [1] being 6 are strong pushes in both directions, but sometimes they result in lower rewards because the pole might get too upright or the cart might move beyond its limits.

The exploration step size is set to 1.0 during parameter exploration. That means when trying new values, they'll try integers from -6 to 6 for each parameter, which gives a manageable search space without making it too extensive.

To find the global optimum around 500, I think they need to balance positive actions (pushing left and right) with adjustments in pole angle. Maybe some negative actions could help keep the pole upright if the pole gets too tipped by excessive pushes. However, since the reward decreases for extreme positions, balancing these is tricky.

I should guide them on how to adjust each parameter systematically. Perhaps starting with small changes in positive actions before testing more aggressive ones. They'll need to run multiple episodes to see which parameter combinations yield higher rewards, using techniques like Q-learning or SARSA in a tabular form since it's a small state space.

Also, considering the state space size is manageable (only 4 parameters each up to 6 decimal places), they can use a grid search approach with all possible values within that range. They might need to increase the number of iterations beyond their current setup if starting too quickly, but perhaps exploring more than 400 steps could help find a better balance.

In summary, I'll instruct them on systematically varying each parameter and using episodes to evaluate rewards, adjusting as needed based on feedback from Q-learning updates. This approach should help them converge towards the optimal policy that maximizes their reward.
