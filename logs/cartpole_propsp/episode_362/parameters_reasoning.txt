SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 362 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help with this cartpole environment problem where I need to find the global optimal policy. The user mentioned that the current parameters they've set yield a reward of around 500, and they want me to search for better values.

First, I remember that the cartpole is an episodic task, so each state transition gives points based on whether the pole stays upright or the cart goes out of bounds. The goal is to maximize this reward by keeping the pole upright and the cart controlled within its range.

The policy they're using is linear, with a certain structure involving parameters from W and B. I think the current params are around -6 to 6 but have specific values that might not be optimal. They've shared some top-performing parameters where f(params) is exactly 500, which suggests these are good starting points.

I should explore both higher and lower parameter values because sometimes a slightly negative parameter can lead to better results due to the system's dynamics, especially if the cart movement creates some instability or sensitivity.

For each parameter I adjust, I need to simulate the environment step by step. Since it's 400 steps, that's a lot of simulations, but maybe I can find a pattern or use some heuristics to avoid doing them all manually. Perhaps starting with symmetric ranges for parameters and then expanding towards higher values if needed.

I'll start by slightly increasing each parameter beyond their current values because the cartpole problem might benefit from pushing the cart further while balancing the pole. After that, I can explore decreasing some parameters in both positive and negative directions to see if any improvements occur, especially since sometimes a slight negative can compensate for others' positives.

After setting initial bounds around 500, I'll test parameters within wider ranges until an improvement is found. It's important to note that the system might have plateaus where no change improves the reward, so I need to be methodical about each adjustment.

I should also consider using tools or libraries if possible, but since this is a thought process, maybe simulating it manually with some structured approach would work better.

I'll outline the steps: start with current params, adjust some parameters up and others down, simulate, check reward, adjust as needed, repeat until no improvement.
