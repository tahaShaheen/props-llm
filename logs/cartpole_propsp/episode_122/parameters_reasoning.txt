SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I need to help find the optimal parameters for the cartpole environment using a linear policy. The user provided some examples of parameter values and their corresponding episodic rewards. Let me think through how I would approach this.

First, understanding the problem: The cartpole is a classic RL task where an agent must balance a pole on a cart. The state includes position, velocity, angle, and angular velocity. The policy uses these states to choose actions (push left or right). My goal is to maximize the reward by adjusting the policy's parameters.

Looking at the provided examples:

- params[0]: -5, others around that region.
- The rewards vary from 188.90 to 326.60, which are positive values indicating good performance.

The user also mentioned that the global optimum is around 500 reward, so our current best (around 326) isn't that great yet. They want us to explore more by varying parameters and see how rewards change.

I should start by thinking about how changing each parameter affects the reward. Since it's a linear policy, each parameter directly multiplies the corresponding state components in the action evaluation function.

One approach is to vary one parameter at a time while keeping others fixed to find which has the most impact on reward. For example, increasing params[0] from -5 to -6 might have a significant effect because it's a larger magnitude and likely affects the velocity term more due to the structure of state @ W + B.

I also need to consider that higher values in certain parameters can both increase and decrease the pole's balance. For instance, pushing too far left or right (higher params[0]) might destabilize the system or even send the cart beyond its bounds, which would end the episode with a reward of -1 per step.

Moreover, states like velocity (params[1], [3]) and angular velocity (params[2], [4]) are critical. If these are too high or too low, it could cause excessive force, but since the policy is linear, each parameter contributes independently.

I should also look for any trade-offs between different parameters. For example, balancing a pole requires sufficient control of its position and angular velocity, so adjusting these parameters to encourage faster responses might improve the episode length without causing instability.

In the next steps, I'll adjust each parameter incrementally, observe how the reward changes, and adjust others accordingly. This iterative process should help me find the optimal balance that maximizes the episodic reward.
