SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 72 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of training examples with their corresponding rewards. The goal is to find the optimal parameters that maximize the episodic reward, aiming for around 500. From the examples given, the highest reward so far is 448.10. The user mentioned that if we're below 500, we should explore instead of exploit. 

Looking at the examples, the top ones have params like params[0] and [3] at 6, params[2] and [6] at negative values, and params[4] and [5] around 5.3 and 2.7. The bias terms (params[8] and [9]) are mostly 5 or 6. But since the current best is 448, which is below 500, the user wants exploration.

The exploration step size is 1.0, so I need to adjust parameters by ±1 from the current values. Let's look at the current top params. For instance, the first example with 448.10 has params[0]=6, [1]=1.3, [2]=-4, [3]=6, [4]=5.3, [5]=4.7, [6]=-5, [7]=6, [8]=5, [9]=5. Maybe we can tweak some of these. 

Looking at params[5] which is 4.7, increasing it by 1.0 to 5.7 might help. Also, params[2] is -4; decreasing it to -5 could be an exploration step. Similarly, params[6] is -5; maybe increasing it to -4. Let's try changing a few parameters. Also, the bias terms are at 5 and 5. Maybe increasing them to 6. 

Another thought: in the current top params, params[5] is 4.7. Maybe increasing that to 5.7. Also, params[4] is 5.3, perhaps increasing to 6.3. But wait, the parameters are capped at 6.0. So 5.3 can go up to 6.0. Let me check the allowed range: parameters are in [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place. So 5.3 can be increased by 0.7 to reach 6.0. But the step size is 1.0, so maybe that's too big. Alternatively, maybe adjust other parameters.

Wait, the exploration step size is 1.0, but the parameters are in 1 decimal place. So, adding or subtracting 1.0 would be a big jump. For example, if a parameter is 5.3, adding 1.0 would take it to 6.3, which is over the 6.0 limit. So perhaps we need to stay within bounds. So, for parameters that are at 6.0, we can't increase them further. Similarly for -6.0.

Looking at the current top example, maybe we can adjust params[2] from -4 to -5 (a step of -1.0), which is allowed. Also, params[6] is -5; maybe changing it to -6. Also, check the bias terms. Let's try modifying a few parameters. For instance, changing params[2] from -4 to -5, params[6] from -5 to -6, and maybe increase params[5] from 4.7 to 5.7. But wait, 4.7 +1.0 is 5.7, which is within the range. 

So, new params could be:
params[0]: 6 (no change)
params[1]: 1.3 (no change)
params[2]: -5 (from -4)
params[3]: 6 (no change)
params[4]: 5.3 (no change)
params[5]: 5.7 (increase by 1.0)
params[6]: -6 (from -5)
params[7]: 6 (no change)
params[8]: 6 (increase from 5)
params[9]: 6 (increase from 5)

This would be an exploration step. Let me check if these changes are within the bounds. All parameters are within [-6.0, 6.0]. Yes. 

Alternatively, maybe other parameters can be adjusted. For example, params[4] is 5.3. Increasing it by 1.0 would take it to 6.3, which is over. So we can only increase it to 6.0. So maybe set params[4] to 6.0. But the step size is 1.0, so changing from 5.3 to 6.3 isn't allowed. So perhaps that's not feasible. 

Another idea: looking at the current top params, maybe the bias terms are low. Increasing them from 5 to 6. Also, maybe adjusting params[7] from 6 to 5. But that's a step of -1.0. Not sure. 

I think the first approach of changing params[2], [5], [6], [8], [9] is a valid exploration step. Let's go with that.
