SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to find the global optimal policy for this cartpole environment using a linear policy. The user provided some training examples with parameters and their corresponding episodic rewards. They want me to propose new parameters that might maximize the reward f(params) at each step.

First, let me understand the setup. The state is [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]. The action space is binary: 0 for left push and 1 for right push. The reward is +1 every time step when the pole is upright (within -0.418 of 0 radians) and the cart is within [-2.4, 2.4] position.

The policy is linear, meaning action = argmax(state @ W + B). So, each parameter in W affects the prediction for one action. Since it's a linear function, higher parameters could mean more influence on the action choice. But since the reward depends on being upright and within bounds, having some balance between pole angle and velocity is important.

Looking at the existing examples, all have params[0] around 6 to 7. But when I saw one with params[0]: 6.6, it had a higher reward of 157.70, which suggests that higher params might be beneficial if they can compensate for the pole's instability.

I should explore both positive and negative directions for each parameter. For example, increasing params[2] (pole angle) could potentially help stabilize the pole by pushing it back up when pushed too far. But I also need to consider how this affects velocity and pole angular velocity.

Wait, the state includes cart_position (-4.8 to 4.8), so higher positions are better. Cart_velocity is from -inf to inf; higher means faster movement.pole_angle is within -0.418 to 0.418 rad, so higher means more upright. pole_angular_velocity affects how quickly the pole rotates.

If I set params[0] higher (e.g., 6.6), it might help in some steps where pushing left is needed when cart is too far or pole is unstable. But I have to balance this with increasing params[1], which affects cart velocity. More negative values could slow down the cart, making it harder to balance.

Similarly, for params[2], higher means more upright pole, but if pushed too much, it can fall over, so maybe a moderate value might be best. For params[3], since action is 0 or 1, whether increasing this parameter helps in choosing when to push left vs right?

Hmm, perhaps setting some parameters as slightly negative could allow for more flexibility in the actions. But I need to make sure that the overall reward isn't reduced too much.

Wait, looking at one of the examples with params[0] = 6.6, it had a high reward. That suggests that higher params might be useful when needed but also have some downsides. Maybe increasing some parameters while decreasing others could balance things out better.

Another approach is to try parameter values beyond current max and min. For example, for params[8], which affects pole angular velocity, setting it lower might help stabilize the pole without making the cart move too fast. Similarly, lowering params[9] if it's pushing too much would slow down the pole rotation.

I should also consider whether adding some negative parameters could allow for more precise control in certain states. For instance, perhaps having a slightly negative params[2] or params[3] can help balance out when there are errors in pole angle or angular velocity.

But I need to make sure that any changes don't harm the reward too much. So maybe trying moderate variations around current values and evaluating their impact on f(params) would be better than extreme changes.
