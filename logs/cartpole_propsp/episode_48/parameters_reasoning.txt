SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to find the optimal parameters for this cartpole environment. Let me start by understanding what's given.

The environment is a cartpole where the pole needs to stay upright and the cart within certain bounds. The state consists of four values: cart position, cart velocity, pole angle, and pole angular velocity. The action is either pushing left or right, represented as 0 or 1 in parameters W and B.

From the policy description, it's a linear policy with 18 parameters. So each parameter can be adjusted to influence the action selection. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward, which is +1 for every time step pole is upright and cart within bounds, otherwise, the episode ends.

Now, in the exploration phase, I can choose any of the 10 params values from -6.0 to 6.0 with one decimal place. The user will provide these values and get an f(params) value and current iteration (48 out of 400).

In my first interaction, I'll select some parameters and get back their reward. But since the user is following up in real-time, I might need to experiment further.

Since the global optimum is around 500 episodes, it suggests that a good policy needs enough exploration to balance local search effectively without getting stuck locally optimal.

I should consider both positive and negative values for the parameters because adjusting them can either help the pole stay upright or keep the cart stable. Also, some parameters might have more weight in the reward function.

Let me think about potential high reward states: when the pole is balanced and within bounds, a lot of rewards are given. So, policies that maintain balance and containment would perform well. But I need to explore different parameter values to see which combination works best.

I should also consider the cart's velocity and angle—perhaps adjusting parameters related to pole stability (W2 and B3) could help prevent the pole from toppling or causing the cart to oscillate too much.

Maybe starting with some positive parameters that might stabilize the system. For example, having higher W values in certain positions could make the action selection more favorable for keeping the pole upright.

I also need to consider possible negative parameters that might increase exploration by trying different actions. This way, I can see if moving left or right helps overall performance.

Wait, but since we're exploring and looking for a global optimum, maybe there's a balance between favoring some actions over others without getting stuck in a local maximum.

Perhaps experimenting with parameter combinations where W4 and B5 are adjusted to allow for more pole angle adjustments while keeping the cart stable. That way, both the pole and cart are balanced.

I think I should try parameters that might increase the chance of selecting the correct action (pushing left or right) without making other actions too dominant. Maybe some positive parameters in W3 and B4, but others set to lower values so they don't completely dominate nearby options.

Also, adjusting W5 and B6 for pole angular velocity could help prevent the pole from flipping over by ensuring it's not tilted at 90 degrees or more.

Another idea is to try having both positive and negative parameters in different positions. For example, some parameters positive, others negative, which might allow the policy to explore both left and right actions without being too biased towards one direction.

But since this is an exploration phase, maybe starting with small adjustments can help see how each parameter contributes. Maybe tweak a few key parameters before moving on to more varied combinations.

I should also be cautious about overexploring—each trial could take time because I need to ensure the cart doesn't go out of bounds or pole falls over. So, carefully choosing parameters that keep the system within manageable ranges is important.

Overall, my strategy would be to incrementally adjust parameter values around what's currently in use and observe how each change affects the reward. Over time, through exploration, I can identify which combinations maximize the episodic reward effectively.
