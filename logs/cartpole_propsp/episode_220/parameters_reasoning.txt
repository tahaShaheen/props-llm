SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to find the optimal parameters for this cartpole environment using a linear policy. The user has given me some specific values and wants me to propose new parameters that maximize the episodic reward f(params). 

First, let's understand the problem. The cartpole is a classic control task where you push a pole upright on a cart without it slipping off. The state includes the position, velocity of the cart, angle of the pole, and its angular velocity. The goal is to keep the pole upright within -0.418 radians and the cart tightly inside [-2.4, 2.4]. 

The policy is linear with parameters W and B. Each action (push left or push right) is given by argmax(state @ W + B), where state is [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]. The reward function f(params) gives the episodic reward.

Looking at the initial proposal, params[0] is -6.0, and so on up to params[9], which are various values with specific decimals. But when I look at the top performing parameters, they have more positive values in some positions, like params[2] being 1.5, 1.8, etc., and others like params[7] and params[3] as -1 or -4.5.

The user mentioned that the global optimum is around 500. Since we're starting at iteration 220, I need to find parameters that are better than those in the top 7 and possibly improve further.

I notice that some parameters in the current run (params) have higher rewards: for example, params[2] is 1.8, which is high. Similarly, params[6] is -3.5 but with a reward of 404.7, which is good. So maybe pushing more into certain directions can lead to better rewards.

I should focus on increasing some parameters and decreasing others where they might contribute negatively. For instance, if I increase params[2], which affects the pole angle's velocity in the reward function (penalty for not keeping it upright). Also, looking at params[6] being negative but having a high reward suggests that when the pole is slightly tilted (but within bounds), it still rewards well.

I should also consider the cart position and velocity. If increasing the cart's speed (params[4] maybe) could help move it beyond -inf to stay within [-2.4, 2.4]. Similarly, if decreasing params[3], which might affect angular velocity, perhaps helping control the pole better.

Maybe starting with some positive changes in params[0], [1], and [6], and negative changes in [7] or others that penalize deviations from being upright. For example, increasing W's parameters to move towards higher rewards where needed.

I should be careful not to overshoot the reward values too much, as very high rewards might make the policy learn faster but could also lead to instability if not balanced. Perhaps a gradual increase in some parameters and a slight decrease elsewhere to find a sweet spot that keeps f(params) around 500.

Also, looking at params[8] which is -2.5 and [9], maybe increasing them could help with the pole's angular velocity penalty or improve control over it.

I think I'll focus on adjusting some parameters in [1], [3], [6], and others to see how they contribute positively and negatively to f(params). I need to ensure that each adjustment is within the -6.0 to 6.0 range, with one decimal place.

After making these adjustments, I should test whether the reward increases while keeping the cart stable. If it does, then I can proceed with further optimization. If not, maybe I need to tweak more parameters or explore other directions.
