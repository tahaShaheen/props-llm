SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to find the global optimal policy for the cartpole environment using a linear policy. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward f(params). The parameters are given with 10 values ranging from -6.0 to 6.0, and each needs one decimal place.

First, I need to understand how the reward function works. It's +1 for every time step where the pole is upright (angle within -0.418 rad) and the cart is within [-2.4, 2.4]. If any of these conditions aren't met, the episode ends, and the total reward decreases.

The policy is linear with parameters W and B, which form a matrix of size 2x5 (since state has 4 elements: [cart_pos, cart_vel, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity] and action has 2). The current parameters are part of this setup, so I can adjust them to see how the reward changes.

Looking at the examples provided, some parameter sets give a reward around 300-450. But the user mentioned that the global optimum is expected around 500, so my current approach might be missing something or requires more tuning.

I'll start by adjusting the parameters to see how they affect the reward. Since I'm exploring both positive and negative values during exploration, I should try different combinations, especially focusing on increasing the pole angle (since that's part of the state) and ensuring the cart is within bounds.

Maybe starting with some higher values for W[0][2] and W[1][3], which affect the pole angle and angular velocity. Also, increasing B to allow for more flexibility in action selection might help.

I should also watch out for when parameters like params[8] (B) become too large or negative, as they could either push the cart beyond bounds or make the pole unstable.

After several iterations of tweaking these parameters based on the reward feedback from each episode, I hope to converge towards a set that maximizes f(params). It might require multiple trials and adjustments, but this systematic exploration should lead me closer to the optimal solution.
