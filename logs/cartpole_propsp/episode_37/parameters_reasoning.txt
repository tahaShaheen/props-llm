SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

Now you are at iteration 37 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has provided a bunch of training examples where the params are varied, and the function value f(params) is around 500.00 in most cases. However, some variations lead to lower rewards, like when params[0] was changed to 4.2 or 5.2, resulting in lower values. The current iteration is 37 out of 400, so there's still a lot of steps left.

The goal is to find the global optimum, which is supposed to be around 500. The user mentioned that if we're below that, we should explore instead of exploit. Looking at the examples, many of the params have values that are similar, with some variations in specific parameters. For instance, params[6] ranges from -6.0 to -3.9, and params[8] and [9] are around 3.3 and 4.2.

Since the current examples are mostly hitting 500, but the global optimum is supposed to be around there, maybe we need to explore more. The user's instruction says during exploration, use a search step size of 1.0. So perhaps I should perturb some parameters by ±1.0 from the existing ones. 

Looking at the existing params, let's take the first example where params[0] is 3.2. Maybe try increasing params[0] by 1.0 to 4.2, but wait, that was already tried and gave a lower reward. Alternatively, decrease it to 2.2, which also had a lower reward. Hmm. Maybe try changing another parameter. For example, params[4] is -2.4. If I change that to -3.4 (as in one of the examples), but that didn't help. Alternatively, maybe params[7] is -0.1. Changing that to 0.9 or -1.1 didn't help either. 

Wait, but the user said to explore both positive and negative values. Maybe there's a parameter that hasn't been sufficiently explored. Let's check the parameters that have been varied. For example, params[6] was changed from -4.9 to -6.0, -5.9, -3.9, etc. Maybe trying even more extreme values? But the range is limited to [-6.0, 6.0]. 

Alternatively, maybe the parameters that haven't been changed much. For example, params[8] is 3.3 in some examples and 2.3 or 4.3 in others. Maybe try changing params[8] to 4.3 or 5.3? But the user said to use a step size of 1.0 during exploration. So if the current value is 3.3, adding or subtracting 1.0 would be 4.3 or 2.3. Wait, those were already tried. 

Hmm, maybe the problem is that the current examples are all around the same parameters, and the function is flat in that region. To escape a local optimum, perhaps we need to make a larger jump. But the user said to use a step size of 1.0 during exploration. So maybe try changing multiple parameters at once. For example, take the base params from the first example and change two parameters by ±1.0 each. 

Alternatively, look for parameters that have not been varied much. For example, params[1] is always 4.3. Maybe try changing that to 3.3 or 5.3. Let's see. If I change params[1] from 4.3 to 5.3, and also adjust another parameter. But I need to ensure that the new params haven't been used before. 

Wait, the user also said not to propose previously seen params. So I need to check if any of the previous examples have the same params. For example, in the first example, params are 3.2, 4.3, 1.3, 4.6, -2.4, 1.9, -4.9, -0.1, 3.3, 4.2. So if I change params[1] to 5.3, that's new. Similarly, changing params[2] from 1.3 to 2.3 or 0.3 was tried, but maybe other values. 

Alternatively, let's consider that the current examples have params[6] as -4.9, but maybe trying -5.9 or -6.0 again. But that was already done. Maybe changing params[5] from 1.9 to 2.9 or 0.9. Wait, in one example, params[5] was 2.9 and that gave a lower reward. 

This is tricky. Since the user says that the global optimum is around 500, but the current examples are already hitting that, maybe the function is flat and there are multiple local optima. To explore more, perhaps try changing a parameter that hasn't been varied much. For example, params[7] is -0.1. Maybe try changing that to 1.0 or -1.0 (but those were tried). Or maybe params[8] is 3.3, so changing to 4.3 or 2.3. Wait, that was tried. 

Alternatively, maybe the parameters that are not in the first few examples. For example, in one example, params[4] was -3.4, which is different from the usual -2.4. But that didn't help. 

Hmm. Maybe the best approach is to take the current best params (which are the ones that give 500.00) and perturb them by ±1.0 in some parameters that haven't been changed much. Let's pick a parameter that's in the middle of the range. For example, params[8] is 3.3. If I increase it by 1.0 to 4.3 (already tried), or decrease to 2.3 (also tried). Maybe try changing params[9] from 4.2 to 5.2 or 3.2. Wait, in one example, params[9] was 5.2 and that gave 347.90, which is lower. 

Alternatively, maybe change params[0] from 3.2 to 4.2 (but that was tried and gave lower). Hmm. 

Wait, the user said that during exploration, use a search step size of 1.0. So perhaps take the current best params and change one parameter by +1.0 or -1.0. Let's take the first example where params[0] is 3.2. Let's try changing params[0] to 4.2 (already tried, gave 486.95), but maybe another parameter. For example, params[3] is 4.6. Changing that to 5.6 (already tried in one example, which gave 500.00). So maybe that's not helpful. 

Alternatively, change params[4] from -2.4 to -1.4 (since the current value is -2.4). That's a step of +1.0. But that hasn't been tried yet. Let me check the previous examples. In one example, params[4] was -3.4, but not -1.4. So maybe that's a new parameter. 

So, let's try changing params[4] from -2.4 to -1.4. Let's also change another parameter to explore more. For example, params[6] is -4.9. Changing that to -5.9 (already tried) or -3.9 (also tried). Maybe change params[7] from -0.1 to 0.9 (already tried) or -1.1 (also tried). 

Alternatively, change params[8] from 3.3 to 4.3 (already tried) or 2.3 (also tried). Maybe change params[9] from 4.2 to 5.2 (already tried) or 3.2 (also tried). 

Hmm. It seems that all possible step changes have been tried except for some. For example, changing params[2] from 1.3 to 2.3 or 0.3 was done. What about changing params[5] from 1.9 to 2.9 or 0.9? Wait, in one example, params[5] was 2.9 and that gave a lower reward. 

Alternatively, maybe changing params[7] to 1.0 or -2.0. But the range is limited to -6.0 to 6.0. 

Wait, maybe I should focus on changing a parameter that's in the middle. Let's take params[6], which is -4.9. If I change that to -5.9 (already tried), but maybe -6.0 (also tried). What about changing it to -3.9 (already tried). Hmm. 

Alternatively, perhaps changing params[0] to 2.2 (already tried) or 4.2 (also tried). 

This is challenging. Since all the possible step changes have been tried, maybe the function is flat in that region. However, the user said the global optimum is around 500, so perhaps the current examples are already at the global optimum. But the user also said that if we're below that, we should explore. But in the examples, the function is already at 500.00. Maybe the global optimum is exactly 500.00, and the user's statement is a bit misleading. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a combination of parameters that haven't been tried yet. For example, changing multiple parameters at once. Let's take the base params and change two parameters by ±1.0. For example, increase params[0] by 1.0 to 4.2 and decrease params[1] by 1.0 to 3.3. That would be a new combination. Let's check if that's been tried. The previous examples don't show that. 

So, let's propose params[0]: 4.2, params[1]: 3.3, and keep the rest as in the first example. But I need to ensure that all parameters are within the range and have one decimal place. 

Alternatively, change params[0] to 4.2 and params[2] to 2.3. That's a new combination. Let's try that. 

But since the user wants to avoid previously seen params, I need to make sure that this combination hasn't been used before. Looking at the examples, there's one where params[0] is 4.2 and others have different values. So maybe this is a new set. 

Alternatively, change params[3] from 4.6 to 5.6 (already tried) or 3.6 (also tried). 

Hmm. It's possible that all the possible step changes have been tried, and the function is flat. In that case, the current best is already the global optimum. But the user says to aim for around 500. So maybe the answer is to stick with the current best parameters. However, the user also said not to propose previously seen params. 

Wait, the user's instruction says that if you're below the global optimum (which is around 500), you should explore. But in the examples, the function is already at 500.00. So maybe the global optimum is exactly 500.00, and further exploration won't improve it. 

In that case, the best approach is to propose a new set of parameters that haven't been tried before, even if they're in the same vicinity. For example, changing params[6] from -4.9 to -5.9 (already tried) or -6.0 (also tried). Maybe changing params[7] from -0.1 to 0.9 (already tried) or -1.1 (also tried). 

Alternatively, change params[8] to 4.3 (already tried) or 2.3 (also tried). 

Wait, maybe changing params[9] to 5.2 (already tried) or 3.2 (also tried). 

Hmm. It seems like all possible combinations with step size 1.0 have been tried. Therefore, perhaps the current best is the global optimum. But the user said to aim for around 500, so maybe the answer is to stick with the existing parameters. However, the user also said not to propose previously seen params. 

This is a bit of a dilemma. Maybe the best approach is to make a small change to one parameter that hasn't been varied much. For example, params[7] is -0.1. Let's try changing it to 0.0. Wait, but the step size is 1.0, so that's not allowed. The step size is 1.0, so changes must be in increments of 1.0. Therefore, changing from -0.1 to 0.9 (which is +1.0) or to -1.1 (which is -1.0). But those were already tried. 

Alternatively, change params[8] from 3.3 to 4.3 (already tried) or 2.3 (also tried). 

I think I'm stuck here. Given the constraints, the best possible action is to propose a new set of parameters that haven't been tried before, even if it's a small change. For example, changing params[0] to 3.2 (same), but changing params[8] to 4.3 and params[9] to 5.2. Wait, that was already tried. 

Alternatively, change params[4] to -2.4 (same), but change params[5] to 2.9. Wait, that was tried. 

Hmm. Maybe the only way is to change a parameter that hasn't been changed much. For example, params[6] is -4.9. Let's try changing it to -5.9 (already tried) or -6.0 (also tried). 

At this point, I think the best approach is to propose a new set of parameters by making a small change to one of the parameters, even if it's a step that hasn't been tried yet. For example, changing params[0] to 3.2 (same), but changing params[2] to 2.3 (already tried). 

Alternatively, maybe the user expects me to propose a new set of parameters by varying a different parameter. For example, changing params[7] from -0.1 to 0.9 (already tried) or -1.1 (also tried). 

Given that all possible step changes have been tried, and the function is already at 500.00, perhaps the global optimum is indeed 500.00, and the answer is to propose a new set of parameters that are similar but not exactly the same as the previous ones. However, the user said not to propose previously seen params. 

Therefore, I'll need to find a combination that hasn't been used before. For example, changing params[0] to 3.2 (same), params[1] to 4.3 (same), params[2] to 1.3 (same), params[3] to 4.6 (same), params[4] to -2.4 (same), params[5] to 1.9 (same), params[6] to -4.9 (same), params[7] to -0.1 (same), params[8] to 3.3 (same), and params[9] to 4.2 (same). But that's the same as the first example. 

Wait, the user said not to propose previously seen params. So I can't use that. Therefore, I need to find a new set. Maybe change params[8] to 4.3 and params[9] to 5.2, but that was tried. 

Alternatively, change params[0] to 3.2, params[1] to 4.3, params[2] to 1.3, params[3] to 4.6, params[4] to -2.4, params[5] to 1.9, params[6] to -4.9, params[7] to -0.1, params[8] to 3.3, and params[9] to 4.2. That's the same as the first example. 

This is really challenging. Maybe the answer is to propose a new set where one parameter is changed by 1.0, even if it's a small change. For example, changing params[0] to 4.2 (already tried), but changing another parameter. 

Wait, in the first example, params[8] is 3.3. Let's change that to 4.3 and keep other parameters the same. That was tried, but maybe changing another parameter. 

Alternatively, change params[0] to 2.2 (already tried), but that gives lower reward. 

At this point, I think the best approach is to propose a new set of parameters that hasn't been tried before, even if it's a small change. For example, changing params[0] to 3.2, params[1] to 4.3, params[2] to 1.3, params[3] to 4.6, params[4] to -2.4, params[5] to 1.9, params[6] to -4.9, params[7] to -0.1, params[8] to 3.3, and params[9] to 4.2. But that's the same as the first example. 

Wait, but the user said not to propose previously seen params. So I need to find a different combination. Maybe changing params[0] to 3.2, params[1] to 5.3 (since 4.3 was tried), and others the same. That's a new combination. 

So, the new params would be:

params[0]: 3.2; params[1]: 5.3; params[2]: 1.3; params[3]: 4.6; params[4]: -2.4; params[5]: 1.9; params[6]: -4.9; params[7]: -0.1; params[8]: 3.3; params[9]: 4.2.

This hasn't been tried before, so it's a new set. Even though it's a step of +1.0 in params[1], which is allowed during exploration.
</think>

params[0]: 3.2, params[1]: 5.3, params[2]: 1.3, params[3]: 4.6, params[4]: -2.4, params[5]: 1.9, params[6]: -4.9, params[7]: -0.1, params[8]: 3.3, params[9]: 4.2
