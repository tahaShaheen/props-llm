SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.
params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5; f(params): 500.00
params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 4.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5; f(params): 499.35
params[0]: 6; params[1]: 1.3; params[2]: -6; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 6; params[9]: 6; f(params): 497.35
params[0]: 5; params[1]: 1.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 5; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -5; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 6; params[9]: 6; f(params): 497.15
params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 6; params[9]: 6; f(params): 494.80
params[0]: 6; params[1]: 3.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5; f(params): 366.10
params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 5; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5; f(params): 476.60
params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 5; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5; f(params): 478.75


Now you are at iteration 198 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user provided some examples of params and their corresponding episodic rewards. The goal is to find the global optimal policy with a maximum reward around 500. From the examples, the highest reward so far is 500.00, which is from the first set of params. But the user mentioned that if we're below 500, we should explore instead of exploit. 

Looking at the current iteration, it's 198 out of 400. Since we're still early in the iterations, maybe we need to explore more. The previous examples show that changing certain parameters like params[1], params[2], params[7], and params[8] can affect the reward. For instance, when params[1] was 2.3, the reward was higher compared to when it was 1.3 or 3.3. Also, params[2] was -5 in the highest reward example, and params[7] was 6. 

But the user said to use a search step size of 1.0 during exploration. So maybe we should perturb some parameters by +/-1.0 from the current best. Let's look at the first example with reward 500.00. The params are [6, 2.3, -5, 6, 5.3, 6, -6, 6, 5, 5]. To explore, we can change some parameters. For example, increasing params[1] to 3.3 (but that gave a lower reward in one example), or decreasing it to 1.3. However, since the user says to explore both positive and negative values, maybe trying other combinations. 

Wait, but the current best is 500.00. The user says the global optimum should be around 500, so maybe we need to check if there's a way to get higher. However, the examples show that some variations around the best params give slightly lower rewards. But perhaps there are other parameters that can be adjusted. For example, looking at params[7], which is 6 in the best case. What if we lower it to 5? In one example, when params[7] was 5, the reward was 476.60, which is lower. But maybe increasing it further? But the max is 6.0. 

Alternatively, looking at params[8] and params[9], which are 5 and 5 in the best case. Maybe increasing them to 6. In one example, when params[8] and [9] were 6, the reward was 497.35, which is lower. Hmm. Maybe other parameters. 

Looking at params[6], which is -6 in the best case. What if we change that to -5? But that might not be helpful. Alternatively, maybe adjusting params[4] or [5]. In the best case, params[4] is 5.3 and [5] is 6. Maybe increasing [4] to 6.3? But the range is up to 6.0. So can't. 

Alternatively, maybe changing params[0], which is 6.0. Since the max is 6.0, can't increase. What about decreasing it to 5.0? But that might lower the reward. 

Alternatively, looking at params[2], which is -5. Maybe changing it to -6. In one example, when params[2] was -6, the reward was 497.35, which is lower. So that might not help. 

Hmm. Maybe the current best is already near the optimal. But the user says to explore if below 500. Since the current best is exactly 500, maybe we should try to explore nearby points. For example, changing one parameter by +/-1.0. Let's pick a parameter that's not at the extreme. For example, params[1] is 2.3. Adding 1.0 gives 3.3, but that was tried and gave lower reward. Subtracting 1.0 gives 1.3, which was also tried. Maybe other parameters. 

Looking at params[8] and [9], which are 5.0. Increasing them to 6.0. But that was tried and gave lower reward. What about params[7], which is 6.0. Can't increase further. Maybe decrease to 5.0. But that was tried. 

Alternatively, maybe adjusting params[4], which is 5.3. Increasing to 6.3 is not possible. Maybe decreasing to 4.3. But in one example, that was tried and gave 499.35. Close to 500. 

Alternatively, maybe adjusting params[3], which is 6.0. Can't increase. Maybe decrease to 5.0. But that might lower the reward. 

Alternatively, looking at params[6] which is -6.0. Maybe increasing to -5.0. Let's try that. So changing params[6] from -6 to -5. Let's see what that would do. 

So, the original best params are:
params[0]:6, [1]:2.3, [2]:-5, [3]:6, [4]:5.3, [5]:6, [6]:-6, [7]:6, [8]:5, [9]:5.

Changing [6] to -5. So new params would be:
params[0]:6, [1]:2.3, [2]:-5, [3]:6, [4]:5.3, [5]:6, [6]:-5, [7]:6, [8]:5, [9]:5.

This is a new set of params not seen before. Let's propose this. Alternatively, maybe changing params[8] or [9] from 5 to 6. But that was tried. 

Alternatively, changing params[2] from -5 to -6. But that was tried and gave lower reward. 

Alternatively, changing params[7] from 6 to 5. But that was tried. 

Hmm. Maybe changing params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3 is not possible. But if we can't, perhaps changing another parameter. 

Alternatively, looking at params[0] which is 6.0. Maybe changing it to 5.0. But that might lower the reward. 

Alternatively, trying to adjust params[1] to 3.3, but that was tried. 

Alternatively, trying to change params[5] from 6 to 5. But that might not help. 

Alternatively, looking at params[8] and [9], maybe changing them to 6.0. But that was tried. 

Wait, in one of the examples, when params[8] and [9] were 6, the reward was 497.35. So lower than 500. So maybe not helpful. 

Alternatively, maybe changing params[2] from -5 to -4. But that's not within the step size of 1.0. Wait, the step size is 1.0, so from -5, adding or subtracting 1.0 would be -6 or -4. But -4 is allowed. However, the previous example with params[2] as -6 gave lower reward. So maybe trying -4. But that's a new parameter. 

So, changing params[2] from -5 to -4. Let's try that. New params would be:
params[0]:6, [1]:2.3, [2]:-4, [3]:6, [4]:5.3, [5]:6, [6]:-6, [7]:6, [8]:5, [9]:5.

But I need to check if this is a new set. Since in the examples, params[2] was -5, -6, but not -4. So this is new. 

Alternatively, changing params[7] from 6 to 5 (already tried) or 7 (but max is 6). 

Alternatively, changing params[3] from 6 to 5. Let's try that. New params:
params[0]:6, [1]:2.3, [2]:-5, [3]:5, [4]:5.3, [5]:6, [6]:-6, [7]:6, [8]:5, [9]:5.

This is a new set. 

Alternatively, changing params[4] from 5.3 to 4.3 (as in one example, which gave 499.35). But that's a step of -1.0. 

Hmm. Maybe trying to change params[6] to -5.0. Let's go with that. So the new params would be as I mentioned earlier. 

But the user says to explore both positive and negative values. So maybe trying multiple changes. However, since the user wants a single set of params, I need to pick one. 

Alternatively, perhaps changing params[8] and [9] from 5 to 6. But that was tried. 

Alternatively, changing params[7] to 5.0. Let me check if that's been tried. In one example, params[7] was 5.0 and the reward was 476.60. So that's lower. 

Alternatively, changing params[1] to 3.3 (but that was tried with lower reward). 

Hmm. Maybe the best approach is to slightly perturb one parameter from the current best. Let's pick params[8] and [9] from 5 to 6. But that was tried. 

Alternatively, changing params[7] from 6 to 5. But that was tried. 

Alternatively, changing params[6] from -6 to -5. Let's proceed with that. So the new params are:

params[0]:6.0, params[1]:2.3, params[2]:-5.0, params[3]:6.0, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:6.0, params[6]:-5.0, params[7]:6.0, params[8]:5.0, params[9]:5.0.

This is a new set not seen before. Let's propose this.
