SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 178 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to optimize the parameters for a linear policy in the CartPole environment. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward, which they mentioned should be around 500. The current iteration is 178 out of 400, so there's still room for exploration.

Looking at the examples provided, the top-performing params have some patterns. For instance, params[0], [3], [5], [7] are often 6, while params[2], [6] are -5 or -6. The biases (params[8], [9]) are mostly around 5 or 6. The highest reward so far is 500.00 with params like [6, 2.3, -5, 6, 5.3, 6, -6, 6, 5, 5]. But the user says that if we're below 500, we should explore instead of exploit.

Since the current iteration is 178, maybe we should explore more. The user mentioned using a search step size of 1.0 during exploration. So, perhaps adjusting some parameters by +/- 1.0 from the current values. Let's check the existing params. For example, in the first example, params[1] is 2.3. If we increase that by 1.0 to 3.3, maybe that could lead to a better reward. Similarly, params[4] is 5.3; increasing that to 6.3 might help. However, parameters can't exceed 6.0, so we need to stay within the range.

Wait, the parameters are in the range [-6.0, 6.0] with one decimal place. So, the maximum is 6.0. So, if a parameter is already at 6.0, we can't increase it further. Let's look at the existing params. For example, params[0] is 6.0 in several examples, so we can't increase that. Maybe we can decrease some parameters that are high. For instance, params[1] in some cases is 2.3, which could be adjusted to 1.3 or 3.3. But since the user wants exploration, perhaps trying different values even if they are not in the top examples.

Another approach is to look for parameters that haven't been explored much. For example, in the existing examples, params[2] is often -5 or -6. What if we try a less negative value, like -4? Or maybe even positive? But that might not be optimal. Alternatively, looking at params[4], which is 5.3 in some cases. Trying 6.0 (if not already done) or 4.3. But since the user says to explore with step size 1.0, maybe changing some parameters by +/-1.0 from the current best.

Wait, the first example with 500.00 has params[1] as 2.3. If we increase that by 1.0 to 3.3, but in one of the examples, that's already tried (params[0]: 6; params[1]: 3.3; ... f(params): 372.50), which is lower. So that might not be good. Maybe decreasing params[1] from 2.3 to 1.3? But that's already in the examples with lower rewards. Hmm.

Alternatively, looking at other parameters. For instance, params[8] and [9] (the biases) are mostly 5 or 6. Maybe trying 6.0 for both. Wait, in the first example, they are 5 and 5. In other examples, they are 6 and 6. Maybe trying different combinations here.

Another thought: the current best is 500.00, but the user says the global optimum is around 500. So maybe we need to explore nearby regions. For example, changing one parameter slightly. Let's take the first example's params and tweak one. For instance, params[2] is -5. If we change that to -4 (but that was tried in one example with lower reward). Or maybe params[6] is -6; changing that to -5.5 (but that was tried as well). 

Wait, the user said to not propose previously seen params. So I need to make sure that the new params are not in the examples given. Let me check the existing examples again. The first example has params[0] to [9] as 6,2.3,-5,6,5.3,6,-6,6,5,5. Other examples have variations. So, to avoid repetition, perhaps changing a parameter that hasn't been altered much. For example, params[4] is 5.3 in some cases. Maybe changing that to 6.0 (but in one example, params[4] is 6.0 and the reward was 428.55, which is lower). Alternatively, changing params[5] from 6 to 5.3? Not sure.

Alternatively, looking at params[7], which is 6 in most examples. What if we lower that to 5? Or maybe increase it? But it's already at max. Maybe changing params[2] from -5 to -6 (but that's already in some examples). Hmm.

Wait, the user mentioned that during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So, perhaps taking one of the existing parameters and changing it by +/-1.0. For example, in the first example, params[1] is 2.3. Adding 1.0 would make it 3.3, but that was tried and gave lower reward. Subtracting 1.0 would make it 1.3, which is already in the examples. So maybe that's not helpful. 

Looking at params[4] (5.3). Adding 1.0 would make it 6.3, but that's beyond the maximum of 6.0. So can't do that. Subtracting 1.0 would make it 4.3, which was tried in one example with lower reward. 

What about params[8] and [9], which are 5 and 5 in the first example. Changing them to 6 and 6 (as in other examples) might not help, but maybe trying 5.5 and 5.5? Not sure. 

Alternatively, looking at params[6] which is -6. Adding 1.0 would make it -5.0. That was tried in some examples. 

Hmm, maybe trying to change a parameter that's not in the top examples. For example, in the first example, params[2] is -5. What if we set that to -5.5? But that was tried in one example with lower reward. 

Alternatively, looking at params[3] which is 6 in most examples. Changing that to 5.0? Not sure. 

This is tricky. Since the user wants exploration with step size 1.0, perhaps changing one parameter by +/-1.0 from the current best. Let's take the first example's params and change one parameter. For instance, params[8] is 5.0. Increasing that by 1.0 to 6.0. So the new params would be: params[0]:6, params[1]:2.3, params[2]:-5, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:6, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:6, params[9]:5. But wait, in the first example, params[8] is 5 and params[9] is 5. If we change params[8] to 6, and keep params[9] at 5, maybe that's a new combination. But I need to check if this has been tried before. Looking at the examples, there's one with params[8]:6 and params[9]:6. But this would be 6 and 5, which hasn't been seen yet. So that's a new param set. Let's try that.

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 6; params[9]: 5
