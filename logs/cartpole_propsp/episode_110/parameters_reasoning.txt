SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 110 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to get a higher reward in this cartpole environment using policy gradient methods. The user mentioned that the global optimum is around 500, but they're at iteration 110 with a reward of about 169.7. So, there's still room for improvement.

First, I need to understand how the parameters affect the reward. From what I remember, in policy gradient methods like PPO or A2C, we estimate the value function based on the current policy and use that to guide our action updates. The state space here is four-dimensional: cart position, velocity, pole angle, and angular velocity.

Looking at the provided parameters, each action (left or right) is determined by a linear equation of the form action = argmax(state @ W + B). So, W is a 4x18 matrix where each row corresponds to an action. The first four columns are for the state variables, and the last column is B.

The reward function adds +1 every time step the pole stays upright within certain bounds. There are also penalties for going out of bounds on the cart or making the pole fall over.

To improve the reward, I should adjust the parameters in a way that encourages staying upright and keeping the cart stable. Maybe adding more force to push right when pole is balanced could help the cart stay within bounds, but too much force might make it actuate excessively, causing the pole to flip.

Looking at the best performing params mentioned earlier:

- params[0]: -6; params[1]: 2.5; ... and so on. This setup seems like it's trying different combinations with higher left forces and right force a bit lower but still pushing the cart out of bounds.

But these have low rewards, maybe because they're not pushing enough to keep the pole upright when possible.

Another set:

- params[0]: -5; ... and that also gives a low reward. Hmm.

Wait, there are some that have higher left forces, which might make the cart push too far right, causing it to go out of bounds. That's bad because then the episode ends. So I need parameters where pushing right isn't too aggressive when the pole is upright.

Also, keeping the pole upright requires more effort than just letting it swing. Maybe increasing some action variables would help when the pole is balanced.

I should look for a balance in W and B such that when the pole is upright, the actions are to push left as much as possible without overstepping on right.

Maybe setting params[3] (right force) higher but not too high so it doesn't get out of bounds. Or perhaps increasing params[0] (left force) a bit more while keeping right lower might help.

Another approach is to ensure that when the pole is upright, the policy gives enough action towards left to stay within limits, and any remaining left action helps keep the pole upright.

I think I need to experiment with different combinations where pushing right isn't too strong but still pushes the cart out of bounds. Maybe a slight increase in right force would help balance things without causing an episode end.

Also, ensuring that when the pole is balanced, the policy doesn't always choose to push left more than necessary because that might cause it to go beyond the -2.4 boundary.

Perhaps starting with params[3] slightly higher and others adjusted accordingly could yield better rewards.

I should try parameters where pushing right isn't too aggressive but still gives a chance to balance the pole without losing stability.
