SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 114 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to optimize the parameters for a linear policy in the CartPole environment. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward, which they mentioned should be around 500. The current examples show that the best so far is 497.35, which is close but not quite there.

Looking at the top params, the first one has params[0] to [9] with several values at 6 and -6. The reward is 497.35. The next few examples have similar structures but slightly lower rewards. The user's instruction says that if the current value is below 500, we should explore instead of exploit, using a search step size of 1.0.

So, the idea is to explore the parameter space by making changes of 1.0 to the parameters that are currently at the extremes (like -6 or 6). For example, if a parameter is at 6, maybe try 5 or 7 (but 7 is outside the allowed range, so only 5). Similarly for -6, try -5.

Looking at the current top params, many of the parameters are at 6 or -6. Let's pick one of those and adjust them. For instance, in the first example, params[2] is -6. Maybe increasing it to -5 could help. Also, params[4] is 5.3, which is not at the extreme. But maybe adjusting some of the other parameters that are at 6 or -6.

Another thing to note is that the bias terms (params[8] and [9]) are at 6 in the top example. Maybe adjusting those could help. For example, lowering them to 5 or increasing to 7 (but 7 is not allowed). So, 5.

So, a possible move would be to take the first example (params with 497.35) and adjust some of the parameters that are at 6 or -6. For example, change params[2] from -6 to -5, and maybe params[6] from -6 to -5. Also, maybe adjust params[8] and [9] from 6 to 5. Let's try that.

So, the new params would be:

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 1.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -5; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5.

This changes three parameters from -6 to -5, and two from 6 to 5. This should be a step in the exploration phase, moving away from the extremes to see if that leads to a higher reward. Alternatively, maybe changing some other parameters. But the key is to make changes of 1.0 to the extreme values.
