SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 114 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.

<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to find the global optimal policy for this cartpole environment. The user mentioned that the current approach with a linear policy might not be finding the best solution. They want me to propose parameters within specific ranges and then test them to see if I can get a higher reward.

First, I look at the parameter values given in the top 7 performing params. These seem to have some interesting combinations where some W elements are positive or negative. For example, params[0] is -5, which is quite low, but others like [2], [3], etc., have mixed signs and higher magnitudes. The reward of around 195 suggests that the current parameters might not be optimal.

I think I should try to find better parameter values by exploring different ranges for each parameter. Since all params are between -6.0 and 6.0, but with some in between, perhaps I can increase some W elements more than others or adjust signs strategically.

Maybe if I increase certain params like [2] and [3], which influence the pole angle and velocity, that could help balance the pole better without causing too much movement of the cart. Also, making [6] (pole angle) a bit higher might prevent it from falling over more easily.

On the other hand, increasing [4] (cart velocity) might stabilize the pole but I need to check if it causes more movement in the cart, which could lead to higher energy costs or worse reward. It's all about finding a sweet spot where the rewards are maximized without causing too much negative outcomes.

I decide to focus on parameters like [2], [3], [6] and maybe adjust others for balance. I propose new values based on some experimentation, aiming to see if I can achieve higher than 195 reward while keeping the params within the specified ranges.
