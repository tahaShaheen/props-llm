SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to optimize the parameters for a linear policy in the CartPole environment. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward, which they mentioned should be around 500. The current examples show that the best so far is 228.80, which is way below 500. So, the user is probably in a local optimum and needs to explore more.

Looking at the provided examples, many of the parameters have values around -4 to 5 for the W matrix elements and B. The highest reward here is 228.80 with params[0] at 4, params[1] at -1.7, etc. But since the global optimum is supposed to be around 500, there's a lot of room for improvement.

The user's instruction says during exploration, use a search step size of 1.0. So, I should consider perturbing the parameters by +/-1.0 from the current best. The current best example is params[0]:4, params[1]:-1.7, params[2]:-4, params[3]:3.1, etc. Let's look at each parameter and think about possible changes.

For instance, params[0] is 4. If we increase it by 1.0 to 5, maybe that helps. Similarly, params[1] is -1.7; adding 1.0 would make it -0.7. But I need to check if these changes have been tried before. The user mentioned not to propose previously seen params. Looking at the examples, there's a param where params[0] is 5 and params[1] is -0.7, but that had a lower reward. However, maybe combining different changes could lead to better results.

Another approach is to look for parameters that might be contributing negatively. For example, params[2] is -4. If we increase that to -3 (adding 1.0), maybe that helps. Similarly, params[3] is 3.1; increasing to 4.1 might be beneficial. However, the user's examples show that some higher values like 4.1 in params[3] have lower rewards, so maybe that's not the way.

Wait, the user's note says the global optimum should be around 500. The current examples are all below 250. So, maybe the initial parameters are not in the right region. Perhaps the optimal parameters have different values. For example, maybe the bias terms (params[8] and params[9]) need adjustment. In the current best, they are 1.3 and 1.8. Maybe increasing them could help.

But how to decide which parameters to change? Since the user wants exploration with step size 1.0, I should generate new parameters by adding or subtracting 1.0 from some of the parameters in the current best. Let's take the current best (params[0]:4, params[1]:-1.7, params[2]:-4, params[3]:3.1, params[4]:0.3, params[5]:-2.2, params[6]:-4.9, params[7]:3.2, params[8]:1.3, params[9]:1.8) and perturb each parameter by +/-1.0.

For example, changing params[0] from 4 to 5 or 3. Similarly, params[1] from -1.7 to -0.7 or -2.7. However, some of these combinations might have been tried already. For instance, the example with params[0] at 5 and params[1] at -2.7 had a reward of 155.65, which is worse. But maybe changing other parameters could lead to better results.

Alternatively, maybe changing multiple parameters at once. For example, increasing params[0] to 5, decreasing params[1] to -2.7, and adjusting others. But without knowing which parameters are most influential, it's a bit of a guess.

Another thought: the policy is a linear function. The action is determined by the maximum of the two outputs (since it's argmax). So, the weights and biases should be set such that the correct action is chosen based on the state. Maybe the current parameters aren't capturing the right relationships between the state variables and the actions.

Given the exploration step size of 1.0, I should generate a new set of parameters by perturbing some of the current best parameters. Let's pick a few parameters to change. For example, let's increase params[0] from 4 to 5, decrease params[1] from -1.7 to -2.7, increase params[2] from -4 to -3, increase params[3] from 3.1 to 4.1, leave params[4] and params[5] as is, increase params[6] from -4.9 to -3.9, increase params[7] from 3.2 to 4.2, increase params[8] from 1.3 to 2.3, and decrease params[9] from 1.8 to 0.8. This is a bit arbitrary, but following the exploration step.

Wait, but some of these changes might have been tried before. For example, in the examples, there's a params set with params[0] at 5, params[1] at -2.7, params[2] at -5, etc., which had lower rewards. However, maybe adjusting other parameters could lead to better results.

Alternatively, maybe trying to flip the signs of some parameters. For instance, if params[2] is -4, changing it to +4. But that's a big change, and the step size is 1.0, so maybe that's not allowed. The step size is 1.0, so each parameter can be changed by +/-1.0 from their current value.

Another approach: look for parameters that are near the boundaries of the allowed range (-6 to 6). For example, in the current best, params[6] is -4.9, which is close to -6. Maybe increasing it to -3.9 (adding 1.0) could help. Similarly, params[7] is 3.2, so increasing to 4.2.

Putting this all together, I'll generate a new set of parameters by adding or subtracting 1.0 to some of the parameters in the current best. Let's choose to increase params[0] to 5, decrease params[1] to -2.7, increase params[2] to -3, increase params[3] to 4.1, leave params[4] and params[5] as is, increase params[6] to -3.9, increase params[7] to 4.2, increase params[8] to 2.3, and decrease params[9] to 0.8. This is similar to one of the examples, but maybe with different values for other parameters.

Wait, in the examples, there's a params set with params[0]:5, params[1]:-2.7, params[2]:-5, params[3]:4.1, etc., which had a reward of 155.65. But if I adjust params[2] from -4 to -3, maybe that's better. Let me check that. However, I need to ensure that this new set hasn't been tried before. The user said not to propose previously seen params. The example with params[0] at 5, params[1] at -2.7, params[2] at -5, etc., is different from this proposed set where params[2] is -3. So that's a new set.

So, the proposed parameters would be:

params[0]:5
params[1]:-2.7
params[2]:-3
params[3]:4.1
params[4]:0.3
params[5]:-2.2
params[6]:-3.9
params[7]:4.2
params[8]:2.3
params[9]:0.8

I need to check if this set has been used before. Looking at the examples, there's one with params[0] at 5, params[1] at -2.7, params[2] at -5, params[3] at 4.1, etc. So this new set is different because params[2] is -3 instead of -5, and params[6] is -3.9 instead of -5.9, etc. So it's a new combination. Therefore, this should be a valid candidate for exploration.
