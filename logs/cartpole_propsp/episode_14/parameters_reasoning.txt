SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has given me a bunch of training examples for the cartpole environment with a linear policy. The goal is to find the optimal parameters that maximize the episodic reward. From the examples, I notice that several parameter sets have a reward of 500.00, which seems to be the maximum possible since the problem mentions the global optimum should be around 500.

Looking at the examples, the parameters that achieve 500.00 have certain patterns. For instance, params[0] is often 3.2, params[1] is 4.3, params[2] is around 1.3, params[3] is 4.6, params[4] is -2.4, params[5] is 1.9, params[6] is -4.9 or -5.9, params[7] is -0.1, params[8] is 3.3, and params[9] is 4.2 or 5.2. However, some variations in these parameters lead to lower rewards, like when params[0] is 4.2 or params[1] is 5.3.

Since the user mentioned that if the reward is below 500, we should explore instead of exploiting. But in the current examples, there are already multiple instances of 500.00. However, the user wants to continue exploring to ensure we're not stuck in a local optimum. The instruction says to use a search step size of 1.0 during exploration. So, maybe I should perturb some parameters by ±1.0 to see if there's a better combination.

Looking at the parameters that are consistent in the high-reward examples: params[6] is around -4.9 to -6.0. Maybe trying a value like -3.9 (which is +1.0 from -4.9) could help. Also, params[7] is mostly -0.1, but in one example it's 0.9. Perhaps adjusting that. Similarly, params[8] is 3.3, but in one case it's 4.3, which gave a lower reward. So maybe keeping it at 3.3 is better.

Alternatively, maybe changing other parameters like params[2] from 1.3 to 2.3 or 0.3. But those examples didn't show improvement. However, since the user wants exploration, perhaps trying to change params[6] from -4.9 to -5.9 (which is already in some examples) or even -6.9 (but that's outside the allowed range of -6.0). So the maximum negative is -6.0.

Another thought: the examples with params[6] at -6.0 and params[7] at -0.1 still gave 500.00. So maybe that's part of the optimal solution. However, to explore, maybe changing other parameters. For instance, params[4] is -2.4 in most cases. What if we change that to -1.4 (which was tried and resulted in lower reward) or -3.4 (also tried and lower). So perhaps keeping params[4] at -2.4 is better.

Looking at the bias terms, params[8] and params[9] are 3.3 and 4.2. In one example, params[9] was 5.2, which gave lower reward. So maybe keeping those values is better.

So, considering exploration, perhaps perturb params[6] to -3.9 (which is +1.0 from -4.9) and see. Also, check params[7] by adding 1.0 to -0.1, making it 0.9. But in one example, that was tried and still gave 500.00. So maybe that's okay.

Alternatively, maybe changing params[2] from 1.3 to 2.3 or 0.3, but those were tried and didn't improve. However, since the user wants exploration, maybe trying a different parameter.

Wait, the user said to use a search step size of 1.0 during exploration. So, for each parameter, we can add or subtract 1.0 from the current value. But the current values in the high-reward examples are already varying. For example, params[0] is 3.2. Adding 1.0 would make it 4.2, which was tried and gave lower reward. Subtracting 1.0 would make it 2.2, which was also tried (in one example with lower reward). So perhaps that's not helpful.

Alternatively, looking at params[5], which is 1.9. Adding 1.0 would make it 2.9, subtracting would make it 0.9. Maybe trying that. But I don't have data on that yet.

Alternatively, looking at params[3], which is 4.6. Adding 1.0 would be 5.6, subtracting would be 3.6. Maybe trying 5.6? But in one example, params[1] was 5.3 (which is +1.0 from 4.3) and that gave lower reward.

Hmm. This is tricky. Since the user wants exploration, perhaps changing one parameter that's in the current optimal set by ±1.0. For example, params[6] is -4.9. Adding 1.0 would make it -3.9. Let's try that. Also, maybe changing params[7] from -0.1 to 0.9 (which was tried and still gave 500.00). Or maybe changing params[8] from 3.3 to 4.3 (but that was tried and gave lower reward).

Alternatively, changing params[2] from 1.3 to 2.3 or 0.3. But in the examples, those didn't help. However, since we need to explore, maybe trying that again.

Wait, the user said not to propose previously seen params. So I need to make sure that the new parameters haven't been tried before. Looking at the examples, the ones with 500.00 have params[6] as -4.9, -5.9, -6.0, and -3.9 (in one example). So, maybe trying params[6] = -3.9 (which was in one example) but that's already been tried. So perhaps that's not allowed.

Alternatively, trying params[6] = -5.9 (already in an example). So perhaps another parameter. Let's check params[2]. In the examples, it's 1.3, 2.3, 0.3. So maybe trying 3.3? That hasn't been tried yet. Let's see.

So, modifying params[2] from 1.3 to 3.3. Let's try that. Also, maybe changing params[4] from -2.4 to -1.4 or -3.4. But those were tried and gave lower rewards. So perhaps not.

Alternatively, changing params[7] from -0.1 to -1.1 (as in one example) which gave 500.00. But that's already been tried. So maybe changing params[7] to 1.9 (adding 2.0). But that's outside the step size of 1.0. Wait, the step size is 1.0. So from -0.1, adding 1.0 would be 0.9, which was tried. Subtracting 1.0 would be -1.1, which was also tried. So those are already covered.

Hmm. Maybe changing params[8] from 3.3 to 4.3 (but that was tried and gave lower reward). Or to 2.3? Let's see. If params[8] is 2.3, which hasn't been tried in the examples. Maybe that's a new parameter set.

So, putting it all together, perhaps the next step is to try changing params[2] from 1.3 to 3.3, and keep other parameters as in the high-reward examples. That would be a new set of parameters not seen before. Let's check if that's allowed.

Yes, because in the examples, params[2] was 1.3, 2.3, 0.3. So 3.3 hasn't been tried yet. So that's a valid exploration step. Let's try that.
