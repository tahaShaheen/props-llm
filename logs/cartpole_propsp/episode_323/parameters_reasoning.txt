SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 323 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is working on optimizing a linear policy for the CartPole environment. They've provided a bunch of previous parameter sets and their corresponding rewards. The goal is to find the global optimum, which they mention should be around 500. The current iteration is 323 out of 400, so there's still some time left.

Looking at the examples, many of the top-performing params have values like params[0] at 6, params[1] at 2.3, params[2] at -5, params[3] at 6, and so on. The rewards for these are all around 500, which is the target. However, some variations, like changing params[2] to -4 or -6, result in lower rewards. Also, when params[8] is changed to 6 or 4, the reward drops. 

The user's instruction says that if we're below 500, we should explore instead of exploit. Since the current examples are already hitting 500, maybe we need to check if there's a way to tweak the parameters slightly to see if we can get even higher. But wait, the user mentioned that the global optimum is around 500, so maybe those examples are already close. However, the note says that if you're below 500, you should explore. Since the current examples are at 500, perhaps we should look for variations that might push it higher, but the user might be cautious about overfitting.

Wait, the user also said that during exploration, use a search step size of 1.0. So maybe we should make a small change to one of the parameters that are already at the edge of the range. For example, looking at params[2], which is -5 in most of the top examples. If we increase it to -4 (but that was tried and resulted in lower reward), or maybe decrease it to -6? Wait, in one of the examples, params[2] was -6 and the reward was 428.75, which is lower. So maybe that's not good.

Looking at params[4], which is around 5.3 in the top examples. If we increase it to 6, but in one example, when params[4] was 6, the reward was 413.65, which is lower. So that's worse. What about other parameters? Let's check params[6], which is -6 in many cases. If we change that to -5, but in one example, when params[6] was -5, the reward was 498.55, which is slightly lower than 500. So maybe keeping it at -6 is better.

Looking at the bias terms, params[8] and params[9] are both 5 in most of the top examples. Changing params[8] to 6 or 4 resulted in lower rewards, so maybe keeping them at 5 is better. 

Hmm. The current top examples are already hitting 500. The user says the global optimum is around 500, so maybe those are already optimal. But the user might want to check if there's a way to tweak parameters to get even higher. However, since the examples are already at 500, perhaps we need to explore other regions. 

Wait, the user mentioned that during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So maybe we can take one of the existing parameters and adjust one of them by 1.0. For example, take the first example where params[0] is 6, params[1] 2.3, params[2] -5, etc. Let's pick a parameter that's at the edge of the range. For instance, params[0] is already at 6.0, which is the maximum. Maybe we can decrease it by 1.0 to 5.0? But that might not be helpful. Alternatively, check other parameters. 

Looking at params[3], which is 6 in many cases. If we decrease that to 5, but in one example, when params[3] was 5, the reward was 500 as well. So that might not make a difference. 

Alternatively, check other parameters that are not at the extremes. For example, params[1] is 2.3. Maybe increase it by 1.0 to 3.3? But that's a big step. However, since the user said to use a step size of 1.0 during exploration, perhaps that's acceptable. 

Alternatively, check if any parameters are not at their extremes. For example, params[4] is 5.3. Maybe increasing that to 6.3? But the parameters are constrained to [-6.0, 6.0], so 6.3 is invalid. So the maximum is 6.0. 

Another approach: look for parameters that are in the middle. For example, params[8] and params[9] are 5.0. Maybe changing them to 6.0 or 4.0. But in previous examples, when params[8] was 6, the reward dropped. However, maybe trying other combinations. 

Alternatively, check if any parameters can be adjusted slightly. For example, params[4] is 5.3. Maybe changing that to 5.3 + 1.0 = 6.3 (invalid), or 5.3 - 1.0 = 4.3. But in one example, params[4] was 4.3, and the reward was 499.35, which is lower. So that's worse. 

Hmm. It seems that the existing parameters are already near the optimal. But the user wants to ensure that we're not stuck in a local optimum. Maybe trying to adjust one parameter that's not in the top examples. For example, in one of the examples, params[2] was -4, which gave lower reward. But maybe trying to adjust other parameters. 

Alternatively, check if there's a parameter that's not being used in the top examples. For example, looking at params[5], which is 6 in most cases. Maybe changing that to 5.0? But that might lower the reward. 

Alternatively, check if there's a parameter that's not in the examples. For example, in the first example, params[0] is 6, params[1] is 2.3. What if we change params[1] to 3.3 (adding 1.0)? Let's try that. So the new params would be: params[0]:6, params[1]:3.3, others same. But I don't know the effect. However, since the user says to explore, maybe that's a way to go. 

But the user also said not to propose previously seen params. So need to make sure that the new params haven't been tried before. Looking at the previous examples, params[1] is 2.3 in all of them. So changing it to 3.3 would be a new set. 

Alternatively, adjust params[2] from -5 to -6 (but that was tried and gave lower reward). Or adjust params[7] from 6 to 5. 

But the user says that during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So perhaps changing one parameter by 1.0. Let's pick a parameter that's in the middle of the range. For example, params[1] is 2.3. Maybe changing it to 3.3 (adding 1.0) or 1.3 (subtracting 1.0). 

Alternatively, check params[8] and params[9]. In the top examples, they are 5.0. Maybe changing one of them to 6.0 or 4.0. But in previous examples, when params[8] was 6, the reward was lower. However, perhaps trying other combinations. 

Alternatively, check if there's a parameter that's not in the top examples. For example, in one example, params[4] was 6, but that gave lower reward. So maybe that's not helpful. 

Hmm. This is tricky. Since the user is at iteration 323, and the maximum is 400, there's 77 iterations left. Maybe it's better to explore a bit more. Let's pick one parameter to adjust. For example, take the first example, which has params[0] at 6, params[1] at 2.3, params[2] at -5, etc. Let's try changing params[1] from 2.3 to 3.3 (adding 1.0). So the new params would be:

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 3.3, params[2]: -5, params[3]: 6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:6, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:5, params[9]:5.

This is a new set of parameters, not seen before. Let's propose this. Alternatively, maybe change params[2] from -5 to -6 (but that was tried and gave lower reward). Or change params[6] from -6 to -5. 

Alternatively, change params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3 (invalid), so can't do that. 

Alternatively, change params[4] from 5.3 to 4.3 (but that was tried and gave lower reward). 

Hmm. Maybe the best bet is to adjust a parameter that's not at the edge. For example, params[1] is 2.3. Adding 1.0 makes it 3.3. Let's go with that. So the new params would be as above.
