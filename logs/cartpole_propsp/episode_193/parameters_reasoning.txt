SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 193 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what to do next. The user provided some examples of parameters and their corresponding rewards. The goal is to find the optimal parameters that maximize the episodic reward, which they mentioned should be around 500. The current iteration is 193 out of 400, so there's still time to explore.

Looking at the examples, the highest reward so far is 500.00 with the parameters: [6, 2.3, -5, 6, 5.3, 6, -6, 6, 5, 5]. The next few have slightly lower rewards. The user's note says that if the current value is below 500, we should explore instead of exploit. Since the highest is already 500, maybe we need to check if there's a way to improve further or confirm that it's the maximum.

But wait, the user mentioned that the global optimum should be around 500. So maybe that's the maximum. However, the examples show that some parameters with similar values have slightly lower rewards. But the first example already hits 500.00. However, the user says that if we are below 500, we should explore. Since the current example is at 500, maybe we should check if there's a way to get higher than that, but perhaps that's already the maximum.

But the user also said that during exploration, we should use a step size of 1.0. So maybe we need to perturb the parameters slightly. However, the first example is already at 500.00. Let me check the parameters again. The first example has params[0] to [7] as 6, 2.3, -5, 6, 5.3, 6, -6, 6. Then B is 5 and 5. 

Wait, maybe there are other parameters that could lead to higher rewards. But according to the examples, the highest is 500.00. However, the user says that the global optimum should be around 500. So maybe that's the best possible. However, the user's note says that if we are below 500, we should explore. Since the first example is exactly at 500, perhaps that's the optimal. But maybe there's a way to tweak the parameters to get a higher reward. However, the user's instruction says that if we are below 500, we should explore. Since the current example is at 500, perhaps we should check if there's a better one by exploring nearby parameters.

But the user also says that during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So maybe we need to adjust some parameters by 1.0. For example, in the first example, params[1] is 2.3. If we increase it by 1.0 to 3.3, but in the examples, that gives a lower reward (380.65). Alternatively, maybe decreasing some parameters. However, the user says that during exploration, we should use a step size of 1.0. So perhaps we need to perturb each parameter by +/-1.0 from the current best parameters.

But since the current best is already at 500.00, perhaps that's the maximum. However, the user might want to confirm that there are no higher values. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to get higher than 500.00 by tweaking some parameters. But according to the examples, the highest is 500.00. So maybe that's the best possible. However, the user's note says that the global optimum should be around 500. So perhaps that's the correct answer. Therefore, the optimal parameters are the ones that give 500.00, which is the first example provided.
