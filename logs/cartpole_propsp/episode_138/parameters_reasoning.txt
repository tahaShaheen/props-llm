SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how to improve the policy for the cartpole environment using reinforcement learning. The goal is to balance the pole and keep the cart within its bounds. 

First, let me understand the setup. The state includes the cart's position, velocity, pole angle, and angular velocity. The action is either pushing left or right, which translates into values of 0 or 1 in a linear policy defined by matrices W and B.

The reward function rewards each step where the pole is upright (angle close to 0) and the cart is within bounds. So, the more times these conditions are met, the higher the episodic reward f(params).

Looking at the parameters provided, they're all between -6.0 and 6.0 with one decimal place. The goal is to find params that maximize f(params). From the given data points, around 500 seems achievable, but the user wants me to explore instead of exploiting.

I see that the best reward from the examples is 402.20. To improve further, I need to adjust these parameters. 

Let's look at one example where f(params) is 321.00. The params here are [-5; -2.4; -1.8; 0.7; ...]. I notice that pushing the cart (action 1) might be beneficial when the pole is upright and the cart isn't too fast. Maybe increasing action 1 could help, but caution to not overshoot.

Another example with f=309.55 uses [-5; -2.4; 0.8; ...]. Here, pushing left a bit seems better because the pole isn't upright yet. But perhaps I should consider if that's the best push or if another action might be better when pole is upright.

Looking at the most recent examples with f=97.50 and 9.50, the params there have more extreme values, like [-5; 2.4; ...]. These seem to indicate that sometimes pushing right (action 1) helps a lot when the pole is balanced. However, this might not be globally optimal.

I should also consider the velocity parameters. If the cart or pole is moving too fast, it's harder to balance. So perhaps increasing some of these could help maintain stability.

Another thought: the action space is fixed with two options. Maybe there's a way to find a better combination by trying different weights in W and B. But since I don't have the exact parameters yet, it's hard to adjust without more data.

I'll start by tweaking the push right action (-1) parameter (B[0]) a bit higher. Maybe increase it from -1 to 0.7 or something. Also, perhaps decreasing the left action (-4.5) in one example could help when pole is upright and cart isn't too fast.

Wait, in some examples where f=321, B[-1] was -1.8. If I increase it to 0.7, maybe that's better because when pole is upright, pushing left would require more force than right. So increasing push left (B[0]) might help balance the pole.

Also, looking at velocity parameters. The cart velocity (-inf to inf) could make it hard. Maybe increasing B[1] a bit if pushing right seems better in some cases.

I also notice that some params have +2.4 for B[1], which is the cart velocity parameter. If I adjust this, maybe it helps with faster movements when balancing.

But without more examples or data points, adjusting too much could lead to instability or divergence. I need to be cautious not to overshoot in any parameter.

Perhaps a combination of these adjustments: increasing push left (B[0]) and adjusting cart velocity (B[1]). Also, maybe tweaking B[2] and B[3] for pole angle and angular velocity.

Wait, looking at the parameters that gave f=97.50 and 9.50, which are lower rewards, might indicate that sometimes more aggressive actions aren't working well. So perhaps these are not good generalizations but specific cases where certain actions are better.

I think a balanced approach would be to try varying each action parameter slightly. For example:

- Try increasing B[0] by 1 from -4.5 to -3.5.
- Decrease B[2] (pole angle) from -3.5 to maybe -2.5 or something if that improves balancing.

But I'm not sure about the exact values. It's all trial and error, and I might need more data points or the actual RL algorithm's output to guide these changes accurately.
