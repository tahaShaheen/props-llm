SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 201 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, I need to help the user find the optimal parameters for their cartpole environment. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward f(params) by adjusting the 10 parameters of the linear policy.

First, looking at the provided examples, most of them have rewards around 397.8 or higher. For instance, one example has a reward of 450.90 and another with 437.80. It seems like the best results are in the upper range of the parameter space.

I should focus on adjusting parameters to get as high a reward as possible. Since the cart needs to be balanced, having a pole that stays upright is crucial. This suggests that the action (params[1]) should be negative enough to push the cart back if needed.

The velocity parameters (params[3] and [5]) are important because if the pole tips over quickly, especially on the right side (params[5]), it's bad. So pushing left (-1) is better than pushing right (+1).

Looking at the reward formula, every time the pole stays upright and the cart is within bounds gives +1. The final reward could be high when the pole doesn't fall over and the cart doesn't go off track.

Considering all this, I should target parameter values that push the cart back, correct the pole angle, keep it balanced, and avoid extreme movements for the actions. Parameters around -4 to 6 seem promising because they allow sufficient flexibility without making adjustments too sharp or too gentle.

I'll start by setting params[0] to -5 and adjust others accordingly. Let me see if that makes sense based on the examples given.
