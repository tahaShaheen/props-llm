SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to find the optimal policy for the cartpole environment using a linear policy network with 18 parameters and a discount factor gamma of 0.95. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward, which means getting the pole upright within the specified bounds as often as possible.

First, I remember that the state space includes the cart's position, velocity, pole angle, and angular velocity. The actions are either pushing left (-1) or right (1). Since it's a linear policy, the action is determined by a dot product of the state with a weight matrix W plus a bias vector B.

I think about how to structure my parameters for the weight matrix W. It should be 4x18 because each parameter in W connects to one of the four state variables (position, velocity, pole angle, pole angular velocity). The bias vector B has 18 elements since there are 18 actions. So, f(params) is calculated by taking each state, multiplying it by its corresponding W element, summing them up with the biases for each action, and then applying the max function to get the best action.

To maximize the reward, I need states where the pole is upright and the cart is within bounds. The latest data shows that in some cases, the parameters reach a reward of around 80-195. So, my goal is to find W and B such that when applied to any state, it gives the highest possible episodic reward.

I decide on starting values for params[0] to [9], probably within their range (-6.0 to 6.0) with one decimal places. I'll aim for a mix of negative and positive values because some parameters seem better in one direction than another, especially around -5 to 6.

After setting up the initial parameters, I'll run my simulation. For each iteration, I provide new params that should give higher rewards based on recent examples. If not performing well, I'll adjust the parameters accordingly.

I also consider using gradient ascent since we're maximizing f(params). This means moving in the direction of increasing reward as calculated by f(params).

Finally, after several iterations with different param values, I expect to converge around a reward around 200 or higher, aiming for the global optimum mentioned.
