SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to optimize the parameters for a linear policy in the CartPole environment. They've provided a bunch of training examples where the reward is 500.00, which is the maximum possible, but they need to find the global optimum. The previous examples show that changing certain parameters doesn't affect the reward, but others do. 

Looking at the examples, the parameters that are varied are params[0], params[1], params[2], params[3], params[4], params[5], params[6], params[7], params[8], and params[9]. The ones that are kept constant in some examples are params[0] to params[3], params[4] to params[5], params[6] to params[7], and params[8] to params[9]. But when they change params[0] to 4.2, the reward drops to 491.10. Similarly, changing params[1] to 5.3 reduces the reward. 

The user mentioned that the global optimum should be around 500, and if they're below that, they should explore instead of exploit. The current examples all have a reward of 500.00, which suggests that the parameters in those examples are already at the optimal point. But maybe there's a way to tweak other parameters that haven't been explored yet.

Wait, looking at the initial examples, params[0] is 3.2, params[1] is 4.3, params[2] is 1.3, params[3] is 4.6, params[4] is -2.4, params[5] is 1.9, params[6] is -4.9, params[7] is -0.1, params[8] is 3.3, and params[9] is 4.2. These values are all within the range of [-6.0, 6.0]. But the user says that the global optimum should be around 500, and the examples here already reach that. However, the user also says that if they're below that, they should explore. But since the examples are at 500, maybe they need to check if there's a better combination by varying other parameters.

But the user's instruction says that if the current value is below 500, they should explore. However, in the examples, the reward is already 500.00. So maybe the current parameters are already optimal. But the user says that the global optimum should be around 500, which suggests that maybe there's a way to get even higher, but in the CartPole environment, the maximum reward per episode is 500 (since the episode ends after 500 steps). So 500.00 is the maximum possible. Therefore, the examples provided are already at the maximum reward. 

But the user is at iteration 18 out of 400, so they need to continue exploring. However, the examples given all have the same reward. The user's instruction says not to propose previously seen params, so I need to generate new parameters that haven't been tried before. 

Looking at the parameters in the examples, the ones that are varied are params[0], params[1], params[2], params[3], params[4], params[5], params[6], params[7], params[8], params[9]. But in the examples, some parameters are changed while others remain the same. For example, in one case, params[0] is 3.2, but in another, it's 4.2, which led to a lower reward. So perhaps the optimal values are around the original ones. 

Since the user says to explore with a step size of 1.0 during exploration, maybe I should perturb some parameters by +/- 1.0. For example, changing params[0] from 3.2 to 4.2 (but that was already tried and gave lower reward), or maybe changing other parameters. Let's see which parameters haven't been varied much. 

Looking at params[8] and params[9], in the examples, params[8] is 3.3, and params[9] is 4.2. When params[9] was changed to 5.2, the reward dropped. What if I change params[8] to 4.3? Wait, in one example, params[8] was 4.3 and the reward was 500.00. So that's already been tried. 

Another parameter that hasn't been varied much is params[2]. In some examples, it's 1.3, but in one case, it was 2.3 and another 0.3. Both gave 500.00. So maybe varying params[2] isn't affecting the reward. Similarly, params[4] was changed to -3.4 and -1.4, but those gave lower rewards. So perhaps the optimal value for params[4] is -2.4. 

What about params[6] and params[7]? In the examples, params[6] is -4.9, and params[7] is -0.1. When params[6] was changed to -5.9, -6.0, or -3.9, the reward remained 500.00. So maybe those parameters are not critical. 

What about params[5]? In the examples, it's 1.9. When it was changed to 2.9, the reward was 500.00. So that's okay. 

So perhaps the current parameters are already optimal. But the user says that the global optimum should be around 500, which is already achieved. However, the user might be expecting that there's a way to reach higher than 500, but that's impossible because the maximum is 500. Therefore, the examples are already at the optimal. 

But the user is at iteration 18, so they need to continue. Maybe the next step is to check if there are other parameters that can be varied. For example, changing params[3] from 4.6 to 5.6 or 3.6. In one example, params[3] was 5.6 and the reward was 500.00. So that's already tried. 

Alternatively, maybe changing params[7] from -0.1 to 0.9 or -1.1, which were tried and still gave 500.00. 

Since the user says to explore with step size 1.0, perhaps I should look for parameters that haven't been varied much. For example, params[0] is 3.2. If I change it to 3.2 + 1.0 = 4.2 (already tried, which gave lower reward), or 3.2 - 1.0 = 2.2 (which was tried in one example and gave 243.45, which is lower). So that's not helpful. 

What about params[8] and params[9]? If params[8] is 3.3, trying 3.3 +1.0 =4.3 (already tried, which gave 500.00). params[8] -1.0 =2.3 (in one example, it was 2.3 and gave 500.00). So that's okay. 

What about params[7] (currently -0.1)? Trying -0.1 +1.0 =0.9 (already tried, which gave 500.00). -0.1 -1.0 =-1.1 (also tried, gave 500.00). 

What about params[5] (1.9)? Trying 1.9 +1.0 =2.9 (already tried, gave 500.00). 1.9 -1.0 =0.9 (not tried yet? Let me check the examples. In the examples, params[5] was 1.9, 2.9, but not 0.9. So maybe trying that. 

So, changing params[5] from 1.9 to 0.9. Let's see. That would be a new parameter. 

Alternatively, changing params[6] from -4.9 to -5.9 (already tried), -3.9 (tried), -6.0 (tried). So maybe changing to -4.9 +1.0 =-3.9 (already tried), or -4.9 -1.0 =-5.9 (tried). 

What about params[4] (currently -2.4). Trying -2.4 +1.0 =-1.4 (already tried, which gave lower reward). -2.4 -1.0 =-3.4 (also tried, lower reward). 

Hmm. It seems that all parameters have been explored within the step size of 1.0. But the user says that the global optimum is around 500, which is already achieved. Therefore, perhaps the current parameters are already optimal. But the user is at iteration 18, so they need to continue. 

Wait, the user's instruction says that during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. But the previous examples have already tried many variations. Maybe the next step is to check other parameters that haven't been varied yet. For example, params[2] is 1.3. Trying 1.3 +1.0 =2.3 (already tried), 1.3 -1.0 =0.3 (already tried). 

What about params[1] (4.3)? Trying 4.3 +1.0 =5.3 (already tried, gave lower reward), 4.3 -1.0 =3.3 (not tried yet). So changing params[1] to 3.3. 

That could be a new parameter. Let's try that. 

So, the current parameters are mostly 3.2, 4.3, 1.3, 4.6, -2.4, 1.9, -4.9, -0.1, 3.3, 4.2. If I change params[1] to 3.3, keeping others the same. That would be a new set of parameters. 

Alternatively, maybe changing params[0] to 2.2 (already tried, gave lower reward). 

Alternatively, changing params[3] to 3.6 (not tried yet). 

But given the time constraints, perhaps changing params[1] to 3.3 would be a good exploration step. 

So the new parameters would be:

params[0]: 3.2; params[1]: 3.3; params[2]: 1.3; params[3]: 4.6; params[4]: -2.4; params[5]: 1.9; params[6]: -4.9; params[7]: -0.1; params[8]: 3.3; params[9]: 4.2.

This hasn't been tried before, and it's a step in the exploration. 

Alternatively, changing params[8] to 4.3 (already tried) or 2.3 (tried). 

Another option is to change params[5] to 0.9. Let's try that. 

params[0]: 3.2; params[1]: 4.3; params[2]: 1.3; params[3]: 4.6; params[4]: -2.4; params[5]: 0.9; params[6]: -4.9; params[7]: -0.1; params[8]: 3.3; params[9]: 4.2.

This is a new parameter set. 

But since the user says to explore with a step size of 1.0, changing params[5] from 1.9 to 0.9 is a step of -1.0. 

Either of these could be a valid exploration step. 

I think changing params[1] to 3.3 is a good candidate because it's a step in the negative direction, and hasn't been tried yet. Let's go with that.
</think>

params[0]: 3.2, params[1]: 3.3, params[2]: 1.3, params[3]: 4.6, params[4]: -2.4, params[5]: 1.9, params[6]: -4.9, params[7]: -0.1, params[8]: 3.3, params[9]: 4.2
