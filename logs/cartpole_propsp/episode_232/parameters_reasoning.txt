SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 232 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user provided some examples of parameters and their corresponding rewards. The goal is to find the global optimum, which they mentioned should be around 500. The current best example has a reward of 500.00 with params like [6, 2.3, -5, 6, 5.3, 6, -6, 6, 5, 5]. But the user says that if we're below 500, we should explore instead of exploit. 

Looking at the examples, the highest reward is 500.00. However, the user is at iteration 232 out of 400, so there's still room for exploration. The instruction says during exploration, use a search step size of 1.0. That means we should perturb the parameters by ±1.0 from the current values to explore new areas.

The current top params have some values at the extremes, like 6 and -6. Maybe there's a better combination nearby. Let's consider changing some parameters. For example, in the first example, params[1] is 2.3. If we increase it by 1.0 to 3.3, but looking at another example where params[1] is 3.3, the reward was 389.85, which is lower. So maybe decreasing it isn't the way. Alternatively, maybe adjusting other parameters.

Looking at params[4] and params[5], they are both 5.3 and 6. Maybe adjusting those. Also, params[6] is -6, and params[7] is 6. Perhaps changing those. But since the user wants exploration, we should try varying parameters that are at the extremes. For example, changing params[2] from -5 to -6 (since it's already at -5 in some examples). Or maybe changing params[8] or params[9], which are 5 and 5 in the best example. Increasing them to 6 might help, but in one example, when params[8] was 6 and params[9] was 5, the reward was 349.65, which is lower. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe changing params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3? But the parameters are constrained to [-6.0, 6.0], so 6.3 is invalid. So the maximum is 6.0. So maybe increasing params[4] to 6.0. Wait, in one example, params[4] is 6.0 and the reward was 465.70, which is lower than 500. So that might not be helpful.

Another approach: look for parameters that have been changed in other examples. For instance, in some examples, params[1] is 1.3, which is lower than 2.3. Maybe trying a value between 1.3 and 2.3. But since we need to explore with a step of 1.0, perhaps changing params[1] from 2.3 to 3.3 (but that was tried and gave lower reward). Alternatively, changing it to 1.3 (but that's already tried). 

Wait, the user said during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So, if we take the current best params (which are 6, 2.3, -5, 6, 5.3, 6, -6, 6, 5, 5), we can perturb each parameter by ±1.0. Let's consider each parameter:

params[0] is 6.0 (max), so can't increase. Maybe decrease to 5.0.

params[1] is 2.3. Adding 1.0 gives 3.3 (already tried, lower reward). Subtracting 1.0 gives 1.3 (also tried, lower reward).

params[2] is -5.0. Adding 1.0 gives -4.0 (which was in an example with 499.95 reward). Subtracting 1.0 gives -6.0 (which was in another example with 497.35 reward). So maybe trying -4.0.

params[3] is 6.0. Can't increase. Decrease to 5.0.

params[4] is 5.3. Adding 0.7 gives 6.0, but step size is 1.0. So adding 1.0 would be 6.3 (invalid). So can't. Subtract 1.0 to 4.3 (which was in an example with 499.35 reward).

params[5] is 6.0. Same as params[3]. Decrease to 5.0.

params[6] is -6.0. Can't decrease. Increase to -5.0 (which was in an example with 498.55 reward).

params[7] is 6.0. Decrease to 5.0.

params[8] is 5.0. Can increase to 6.0 or decrease to 4.0.

params[9] is 5.0. Same as params[8].

So, to explore, maybe change some parameters. For example, changing params[2] from -5 to -4 (which was tried but gave 499.95), or params[4] from 5.3 to 4.3 (which was tried). Alternatively, change params[8] and params[9] to 6.0. Let's try that. Let's take the current best params and adjust params[8] and params[9] to 6.0. So:

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 2.3, params[2]: -5, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 5.3, params[5]: 6, params[6]: -6, params[7]: 6, params[8]: 6, params[9]: 6. But in one example, this was tried and the reward was 497.35. So that's lower. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe changing params[2] to -4 and params[4] to 4.3. Let's see. That would be:

params[0]:6, params[1]:2.3, params[2]:-4, params[3]:6, params[4]:4.3, params[5]:6, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:5, params[9]:5. Which was in an example with 499.35 reward.

Alternatively, trying to change params[1] to 3.3, but that was lower. So maybe not.

Wait, the user says to avoid previously seen params. So the current best is 500.00. The next step is to explore. Maybe try changing params[8] and params[9] from 5 to 6. But that was tried and gave lower. So perhaps changing other parameters. Maybe params[6] from -6 to -5. Let's try that. So:

params[0]:6, params[1]:2.3, params[2]:-5, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:6, params[6]:-5, params[7]:6, params[8]:5, params[9]:5. Which was in an example with 498.55 reward. Still lower.

Alternatively, maybe changing params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3 (invalid). No. Or to 4.3 (already tried).

Another approach: look at parameters that have not been changed much. For example, params[2] is -5, maybe try -6. Let's see. If we change params[2] to -6, and others stay the same. So:

params[0]:6, params[1]:2.3, params[2]:-6, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:6, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:5, params[9]:5. Which was in an example with 497.35 reward. Lower than 500.

Hmm. Maybe changing params[3] from 6 to 5. Let's try that. So:

params[0]:6, params[1]:2.3, params[2]:-5, params[3]:5, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:6, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:5, params[9]:5. Not sure if that's been tried. Let's check the examples. In the example with params[3]:5, the reward was 497.15. Lower.

Alternatively, maybe changing params[7] from 6 to 5. Let's try:

params[0]:6, params[1]:2.3, params[2]:-5, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:6, params[6]:-6, params[7]:5, params[8]:5, params[9]:5. Not sure if that's been tried. Maybe not. So that's a new param set. Let's try that. 

But the user wants exploration with step size 1.0. So changing params[7] from 6 to 5 is a step of -1.0. That's valid. Let's go with that. So the new params would be:

params[0]:6, params[1]:2.3, params[2]:-5, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:6, params[6]:-6, params[7]:5, params[8]:5, params[9]:5.

Alternatively, maybe changing params[0] from 6 to 5. Let's try that. So:

params[0]:5, params[1]:2.3, params[2]:-5, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:6, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:5, params[9]:5. Not sure if that's been tried. Let's see. In the example where params[0] was 5, the reward was 497.15. Lower than 500.

Hmm. Maybe trying to change multiple parameters. For example, decrease params[0] to 5, increase params[1] to 3.3 (but that was tried and lower). Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe changing params[2] from -5 to -4 (already tried, gives 499.95), which is slightly lower than 500. So that's close. Maybe that's a good candidate for exploration. But the user said to avoid previously seen params. Wait, the example with params[2] = -4 was tried and gave 499.95. So that's a new param set? No, because the user said not to propose previously seen params. So if that's already in the examples, we can't use it again. 

Looking back at the examples, the first example had params[2]: -5, which gave 500.00. The second example had params[2]:-4, which gave 499.95. So that's a previously seen param. So we can't use that. So we need to find a new param set that hasn't been tried before. 

What about changing params[4] from 5.3 to 4.3 (already tried, 499.35). Or maybe changing params[8] and params[9] from 5 to 6. But that was tried and gave lower. 

Alternatively, maybe changing params[6] from -6 to -5. Whichสิ่ง

params[0]:6, params[1]:2.3, params[2]:-5, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:6, params[6]:-5, params[7]:6, params[8]:5, params[9]:5. This was in an example with 498.55 reward. Lower than 500, but not previously tried? Wait, in the examples, the user had:

"params[6]:-5" in an example with 498.55. So that's a previously seen param. Can't use that.

Hmm. This is challenging. Maybe try changing params[8] and params[9] to 4.0. Let's try that. So:

params[0]:6, params[1]:2.3, params[2]:-5, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:6, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:4, params[9]:4. Not sure if that's been tried. If not, this is a new param set. Let's go with that. 

But I need to ensure it's not in the previous examples. Looking back, I don't see that combination. So this might be a valid exploration step. 

Alternatively, change params[7] to 5 and params[8] to 6. Let's try:

params[0]:6, params[1]:2.3, params[2]:-5, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:6, params[6]:-6, params[7]:5, params[8]:6, params[9]:5. This is a new param set, not seen before. 

But I'm not sure if this is the best approach. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with changing params[7] to 5 and keeping others as in the best param set. 

Final answer: 

params[0]:6, params[1]:2.3, params[2]:-5, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:6, params[6]:-6, params[7]:5, params[8]:5, params[9]:5. 

This param set hasn't been explicitly mentioned in the examples, so it's a valid exploration step.
