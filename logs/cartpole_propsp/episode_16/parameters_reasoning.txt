SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

Now you are at iteration 16 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of training examples for the cartpole environment with different params and their corresponding rewards. The goal is to find the global optimal policy, which they mentioned should be around 500. But looking at the examples, the highest reward so far is 224.50. So there's a lot of room for improvement.

First, I need to analyze the patterns in the params that lead to higher rewards. Looking at the examples where the reward is high, like the one with 224.50, the params are:

params[0]: -3.8; params[1]: 2.5; params[2]: 5.6; params[3]: 5.6; params[4]: -5.6; params[5]: 3.6; params[6]: -5.3; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 2.7; params[9]: 2.9; f(params): 224.50

Hmm, here, some of the parameters are at the upper limit of 6.0, like params[2], params[3], params[7]. Also, params[0] is -3.8, which is negative. Maybe there's a pattern where certain weights are high positive or negative, and the bias terms are also positive.

Another high-reward example is params[0]: -2.8; params[1]: 2.5; params[2]: 5.6; params[3]: 5.6; params[4]: -4.6; params[5]: 3.6; params[6]: -5.3; params[7]: 5.6; params[8]: 1.7; params[9]: 1.9; f(params): 203.55. Here, similar patterns but with slightly different values.

Looking at the W matrix structure. Each row corresponds to a state variable (cart position, velocity, pole angle, angular velocity) and their weights for each action. The bias B adds to each action's score.

For the policy to balance the pole, the action (left or right) should be chosen based on the state. For example, if the pole is leaning to the right (positive angle), the cart should move left (action 0) to balance it. So the weights for the pole angle might be positive for action 0 and negative for action 1, or something like that. But since the policy is linear, the weights need to be set such that the action choice is correct based on the state.

But maybe the high-reward params have certain weights that make the policy respond correctly to the state variables. For instance, in the example with 224.50, params[2] and params[3] are 5.6 and 5.6. These are the weights for the pole angle in the two actions. If the pole angle is positive (leaning right), then the action would be determined by the dot product of the state with W plus B. If the weights for action 0 are high positive and for action 1 are high negative, then when the pole angle is positive, action 0 would be chosen. That might help in balancing.

But how to find the optimal parameters? The user mentioned that during exploration, the step size should be 1.0. So maybe we need to explore around the current high-performing parameters by adding or subtracting 1.0 from each parameter.

Looking at the previous example with 224.50, let's consider modifying the parameters. For example, params[0] is -3.8. If we increase it by 1.0 to -2.8, which is within the range. Similarly, params[4] is -5.6. If we decrease it by 1.0 to -6.6 (but that's below -6.0, which is the lower limit, so maybe we can't go there). Alternatively, increase it to -4.6. Wait, the current value is -5.6. So adding 1.0 would be -4.6, which is allowed.

Alternatively, maybe increasing some parameters that are lower than 6.0. For instance, params[7] is 6.0, which is the max. So we can't increase that. But maybe other parameters can be adjusted.

Another approach: the previous example had params[8] and params[9] as 2.7 and 2.9. Maybe increasing those could help. But since they are already positive, perhaps adding 1.0 would take them to 3.7 and 3.9, which is allowed.

But the user said that during exploration, the step size is 1.0. So I should take the current best parameters (the one with 224.50) and perturb each parameter by +/-1.0, ensuring they stay within [-6.0, 6.0]. Then, generate new params by doing that.

Let me take the params from the 224.50 example:

params[0]: -3.8; params[1]: 2.5; params[2]: 5.6; params[3]: 5.6; params[4]: -5.6; params[5]: 3.6; params[6]: -5.3; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 2.7; params[9]: 2.9

Now, for each parameter, I can try adding or subtracting 1.0, but making sure they stay within the range.

For example, params[0] is -3.8. Adding 1.0 gives -2.8 (allowed), subtracting 1.0 gives -4.8 (allowed).

params[1] is 2.5. Adding 1.0 gives 3.5, subtracting gives 1.5.

params[2] is 5.6. Adding 1.0 would be 6.6, which is over the max, so can't. Subtracting 1.0 gives 4.6.

params[3] is 5.6. Same as params[2].

params[4] is -5.6. Adding 1.0 gives -4.6, subtracting gives -6.6 (over the limit, so can't). So only adding 1.0.

params[5] is 3.6. Adding 1.0 gives 4.6, subtracting gives 2.6.

params[6] is -5.3. Adding 1.0 gives -4.3, subtracting gives -6.3 (over limit). So only adding.

params[7] is 6.0. Can't add, subtract to 5.0.

params[8] is 2.7. Add 1.0 to 3.7, subtract to 1.7.

params[9] is 2.9. Add to 3.9, subtract to 1.9.

Now, the idea is to create new params by changing each parameter by +/-1.0 where possible. Since the user wants exploration, not exploitation, we should try these variations to see if any of them lead to higher rewards.

But since the user is at iteration 16 out of 400, and the previous best is 224.50, maybe trying to explore around that.

For example, let's take params[0] from -3.8 to -2.8 (adding 1.0). Also, maybe increase params[1] from 2.5 to 3.5. Similarly, for params[4], increase from -5.6 to -4.6. For params[5], increase from 3.6 to 4.6. For params[6], increase from -5.3 to -4.3. For params[7], decrease from 6.0 to 5.0. For params[8], increase to 3.7. For params[9], increase to 3.9. 

So the new params would be:

params[0]: -2.8; params[1]: 3.5; params[2]: 5.6 (unchanged? Or maybe also adjust. Wait, earlier I thought to change params[2] and [3] by subtracting 1.0, but if I'm just exploring, maybe not all parameters. Alternatively, pick one parameter to change at a time. However, since the user wants exploration, perhaps trying multiple variations. But since the user can only propose one set of params per iteration, I need to choose one.

Alternatively, pick a parameter that's not at the edge. For example, params[0] is -3.8. Let's try increasing it to -2.8. That might be a good candidate. Also, maybe adjust params[4] from -5.6 to -4.6. Let's see:

New params:

params[0]: -2.8; params[1]: 2.5; params[2]: 5.6; params[3]: 5.6; params[4]: -4.6; params[5]: 3.6; params[6]: -5.3; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 2.7; params[9]: 2.9.

This is similar to the previous example with 203.55. But that had a lower reward. So maybe that's not the best direction. Alternatively, try increasing params[1] to 3.5, and see.

Alternatively, perhaps increasing params[8] and [9] to 3.7 and 3.9. Let's try that.

params[0]: -3.8; params[1]: 2.5; params[2]: 5.6; params[3]: 5.6; params[4]: -5.6; params[5]: 3.6; params[6]: -5.3; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 3.7; params[9]: 3.9.

This might lead to a higher reward. But since the previous example had params[8] and [9] at 2.7 and 2.9, increasing them could help. Also, maybe adjusting params[4] from -5.6 to -4.6 (but that would be a different change).

Alternatively, let's look at the example where params[0] is -3.8, params[1] is 2.5, params[2] is 5.6, params[3] is 5.6, params[4] is -5.6, params[5] is 3.6, params[6] is -5.3, params[7] is 6, params[8] is 2.7, params[9] is 2.9. Let's try increasing params[8] and [9] by 1.0 each. That would be 3.7 and 3.9. Let's see if that's allowed. Yes, since they are within -6.0 to 6.0.

So the new params would be:

params[0]: -3.8; params[1]: 2.5; params[2]: 5.6; params[3]: 5.6; params[4]: -5.6; params[5]: 3.6; params[6]: -5.3; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 3.7; params[9]: 3.9.

This is one possible exploration step. Another could be adjusting params[0] to -2.8. But since the user wants exploration, trying different directions is important.

Alternatively, maybe increasing params[2] and [3] from 5.6 to 6.0. But they are already at 5.6, so adding 0.4 would get to 6.0. However, the step size is 1.0, so can't do that. So maybe not.

Alternatively, looking at params[6] which is -5.3. Adding 1.0 gives -4.3. So maybe that's a good move.

But given that the user is at iteration 16, and we need to propose a new set of params, I should choose one of these variations. Since the previous best had params[8] and [9] at 2.7 and 2.9, increasing them might be beneficial. So the new params would be:

params[0]: -3.8; params[1]: 2.5; params[2]: 5.6; params[3]: 5.6; params[4]: -5.6; params[5]: 3.6; params[6]: -5.3; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 3.7; params[9]: 3.9.

But I need to check if this is a new set of params. Looking at the previous examples, this hasn't been tried before. So this could be a candidate.

params[0]: -3.8; params[1]: 2.5; params[2]: 5.6; params[3]: 5.6; params[4]: -5.6; params[5]: 3.6; params[6]: -5.3; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 3.7; params[9]: 3.9
