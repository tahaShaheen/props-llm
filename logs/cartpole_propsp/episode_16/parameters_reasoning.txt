SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of training examples with different params and their corresponding f(params) values. The goal is to find the optimal params that maximize the episodic reward, aiming for around 500. The current examples have the highest f(params) at 247.15, which is way below 500. So, I need to explore more to find a better solution.

Looking at the examples, the first one with params[0] 4, params[1] -1.7, etc., gives 247.15. The next ones have similar params but lower rewards. The user mentioned that during exploration, a step size of 1.0 should be used. So, maybe I should take the current best params and adjust them by adding or subtracting 1.0 to each parameter to explore new areas.

Wait, the current best is params[0]:4, params[1]:-1.7, params[2]:-4, params[3]:3.2, params[4]:0.3, params[5]:-2.2, params[6]:-6, params[7]:5.2, params[8]:2.3, params[9]:1.8. Let's consider varying each parameter by +/-1.0. For example, increasing params[0] from 4 to 5 or 3, or changing params[3] from 3.2 to 4.2 or 2.2. Also, looking at other parameters, maybe adjusting params[6] from -6 to -5 or -7 (but within the -6 to 6 range). Similarly for others.

But the user said not to propose previously seen params. The first example had params[0] 4, params[1] -1.7, etc. So, if I adjust some parameters, I need to ensure they haven't been tried before. For instance, changing params[3] from 3.2 to 4.2 (which is within the range) might be a new direction. Also, looking at other parameters, maybe increasing params[7] from 5.2 to 6.2 (but wait, the maximum is 6.0). So 6.0 is the upper limit. So maybe 6.0.

Alternatively, looking at other parameters. For example, params[8] is 2.3. Maybe increasing that to 3.3 or decreasing to 1.3. But need to check if those values have been used before. The examples don't show those exact values, so it's safe to try.

Another approach is to look for parameters that might be contributing more. For instance, in the current best, params[6] is -6, which is the minimum. Maybe increasing that to -5 could help. Similarly, params[7] is 5.2, which is close to 6.0. Maybe increasing that to 6.0.

Also, looking at the reward, 247 is low. The global optimum is supposed to be around 500, so there's a lot of room for improvement. Perhaps the current parameters are not in the right direction. Maybe trying different combinations where some parameters are positive and others negative in different ways.

But since the user says to use a step size of 1.0 during exploration, I should take the current best and perturb each parameter by +/-1.0. Let's try that.

Take the current best params:

params[0] = 4.0 → try 5.0 or 3.0
params[1] = -1.7 → try -0.7 or -2.7
params[2] = -4.0 → try -3.0 or -5.0
params[3] = 3.2 → try 4.2 or 2.2
params[4] = 0.3 → try 1.3 or -0.7
params[5] = -2.2 → try -1.2 or -3.2
params[6] = -6.0 → try -5.0 (since -6 is already the minimum)
params[7] = 5.2 → try 6.2 (but max is 6.0) or 4.2
params[8] = 2.3 → try 3.3 or 1.3
params[9] = 1.8 → try 2.8 or 0.8

Now, need to pick one of these variations. Since the user wants exploration, maybe pick a variation that hasn't been tried before. For example, increasing params[0] to 5.0, params[3] to 4.2, and params[7] to 6.0. Let's see:

params[0] = 5.0
params[1] = -1.7 (same as before)
params[2] = -4.0
params[3] = 4.2
params[4] = 0.3
params[5] = -2.2
params[6] = -5.0
params[7] = 6.0
params[8] = 2.3
params[9] = 1.8

This is a new set of parameters. Let me check if this has been tried before. Looking at the examples, the second example had params[3] as 3.1, but this is 4.2. Also, params[6] was -4.9 in some examples, but here it's -5.0. So this is new.

Alternatively, maybe changing params[1] to -0.7. Let's try that:

params[0] = 4.0
params[1] = -0.7
params[2] = -4.0
params[3] = 3.2
params[4] = 0.3
params[5] = -2.2
params[6] = -6.0
params[7] = 5.2
params[8] = 2.3
params[9] = 1.8

But in the examples, there's one where params[1] is -0.7, but other parameters might be different. For example, in the 14th example, params[1] is -0.7, but other parameters are different. So this might be a new combination.

But since the user wants exploration with step size 1.0, maybe the first variation I thought of (increasing params[0], params[3], and params[7]) is better. Let's go with that.
</think>

params[0]: 5.0, params[1]: -1.7, params[2]: -4.0, params[3]: 4.2, params[4]: 0.3, params[5]: -2.2, params[6]: -5.0, params[7]: 6.0, params[8]: 2.3, params[9]: 1.8
