SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what the parameters should be for this cartpole environment to get a reward of around 500. The current setup with certain parameters already gives 500, and others are lower. But I want to make sure that's the highest possible.

First, I think about how the policy works. It uses a linear function approximator, so the state is [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity], and the action is based on multiplying this state by W (a 18x4 matrix) plus B (a vector). The reward is +1 each time the pole stays upright within certain bounds.

I remember that for cartpole, keeping the pole upright is really important. If the pole falls over, the episode ends. Also, if the cart goes beyond -2.4 or 2.4, it's an end. So I want to find a balance where the pole doesn't tip too much and the cart stays steady.

Looking at the current parameters: W seems to have some positive values for certain states and negative others. B is another vector that might influence the actions. Maybe increasing some velocities or angles would help keep the pole upright.

I think about each parameter's effect. For example, params[0] is the weight for cart_position in state[0]. If I increase this, pushing left (pushing right if it's negative) more when the position is high might make the cart go further, which could destabilize the pole. On the other hand, making it negative would push less when the position is high.

Similarly, params[1] affects cart_velocity. If I set it to a positive value, pushing left (params[1]=6) would reduce velocity more than pushing right (-4.5). That might dampen oscillations, which is good for stability.

Looking at the reward function: each time step where pole upright and within bounds gives +1. So if params are too negative in certain states, it could make those conditions false, reducing rewards.

I also notice that some parameters are set to -4.5 or 6. Maybe using more balanced values could help avoid some extremes that might destabilize the system.

Let me consider increasing params[0] and params[1]. For example, if I set them both higher, maybe to 6, which is at their max. That would push the cart in all directions when it's moving, which might give more time for the pole to stay upright without the cart getting too unstable.

Also, looking at params[2], which affects the pole angle. A higher negative value (like -3) makes poles tend to fall down, so perhaps making it less negative or even positive could help balance that. Maybe setting it closer to 0 would be better.

params[3] is for pole angular velocity, and setting it higher might make poles spin faster, which isn't good if the pole needs to stay upright. So perhaps keeping it moderate or slightly decreased could help maintain the balance.

I also need to check other parameters, like params[4] and 5 being -6 and 1.8. If these are too negative, they would push more on the cart's velocity when the pole is upright, which might cause more oscillations. So maybe adjusting them up a bit could help stabilize things.

Overall, I think setting params to higher values in some states (like cart_position and velocity) and moderate or positive for others (pole angle and angular velocity) might lead to a better reward. Maybe around 6 for all except params[4] which is -6, so perhaps balancing them without making some too extreme.

I should test this by adjusting these parameters step by step and see how the reward changes. If I start with higher values in states that affect stability, maybe I can get more rewards before the pole falls over or cart goes out of bounds.
