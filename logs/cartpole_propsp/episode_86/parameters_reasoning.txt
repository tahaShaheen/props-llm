SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 86 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has given me a bunch of examples of params and their corresponding f(params) values. My goal is to find the global optimal policy, which they mentioned should be around 500. The current examples have values up to 491.70, so there's room for improvement.

Looking at the top params, most of them have params[0] set to 6, params[1] around 1.3, and some variation in the other parameters. The highest reward here is 491.70. The user said to explore instead of exploit if we're below 500. So maybe I need to try different values, especially since the current examples are mostly clustered around certain values.

The instructions mention using a search step size of 1.0 during exploration. So, I should consider varying the parameters by +/-1.0 from the existing ones. Let's look at the parameters that are currently being used. For example, params[2] is often -6 or -5, and params[3] is 6. Maybe trying different values here could help. Also, params[8] and params[9] are often 6 or 5. Maybe adjusting those could lead to better results.

Wait, the user also mentioned that the global optimum is around 500, so we need to explore beyond the current local maximum. The current highest is 491.70. So perhaps changing some parameters that are currently set to 6 to lower values, or adjusting others that might be contributing negatively. For example, looking at params[4] and params[5], they are around 5.3 to 6. Maybe lowering them a bit could help.

Another thing to note is that the previous examples have params[0] as 6, but maybe varying that could help. However, since the highest value is already 6, maybe pushing it further isn't possible. But the parameters are allowed up to 6.0. So perhaps keeping params[0] at 6 is okay.

I need to ensure that I don't repeat the same params as before. The user emphasized that. So I should look for parameters that haven't been tried yet. For example, in the previous examples, params[2] has been -6, -5, -4, -3. Maybe trying -2 or even 0? But the step size is 1.0, so from -6, adding 1.0 would be -5, which is already tried. So maybe trying values that are not in the previous examples.

Wait, the user said to use a search step size of 1.0 during exploration. So if I take the current best params, which have params[2] as -6, I can try changing that to -7? But the parameters are constrained between -6.0 and 6.0. So -6 is the minimum. So maybe that's not possible. Hmm.

Alternatively, looking at other parameters. For example, params[4] is 5.3 in some cases. If I increase that to 6.3, but that's beyond the maximum. So no. Maybe decreasing it to 4.3? But that's a step of -1.0. But in the examples, there's a case where params[4] is 4.7. So maybe trying 4.3 could be a new value.

But the user's instruction says to use a step size of 1.0 during exploration. So perhaps adjusting parameters that are currently at the extremes. For example, if a parameter is at 6, maybe trying 5.0 (a step of -1.0). Similarly, if a parameter is at -6, trying -5.0.

Looking at the current top params, let's take the first one: params[0] is 6, params[1] is 1.3, params[2] is -6, params[3] is 6, params[4] is 5.3, params[5] is 5.7, params[6] is -6, params[7] is 6, params[8] is 6, params[9] is 6. If I try to adjust params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3 (but that's not allowed). So maybe 4.3? But that's a step of -1.0. But in the examples, there's a case where params[4] is 4.7, so maybe trying 4.3 is a new value.

Alternatively, looking at params[5] which is 5.7. If I decrease that by 1.0 to 4.7, but that's already tried. Hmm.

Another approach is to check which parameters have been varied the least. For example, params[1] has been mostly 1.3 or 2.3. Maybe trying 0.3 or 3.3? But the step size is 1.0. So from 1.3, adding or subtracting 1.0 would be 0.3 or 2.3. The 2.3 is already in the examples, so trying 0.3 could be a new value.

Similarly, for params[8] and params[9], which are often 6 or 5. Maybe trying 4.0? But again, step size is 1.0. So from 6, subtracting 1.0 would be 5, which is already tried. So maybe that's not helpful.

Wait, the user's instruction says during exploration, use a search step size of 1.0. So perhaps, for each parameter, I can generate new values by adding or subtracting 1.0 from the current values. But need to ensure that the new values are within the [-6.0, 6.0] range.

Looking at the current top params, let's take the first one again. For each parameter:

params[0] is 6.0. Can't go higher, so try 5.0.

params[1] is 1.3. Try 0.3 or 2.3. 2.3 is already in the examples, so 0.3 is new.

params[2] is -6.0. Can't go lower, so try -5.0.

params[3] is 6.0. Try 5.0.

params[4] is 5.3. Try 4.3 or 6.3 (but 6.3 is invalid). So 4.3.

params[5] is 5.7. Try 4.7 or 6.7 (invalid). 4.7 is already in examples.

params[6] is -6.0. Try -5.0.

params[7] is 6.0. Try 5.0.

params[8] is 6.0. Try 5.0.

params[9] is 6.0. Try 5.0.

So combining these, a new set of parameters could be:

params[0]: 5.0

params[1]: 0.3

params[2]: -5.0

params[3]: 5.0

params[4]: 4.3

params[5]: 4.7

params[6]: -5.0

params[7]: 5.0

params[8]: 5.0

params[9]: 5.0

But need to check if this is within the allowed range. All values are between -6 and 6, so that's okay. Also, this set hasn't been tried before in the examples given. This could be a new exploration step.

Alternatively, another approach is to look for parameters that might be contributing negatively. For example, in the current top params, some parameters are set to 6.0, but maybe reducing those could help. However, without knowing the exact impact of each parameter, it's hard to say. But the exploration step suggests trying different values.

Another thing to note is that the user mentioned the global optimum is around 500. The current highest is 491.70, so there's a gap. Exploring new parameters could help bridge that gap. So trying the new set I mentioned above might lead to a higher reward.

But I need to make sure that I don't repeat any of the previous params. Looking at the examples, the new set I proposed (with 5.0, 0.3, etc.) hasn't been tried before. So that's a valid move.
