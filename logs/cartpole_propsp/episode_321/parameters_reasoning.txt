SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 321 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is working on optimizing a linear policy for the CartPole environment. They've provided a bunch of previous parameter sets and their corresponding rewards. The goal is to get as close as possible to the global optimum, which they mention is around 500. The current iteration is 321 out of 400, so there's still some time left.

Looking at the examples given, most of the high-reward parameters have params[0] at 6, params[1] around 2.3, params[2] around -5, params[3] at 6, params[4] and [5] around 5.3 to 6, params[6] at -6, params[7] at 6, and params[8] and [9] around 5. The rewards here are all around 500, which is the target. However, some variations, like changing params[2] to -4 or -6, resulted in lower rewards, so those might not be good directions.

The user's note says that if they're below 500, they should explore instead of exploit. Since the current examples are already hitting 500, maybe they need to look for slight variations that might push it higher. But since the examples given are already at 500, perhaps there's a need to explore other regions. However, the user also says not to propose previously seen params.

Looking at the parameters, maybe tweaking some of the other parameters that haven't been changed much. For example, params[8] and [9] are mostly at 5. Maybe trying 5.1 or 4.9 could help. Also, params[4] and [5] are around 5.3 to 6. Maybe adjusting those slightly. Also, params[2] is at -5 in most cases. Maybe trying -5.1 or -4.9?

But the user mentioned during exploration to use a step size of 1.0. However, since the current parameters are already at the edges (like 6 or -6), maybe moving them by 1.0 would take them out of the allowed range. Wait, the parameters are in the range [-6.0, 6.0], so maybe stepping by 1.0 is possible. For example, if params[0] is 6, stepping by 1.0 would take it to 7, which is out of range. So maybe the step size is 1.0 in the sense of changing by 1.0, but ensuring it stays within bounds. So perhaps adjusting some parameters by 1.0, but keeping them within the range.

Alternatively, maybe the user is suggesting that during exploration, when you're not sure, you take larger steps (1.0) to explore new areas. Since the current parameters are already at the maximum of 6 for some values, maybe trying to decrease them by 1.0 to 5.0, or increasing others if possible. However, the current high-reward parameters are already at the upper bounds for some parameters. So perhaps trying to adjust other parameters that are not at the extremes.

Looking at the current top parameters, maybe changing params[8] or [9] from 5 to 6, but that might be already tried. Wait, in one of the examples, params[8] was 6 and [9] was 5, which gave a lower reward. So maybe that's not good. Alternatively, changing params[7] from 6 to 5, but that might reduce the reward.

Alternatively, looking at params[6], which is -6 in most cases. Maybe changing that to -5, but again, that might not be helpful. The user's note says to explore both positive and negative values. So perhaps trying some parameters that are not at the extremes. For example, changing params[1] from 2.3 to 3.3 or 1.3. But since the current examples have params[1] at 2.3, maybe that's a key value.

Alternatively, looking at the parameters that have been varied. For example, in one case, params[4] was 5.3, and in another, 5.2, 5.4, etc. Maybe trying to adjust params[4] to 5.5 or 5.1. But since the previous attempts around 5.3 are already at 500, maybe that's the optimal for that parameter.

Hmm. Since the user says that the global optimum should be around 500, and the current examples are already hitting that, perhaps the next step is to explore other regions. Maybe changing some parameters that haven't been varied much. For example, params[2] is usually -5, but maybe trying -5.5 or -4.5. However, in the examples, when params[2] was -4, the reward was lower. Similarly, when it was -6, the reward was lower. So maybe -5 is the optimal for that parameter.

Another parameter that hasn't been changed much is params[8] and [9], which are usually 5. Maybe trying 5.5 or 4.5. Let's see. If we take params[8] to 5.5 and [9] to 5.5, but ensuring that they stay within the range. However, the user's note says to use a step size of 1.0 during exploration. So if the current value is 5, adding or subtracting 1.0 would take it to 6 or 4. Let's try that.

So, for example, changing params[8] from 5 to 6 (but that's already tried in some examples, which resulted in lower rewards). Alternatively, changing params[8] to 4. But in that case, maybe the reward would decrease. However, since the user is suggesting exploration, perhaps trying that.

Alternatively, looking at params[7], which is 6 in most cases. Maybe changing that to 5. But again, that might lower the reward.

Alternatively, looking at params[4] and [5], which are around 5.3 to 6. Maybe changing them to 5.5 or 5.0. But again, the previous examples show that 5.3 is already a good value.

Another thought: the current high-performing parameters have params[0] at 6, which is the maximum. Maybe trying to lower that to 5, but that could reduce the reward. However, since the user is suggesting exploration, maybe that's worth trying.

But given that the user's examples already have params[0] at 6 and getting 500, perhaps that's the optimal for that parameter. So maybe the other parameters need to be adjusted.

Wait, the user's note says that if you're below 500, you should explore. But in this case, the current examples are at 500, so maybe it's time to exploit. But the user says that the global optimum is around 500, so maybe the current examples are already at the maximum. However, the user might be expecting a slight improvement.

Alternatively, perhaps the user is suggesting that even if you're at 500, you should still explore to ensure that you're not in a local maximum. So, trying to tweak some parameters by 1.0 step.

For example, taking one of the existing high-performing parameters and changing one of the parameters by 1.0. Let's take the first example:

params[0]:6, params[1]:2.3, params[2]:-5, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:6, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:5, params[9]:5.

Now, let's change params[8] from 5 to 6 (step of +1.0). But that was tried in one of the examples and resulted in 356, which is lower. So that's not good. Alternatively, changing params[8] from 5 to 4. Let's try that. So params[8] becomes 4.0.

Another option: change params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3 (but that's out of range). So can't do that. Alternatively, change it to 4.3. But that might lower the reward.

Alternatively, change params[1] from 2.3 to 3.3. Let's try that. So params[1] becomes 3.3. That's a step of +1.0. But will that help?

Alternatively, change params[2] from -5 to -6 (step of -1.0). But in the examples, when params[2] was -6, the reward was 428.75, which is lower than 500. So that's worse.

Hmm. So maybe the best approach is to take one of the existing parameters and tweak one of the other parameters that haven't been changed much. For example, params[8] and [9] are at 5. Maybe changing one of them to 5.5 or 4.5. But since the step size is 1.0, maybe 5.5 is not allowed (since 5.5 is 0.5 away from 5). Wait, the user said that the step size during exploration is 1.0, but the parameters are in increments of 0.1. So maybe the step is 1.0 in the parameter value. For example, changing a parameter from 5 to 6 (a step of +1.0) or from 5 to 4 (a step of -1.0).

So, for example, changing params[8] from 5 to 6 (already tried, but gives lower reward), or from 5 to 4. Let's try that. Let's take the first example and change params[8] to 4.0.

So the new params would be:

params[0]:6; params[1]:2.3; params[2]:-5; params[3]:6; params[4]:5.3; params[5]:6; params[6]:-6; params[7]:6; params[8]:4; params[9]:5.

But I need to check if this has been tried before. Looking at the examples, there's one where params[8] was 6 and [9] was 5, which gave 356.00. But changing params[8] to 4 and keeping [9] at 5 hasn't been tried yet. So that's a new parameter set. This might be worth trying.

Alternatively, changing params[9] from 5 to 6 or 4. Let's try changing params[9] to 4.0.

So the new params would be:

params[0]:6; params[1]:2.3; params[2]:-5; params[3]:6; params[4]:5.3; params[5]:6; params[6]:-6; params[7]:6; params[8]:5; params[9]:4.

Again, this hasn't been tried before.

Alternatively, changing params[7] from 6 to 5.0. Let's see:

params[0]:6; params[1]:2.3; params[2]:-5; params[3]:6; params[4]:5.3; params[5]:6; params[6]:-6; params[7]:5; params[8]:5; params[9]:5.

This might be a new parameter set.

But since the user is suggesting exploration with step size of 1.0, perhaps trying one of these. Let's pick one of them. For example, changing params[8] to 4.0.

Another option: changing params[6] from -6 to -5.0. Let's try that:

params[0]:6; params[1]:2.3; params[2]:-5; params[3]:6; params[4]:5.3; params[5]:6; params[6]:-5; params[7]:6; params[8]:5; params[9]:5.

This hasn't been tried before. Maybe that's a good candidate.

But how to decide which parameter to change? Since the user's note says to explore both positive and negative, maybe trying to change params[6] from -6 to -5.0, which is a step of +1.0.

Alternatively, changing params[6] to -7.0, but that's out of range. So can't do that.

So, the possible options are to change some parameters by +1.0 or -1.0, ensuring they stay within [-6,6].

Another parameter that could be changed is params[3], which is 6 in most cases. Maybe changing it to 5.0.

So, changing params[3] from 6 to 5.0:

params[0]:6; params[1]:2.3; params[2]:-5; params[3]:5; params[4]:5.3; params[5]:6; params[6]:-6; params[7]:6; params[8]:5; params[9]:5.

This might be a new parameter set.

But again, without knowing the actual impact, it's hard to tell. However, since the user is suggesting exploration, perhaps trying one of these.

In conclusion, I'll choose to change params[8] from 5 to 4.0, creating a new parameter set that hasn't been tried before.
