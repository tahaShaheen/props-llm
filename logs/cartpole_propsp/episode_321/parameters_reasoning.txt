SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.
--- TOP 3 BEST PERFORMING PARAMS ---
params[0]: 6; params[1]: 6; params[2]: -3; params[3]: 6; params[4]: -6; params[5]: 1.8; params[6]: -3.5; params[7]: 4.5; params[8]: -2.5; params[9]: -2.5; f(params): 500.00

params[0]: -6; params[1]: -4.5; params[2]: 3; params[3]: 6; params[4]: -6; params[5]: 1.8; params[6]: -3.5; params[7]: 4.5; params[8]: -2.5; params[9]: -2.5; f(params): 500.00
--- MOST RECENT 3 PARAMS ---
params[0]: 6; params[1]: 6; params[2]: -3.5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: -7; params[5]: 1.8; params[6]: -3.5; params[7]: 4.6; params[8]: -2.4; params[9]: -2.5; f(params): 500.00
params[0]: 6; params[1]: -4.5; params[2]: 3; params[3]: 6; params[4]: -7; params[5]: 1.8; params[6]: -3.5; params[7]: 4.5; params[8]: -2.5; params[9]: -2.5; f(params): 160.10
params[0]: 6; params[1]: -4.5; params[2]: -3; params[3]: 6; params[4]: -6; params[5]: 1.8; params[6]: -3.5; params[7]: 4.5; params[8]: -2.5; params[9]: -2.5; f(params): 270.20


Now you are at iteration 321 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, I need to figure out how to maximize the function f(params) for the cartpole environment. The current setup uses a linear policy with 18 parameters and a reward system that rewards when the pole is upright and the cart is within bounds.

First, looking at the top performing params, they all have high values except params[2], which is negative. This suggests that positive exploration might yield higher rewards, but there are some negatives too. The most recent iterations show variations where sometimes f(params) is around 500 or as low as 160.1.

I should focus on increasing the reward by improving when pole upright and cart within bounds. Also, considering negative params could be useful for other aspects of the problem but might decrease rewards elsewhere.

Perhaps I can adjust parameters that affect velocity or angular position to better stabilize the pole. Since action is either pushing left or right, I need to see how adjusting W and B in the policy affects outcomes.

I'll try increasing some positive params while keeping others high where they contribute positively. For example, increasing W[1] could help with velocity, and maybe increase W[3] for angular velocity. Decreasing negative params like W[2] or B[8] might have a beneficial effect on the reward.

Trying specific values around 6 and -4.5 as seen in the examples might be effective because they provided high rewards before. Adjusting these parameters could either increase or decrease their impact based on how they influence velocity, angular position, etc.

I should also ensure that other params aren't causing issues. Maybe tweak B[8] and B[9] slightly to see if it helps balance the reward without harming others.

After adjusting, I'll test with a few iterations to see how f(params) changes and whether there's room for improvement. If it still hits 500 or higher, that's great; otherwise, I might need further tweaks.
