SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 319 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has provided a bunch of training examples for the CartPole environment with different parameter values and their corresponding episodic rewards. The goal is to find the global optimal policy, which they mention should be around 500. The current iteration is 319 out of 400, so there's still some time left. 

Looking at the examples, most of the top params have a reward of 500.00, which is the maximum possible. However, there are a few with lower rewards. The parameters that achieved 500.00 have some commonalities. For instance, params[0] is 6 in all the top examples, params[1] is 2.3, params[2] is -5, params[3] is 6, params[4] is around 5.3, params[5] is 6, params[6] is -6, params[7] is 6, params[8] and [9] are 5. 

But wait, there are some variations. For example, in one of the top params, params[4] is 5.3, in another it's 5.2, and in another it's 5. So maybe there's a range of values that work here. However, the ones that deviate from these values, like params[2] being -4 or params[4] being 4.3, result in lower rewards. 

The user also mentioned that during exploration, a step size of 1.0 should be used. Since we're at iteration 319, maybe it's time to explore nearby values to see if we can find a better combination. However, the current top params are already achieving the maximum reward. But the user said that the global optimum should be around 500, so maybe there's a way to get even higher? Wait, but the maximum possible reward is 500, as each time step gives +1 and the episode can last up to 500 steps. So if the reward is 500, that's already the maximum. 

But the user says that if we're below 500, we should explore. However, the examples provided have some with 500.00. So perhaps the current top params are already at the maximum. But the user's instruction says that the global optimum should be around 500, so maybe the current examples are already at the optimal. However, the user might want to confirm that there's no higher value. 

Wait, but the user's note says that if you are below 500, that's a local optimum and you should explore. But if you're already at 500, maybe you need to check if there's a way to maintain that or if there are other parameters that can also reach 500. However, since the examples already have multiple params achieving 500, perhaps the current best is already found. 

But the user might want to try perturbing some parameters slightly to see if there's a better combination. For example, maybe changing params[4] from 5.3 to 5.4 or 5.5. However, the parameters are constrained between -6.0 and 6.0 with one decimal place. So possible values could be 5.4, 5.5, etc. 

Alternatively, looking at the parameters that achieved 500.00, they have params[8] and [9] as 5. Maybe adjusting those slightly. But since the user says not to propose previously seen params, we need to find new ones. 

Wait, the user's instruction says that in the response, we should not propose previously seen params. So looking at the examples, the params that have been used already are:

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5; f(params): 500.00

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5; f(params): 500.00

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 5; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5; f(params): 500.00

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.2; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5; f(params): 500.00

So some variations here. For example, in the second example, params[3] is 5 instead of 6, but still gets 500. So maybe there's a range of values that work. However, the user wants to avoid previously seen params. So perhaps changing some of the parameters that are on the edge of the range, like params[3] from 6 to 5.9, or params[4] from 5.3 to 5.4. 

Alternatively, looking at the parameters that are not in the top, like the one where params[6] is -5 instead of -6, which resulted in a lower reward. So maybe adjusting other parameters that are not in the current top. 

But since the user says to explore with a step size of 1.0 during exploration, perhaps trying to change some parameters by +/-1.0. However, the parameters are in the range of -6.0 to 6.0 with one decimal place. So for example, if a parameter is 6, changing it to 5 or 7 (but 7 is out of range). So maybe reducing 6 to 5, or increasing 6 to 5.9. 

But given that the current top params have params[0] at 6, maybe trying to lower it to 5.0. However, that might be a big change. Alternatively, looking for parameters that are near the edge but not yet tried. 

Alternatively, since the current top params are already achieving the maximum reward, maybe the best we can do is to keep those. But the user might want to check other possibilities. 

Wait, but the user's instruction says that if the current value is below 500, explore. Since some of the examples have 500, but others are lower. However, the current iteration is 319, and there are 400 steps. So perhaps there's still room for exploration. 

But the user's note says that the global optimum should be around 500, so if we're already at 500, maybe we can't get any higher. But the user might want to ensure that all possibilities are explored. 

Alternatively, maybe the current parameters are not the only ones that can reach 500. For example, changing some parameters that are not in the current top. For example, if params[8] is 5, maybe changing it to 6.0 or 4.0. But since the user says not to propose previously seen params, and in some examples, params[8] is 5, but in others, it's 6. For example, one of the examples has params[8]: 6 and params[9]:5, which resulted in 356.00. So that's worse. 

So maybe trying to adjust other parameters. For instance, looking at params[7], which in the top examples is 6. Maybe changing it to 5.0 or 7.0 (but 7 is out of range). So 5.0. 

But this is getting complicated. Since the user wants the response in the exact format, and the current best is already at 500, perhaps the best approach is to propose a new parameter set that is similar to the current top but with some small changes, ensuring that they haven't been used before. 

Looking at the previous examples, the ones that achieved 500 have params[4] as 5.3, 5.2, or 5.0. So maybe trying 5.4. Let's check if that's been used. In the examples, I don't see 5.4. So changing params[4] from 5.3 to 5.4. Also, maybe changing params[2] from -5 to -4.9 or -5.1. But need to ensure that the new parameters haven't been used before. 

Alternatively, looking at params[3], which is 6 in most cases. Maybe changing it to 5.9. 

But since the user wants exploration with step size 1.0, maybe changing a parameter by +/-1.0. For example, if a parameter is 6, changing it to 5.0 (since 6 -1 =5). But that's a big change. However, the user said during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So maybe that's acceptable. 

For example, taking one of the top params and changing one parameter by +/-1.0. Let's take the first example: params[0] is 6. Changing params[0] to 5.0 (since 6-1=5). Then, other parameters remain the same. But this might lead to a worse reward. However, it's an exploration step. 

But the user might prefer to try changing a parameter that's not in the current top. For example, if params[6] is -6, changing it to -5.0. 

Alternatively, looking for parameters that are in the middle of the range and not yet explored. 

But this is getting a bit too vague. Since the user has already achieved 500, and the instruction says that if you are below 500, explore. But if you are at 500, maybe you can just stick with that. However, the user might want to ensure that there's no higher value. But since 500 is the maximum, that's not possible. 

So perhaps the best action is to propose a new parameter set that's similar to the current top but with some small changes. For example, taking the first example and changing params[4] from 5.3 to 5.4, and params[8] from 5 to 5.1. Ensuring that this hasn't been used before. 

But I need to make sure that the parameters haven't been used in previous examples. Looking back, the examples have params[4] as 5.3, 5.2, 5.0. So 5.4 is new. Similarly, changing params[8] to 5.1. 

So the new parameter set would be: 

params[0]:6, params[1]:2.3, params[2]:-5, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.4, params[5]:6, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:5.1, params[9]:5. 

This hasn't been used before, so it's a new set. 

Alternatively, changing params[7] from 6 to 5.0. 

But without knowing the exact effect, it's hard to say. However, the user wants exploration. 

So, the final answer would be to propose such a parameter set. 

But since the user wants the response in the format of the parameters, I'll proceed with that.
