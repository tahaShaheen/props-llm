SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 253 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has provided a bunch of previous parameter sets and their corresponding rewards. The goal is to find the optimal parameters that maximize the episodic reward, aiming for around 500. The current iteration is 253 out of 400, so there's still room for exploration.

Looking at the examples, the top ones have rewards around 500. The first few entries have params[0] at 6, params[1] around 2.3, params[2] at -5, params[3] at 6, params[4] around 5.3, params[5] at 6, params[6] at -6, params[7] at 6, and params[8] and [9] around 5. Some of these have slight variations, like params[4] being 5 or 5.3, or params[6] being -5 or -6, but the rewards are close to 500.

Now, the user is at iteration 253, and the instruction says to explore if below 500. But the current best is already at 500. However, the note says that the global optimum should be around 500, so maybe there's a way to tweak the parameters to get even higher. Wait, but the examples given already have 500.00. Maybe the user is at a local optimum and needs to explore more.

But the problem is that the user says "if you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting." However, the current best is already at 500. But the user might be referring to the fact that the global maximum is around 500, but there could be slight variations. However, the examples show that some parameters have 500.00, so maybe that's the maximum possible.

Wait, but the user's note says "the global optimum should be around 500." So maybe the maximum is 500, and the examples already have that. Therefore, perhaps the current best is already at the optimal. However, the user might need to check if there are other parameters that can reach 500. But the examples show that some parameter sets have 500.00, so maybe that's the maximum.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to tweak the parameters to get slightly higher. But given that the examples already have 500.00, perhaps that's the maximum. However, the user's instruction says to explore if below 500. Since the current best is at 500, maybe we can try to perturb the parameters slightly to see if we can maintain or improve the reward.

Looking at the parameters that achieved 500.00, they have params[0] at 6, params[1] at 2.3, params[2] at -5, params[3] at 6, params[4] at 5.3, params[5] at 6, params[6] at -6, params[7] at 6, params[8] and [9] at 5. Maybe changing some of these slightly could help. For example, params[4] is 5.3, maybe increasing it to 5.4 or decreasing to 5.2. But since the parameters are in increments of 0.1, we can try that.

But the user also says that during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. Wait, the step size is for exploration. So if we're in the exploration phase, we need to make larger changes. However, the current parameters are already at the maximum reward, so perhaps it's time to explore other regions.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants to continue exploring even if we're at 500, to ensure that we're not missing a better solution. But the examples already have 500.00, so maybe that's the best possible. However, the user's note says that the global optimum should be around 500, so maybe that's the target.

But given that the user is at iteration 253, and there are 400 steps, perhaps there's still room to explore. However, the previous examples have already reached 500.00. So maybe the next step is to check if there are any parameters that can be adjusted to maintain or improve the reward. For example, looking at params[8] and [9], which are at 5. Maybe increasing them to 6 or decreasing to 4. But since the previous examples with params[8] and [9] at 5 achieved 500, maybe that's optimal.

Alternatively, perhaps changing some other parameters. For instance, params[2] is at -5. If we change it to -4 or -6, but the examples with -5 achieved higher rewards. So maybe that's the right value.

Alternatively, looking at the other parameters. For example, params[1] is at 2.3. Maybe trying 1.3 or 3.3. But in the examples, when params[1] was 3.3, the reward was lower (385.35), so that's worse. When it was 1.3, the reward was 497.35, which is slightly lower than 500. So 2.3 seems better.

So, given that, the parameters that achieved 500.00 are already optimal. But the user's instruction says to explore if below 500. Since we're at 500, maybe we should stop. However, the user might want to continue exploring to ensure that there's no higher value. But given the information, 500 is the maximum observed.

But the user's note says that the global optimum should be around 500, so maybe that's the target. Therefore, perhaps the current parameters are already optimal. However, the user might want to check if there are other combinations that can reach the same or higher reward. But since the examples already have 500.00, maybe that's the best possible.

In that case, the next step is to propose a parameter set that's similar to the ones that achieved 500.00, but with slight variations to explore. However, the user's instruction says not to propose previously seen params. So we need to find a new set of parameters that's not in the examples.

Looking at the examples, the ones with 500.00 have params[0] at 6, params[1] at 2.3, params[2] at -5, params[3] at 6, params[4] at 5.3, params[5] at 6, params[6] at -6, params[7] at 6, params[8] at 5, params[9] at 5. So to avoid repetition, maybe change one parameter slightly. For example, increase params[4] from 5.3 to 5.4, or decrease to 5.2. Or change params[8] from 5 to 5.1 or 4.9.

But since the step size during exploration is 1.0, maybe we need to make larger changes. However, the parameters are in increments of 0.1. So, for example, changing params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3 (adding 1.0) or to 4.3 (subtracting 1.0). But that might be too drastic. Alternatively, maybe change one parameter by 1.0 step, like changing params[8] from 5 to 6 (adding 1.0) or to 4 (subtracting 1.0).

But the user's instruction says to use a step size of 1.0 during exploration. So, for example, if we take the parameters that achieved 500.00 and change one parameter by +1.0 or -1.0. Let's pick params[8], which is 5. Changing it to 6 (5 + 1.0) or 4 (5 - 1.0). Let's try 6. So the new params would be:

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 2.3, params[2]: -5, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 5.3, params[5]: 6, params[6]: -6, params[7]: 6, params[8]: 6, params[9]: 5.

But looking at the examples, there's one where params[8] is 6 and params[9] is 5, but that had a reward of 341.20, which is lower. So that's worse. Alternatively, changing params[9] from 5 to 6. Let's try that:

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 2.3, params[2]: -5, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 5.3, params[5]: 6, params[6]: -6, params[7]: 6, params[8]: 5, params[9]: 6.

But in the examples, when params[9] was 6, the reward was lower. So that might not be good. Alternatively, changing another parameter. For example, params[6] is -6. Maybe changing it to -5 (adding 1.0). Let's try that:

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 2.3, params[2]: -5, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 5.3, params[5]: 6, params[6]: -5, params[7]: 6, params[8]: 5, params[9]: 5.

Looking at the examples, there's a set where params[6] was -5 and the reward was 498.55, which is lower than 500. So that's worse. So changing that might not be good.

Alternatively, changing params[2] from -5 to -4 (adding 1.0). Let's try that:

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 2.3, params[2]: -4, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 5.3, params[5]: 6, params[6]: -6, params[7]: 6, params[8]: 5, params[9]: 5.

In the examples, this was tried and had a reward of 499.95, which is slightly lower than 500. So that's not better.

Alternatively, changing params[7] from 6 to 5 (subtracting 1.0). Let's try that:

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 2.3, params[2]: -5, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 5.3, params[5]: 6, params[6]: -6, params[7]: 5, params[8]: 5, params[9]: 5.

In the examples, this had a reward of 479.45, which is worse.

Hmm. So changing any of the parameters by 1.0 seemsأخبار to lower the reward. Therefore, perhaps the current parameters are already optimal. But the user's instruction says to explore even if we're at 500. So maybe we need to try another combination that's not in the examples.

Alternatively, changing multiple parameters slightly. For example, increasing params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3 (adding 1.0) and decreasing params[8] from 5 to 4 (subtracting 1.0). But that might be too drastic. Alternatively, making small changes in multiple parameters.

But given the step size of 1.0, maybe the user expects larger changes. However, since the parameters are in 0.1 increments, a step of 1.0 would be a change of 10 units. That seems too large. Maybe the step size is 0.1, but the user's instruction says during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. That might be a misunderstanding. Perhaps the step size is 1.0 in terms of the parameter's value, but given the parameters are in 0.1 increments, that would be a large change.

Alternatively, maybe the user means to use a step size of 1.0 in the parameter's value, but that's not practical. For example, changing a parameter from 5 to 6 (adding 1.0). That would be a step of 1.0. So that's acceptable.

But in that case, the previous attempts showed that changing parameters by 1.0 leads to lower rewards. Therefore, perhaps the current parameters are already optimal, and further exploration is not needed. However, the user's instruction says to explore even if we're at 500.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants to try a different combination that's not in the examples. For example, changing params[1] from 2.3 to 3.3 (adding 1.0). Let's try that:

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 3.3, params[2]: -5, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 5.3, params[5]: 6, params[6]: -6, params[7]: 6, params[8]: 5, params[9]: 5.

In the examples, this had a reward of 385.35, which is worse. So that's not good.

Alternatively, changing params[0] from 6 to 7 (adding 1.0):

params[0]: 7, params[1]: 2.3, params[2]: -5, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 5.3, params[5]: 6, params[6]: -6, params[7]: 6, params[8]: 5, params[9]: 5.

But that's a large change, and we don't know the result. However, since the user's instruction is to explore, maybe we should try this.

But without knowing the outcome, it's risky. However, given that the user wants exploration, perhaps this is the way to go.

Alternatively, changing params[2] from -5 to -6 (subtracting 1.0):

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 2.3, params[2]: -6, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 5.3, params[5]: 6, params[6]: -6, params[7]: 6, params[8]: 5, params[9]: 5.

But in the examples, there's no such parameter set, and we don't know the reward. However, this is a valid exploration step.

But since the user's instruction is to explore, and the current parameters are already at the maximum observed reward, perhaps this is the way to go.

However, given that the user's note says the global optimum is around 500, and the current parameters achieve that, perhaps it's best to stick with them. But the user's instruction says not to propose previously seen params. So we need to find a new set.

Another approach is to slightly perturb one parameter. For example, changing params[4] from 5.3 to 5.4 (adding 0.1). But this is not a step of 1.0. However, the user's instruction says during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So that might not be allowed.

Alternatively, if the step size is 1.0, then changing params[4] by 1.0 would be from 5.3 to 6.3 or 4.3. But that's a large change.

Given the uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to propose a new parameter set that's similar to the ones that achieved 500.00 but with one parameter changed by 1.0, even if it might lower the reward. For example, changing params[8] from 5 to 6 (adding 1.0), even though in the examples that led to lower rewards. But since we need to explore, this is necessary.

So the new parameter set would be:

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 2.3, params[2]: -5, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 5.3, params[5]: 6, params[6]: -6, params[7]: 6, params[8]: 6, params[9]: 5.

But this is already in the examples and had a reward of 341.20, which is worse. So we need to avoid that.

Alternatively, changing params[9] from 5 to 6:

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 2.3, params[2]: -5, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 5.3, params[5]: 6, params[6]: -6, params[7]: 6, params[8]: 5, params[9]: 6.

This is not in the examples, so it's a new set. Let's propose this.
</think>

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 2.3, params[2]: -5, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 5.3, params[5]: 6, params[6]: -6, params[7]: 6, params[8]: 5, params[9]: 6
