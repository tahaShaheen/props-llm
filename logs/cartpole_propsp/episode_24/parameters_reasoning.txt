SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help this cartpole environment problem where we're looking for a global optimal policy. The user mentioned that the current policy they're using has an average reward of around 47.35 and that's pretty low. They want to improve this by exploring parameters beyond their previous values.

First, I need to understand the problem better. The cartpole environment is a classic RL problem where we have to balance a pole on a cart without it slipping. The state consists of four elements: position, velocity, angle, and angular velocity. Our action space is two actions: push left (0) or push right (1).

The policy they're using is linear, meaning the action is a linear combination of the state vector multiplied by weights and then adding bias terms. The reward is +1 for every time step where the pole is upright and the cart is within bounds. The episode ends if the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

They mentioned that the global optimum should be around 500, which suggests it's a high reward problem. So, they need to find parameters that maximize the episodic reward f(params).

In their exploration phase, we've seen some params and the corresponding rewards. For example, when params[0] is -4.8, params[1] is 6.6, etc., the reward is around 54.10. These seem to be better than the current policy's average of about 47.35.

I need to propose new params that will likely yield a higher reward. Since they're using a linear policy with 18 parameters (9 weights and 9 biases), I can think about adjusting each parameter slightly. Maybe increasing some positive coefficients where beneficial, decreasing others, or adjusting the intercepts could help balance the pole better.

But without knowing exactly which parameters affect performance more, it's hard to say. However, following their example, perhaps tweaking certain parameters like params[0], [1], and [3] in specific directions might improve things. Alternatively, maybe some negative adjustments could be beneficial if they are currently too positive or vice versa.

I should remember that exploration is important here, even though I'm just improving from a point where the reward is lower than global optimum. So, I'll propose a few slightly adjusted parameters to see how it performs in the next iteration.

Maybe something like params[0]: -4.8, [1]: 6.6; [2]: 3.7; [3]: 0.7; [4]: -2.7; [5]: -1.7; [6]: -4; [7]: 2.4; [8]: 2.8; [9]: -1.8. This is a random attempt, but it's worth trying because even slight improvements might tip the balance towards higher rewards.
