SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

params[0]: -3.6; params[1]: 2.8; params[2]: 4.7; params[3]: -5.6; params[4]: -0.8; params[5]: -3.9; params[6]: 0.7; params[7]: 3.2; params[8]: 1.9; params[9]: 2.8; f(params): 34.15
params[0]: -3.6; params[1]: 2.8; params[2]: 4.7; params[3]: -5.6; params[4]: -0.8; params[5]: -3.9; params[6]: 0.7; params[7]: 3.2; params[8]: 1.9; params[9]: 2.8; f(params): 34.15


Now you are at iteration 24 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.

<think>
Okay, I'm looking at this problem where I need to find the global optimal policy for the cartpole environment using an optimization method. The user provided several examples of parameters and their corresponding rewards, which are the episodic rewards f(params). My goal is to use these examples to make educated guesses about what params values would maximize f(params).

First, let me understand the structure of the parameters. They're 10 float numbers arranged in a matrix with 4 rows (CartPosition, CartVelocity, PoleAngle, PoleVelocity) and 2 columns (W and B). The reward is +1 every time step the pole is upright and cart is within bounds.

Looking at the examples given, I see that some params have negative values. For instance, one example has params[0] = -3.6, [8] = 2.8, etc., with a reward of 88.35. Another example has all positive params except for two negatives, giving a lower reward.

I notice that in the first example, some parameters are negative and others are positive, which resulted in a higher reward. The second example where all are positive (except maybe [9]) gave the lowest reward of 39.15. That suggests that different combinations can lead to varying rewards, with some being better than others.

Since the global optimum is around 500, and exploration step size is small, I need to use these examples to find a params array that could potentially give a higher reward than the current ones. It's important not to just look for lower values but maybe identify key parameters that are positive where beneficial.

Looking at each parameter position in the examples:

- params[0]: In two cases it's -3.6, in others, like 2.4 or 1.2, and even negative again. So I need a params[0] value that is likely to give a good reward when pushed towards balance.

- params[1]: Many are positive, sometimes around 2.8 or higher, but some are negative (like -3.6, -5.4). It's unclear if this parameter has a significant impact on the reward beyond its current state.

- params[2]: Most values are high positive, except one at -5.4 and another at 0.8. It seems like this could be crucial for stabilizing the pole.

- params[3]: Usually around -5.6 or higher. This might influence how fast the cart is pushed, affecting whether it can reach within bounds without tipping the pole over.

- params[4]: Typically positive but can go low (like 0.4 to -0.8). It's important for cart velocity control.

- params[5]: Can be very negative or small. This might affect balancing the pole quickly if pushed too much.

- params[6]: Usually in a moderate range, sometimes higher. This is about the angle of the pole.

- params[7]: Many are positive but can go up to 4.7. This likely affects torque applied to the cart (B parameter).

- params[8]: Varies widely from -0.3 to 6.0, and even negative again. It's a big impact on reward when at higher values.

- params[9]: Similar to [8], can be very high or negative but mostly positive in other cases.

Given the examples provided, I see that parameters around 1.2, 2.4, 2.8, and 6 seem to be consistently giving good rewards (like 53.00, 46.00, etc.). However, some are pushing them further but still not surpassing these points.

The current best example has params around -3.6 or higher for [0] through [9], which gave a reward of about 88.35. That's significantly better than the lower rewards. So perhaps I need to look for parameters that can push the reward above this, but without going too high in certain parameters that might not be beneficial.

I'm thinking that params[2] is crucial because in some examples it's -5.4 or 0.8, which is quite different from others. Perhaps increasing [2] would help stabilize the pole if it's pushing it over.

Also, looking at params[7], sometimes it's up to 3.2 and other times negative. Maybe making it more positive than some examples could improve things, but I need to see how it affects the reward.

I'm also thinking about params[8] because in several cases it's around -0.3 or higher. It might be a key parameter for torque control on the cart.

So, putting this together, I would guess parameters that are not too low but within a reasonable range where they can help balance the pole without causing instability. Maybe around 1.2 to 3.2 for some parameters and -5.4 or lower for others.
