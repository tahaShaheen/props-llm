SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 270 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to get the global optimal policy for this cartpole environment. The problem says that the current parameter set gives a reward of 500, which is pretty high. But I want to see if there's a way to improve it further.

I remember that the reward function adds +1 every time step when the pole is upright and the cart is within bounds. So, getting both those things right seems crucial. Maybe if I tweak the parameters where the rewards are based, I can make the pole stay upright longer or push the cart more smoothly.

Looking at the current parameter values: [6, 6, -3, 6, -6, 1.8, -3.5, 4.5, -2.5, -2.5]. The reward here is 500, which is good. But perhaps tweaking the pole angle and velocity parameters could help. For example, if I increase params[6] (pole angle) or adjust other parts, it might stabilize the pole better.

I also notice that in some of the top performing param sets, like [6, 6, -3.5, 6, -6, 1.8, -3.5, 4.5, -2.5, -2.5], the reward is around 493.90, which is slightly less than 500 but still high. Maybe these have a different balance between pole angle and cart control.

Another thing to consider is whether using an action that adjusts both left and right could help in balancing the pole better. The current policy uses linear weights, so perhaps changing how the actions are combined could lead to more effective control.

I should also check if increasing some parameters where they affect the velocity or angular velocities could help reduce the cart's movement too much, which might cause it to fall beyond the bounds.

Additionally, maybe exploring different ranges for some of these parameters could yield better results. For instance, if params[8] is the angular velocity parameter, lowering it a bit might allow the pole to stay upright for longer without making the cart move too fast or causing instability in the bounds.

I also wonder about the exploration vs exploitation aspect mentioned. While the current policy uses all parameters equally during training (exploration), maybe adjusting the weight of some parameters more heavily on exploration would lead to better results, balancing between trying new parameter values and exploiting already good ones.

Overall, it seems like tweaking specific parameters related to pole angle, velocity, and cart control could help improve the reward. I should try changing these a bit while keeping others the same and see if the reward increases beyond 500.
