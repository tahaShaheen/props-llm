SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 68 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of previous parameter sets and their corresponding rewards. The goal is to find the optimal parameters that maximize the episodic reward, aiming for around 500. The current iteration is 68, and there are 400 steps left. 

First, I need to look at the top-performing parameters. The highest reward so far is 428.05 with params[0] to [9] set as 6, 1.3, -3, 6, 5.3, 2.7, -6, 6, 6, 6. Then there's another one with 426.55, which is very close. The next ones are lower, like 413.65 and 404.95. 

Looking at these, the first one has params[0] and [3] at 6, [2] at -3, [4] at 5.3, [5] at 2.7, [6] at -6, [7] at 6, and the bias terms [8] and [9] at 6. The next one changes [5] to 3.7 but lowers the reward slightly. 

Since the user mentioned that the global optimum should be around 500, and the current best is 428, there's room for improvement. The user also said to explore both positive and negative values with a step size of 1.0 during exploration. 

Looking at the parameters, maybe tweaking some of the values that are on the edge of the range. For example, params[0] and [3] are at 6, which is the maximum. Maybe reducing them a bit could help. Similarly, params[2] is at -3; perhaps increasing it to -2 or even -1. Also, the bias terms are at 6. Maybe lowering them slightly. 

Another thing to note is that in the top examples, params[4] and [5] are around 5.3 and 2.7. Maybe adjusting those. Also, params[6] is -6, which is the minimum. Could increasing that to -5 or -4 help? 

But since the user wants exploration with a step size of 1.0, I should consider making changes of 1.0 to some parameters. For instance, taking the top parameter set and modifying one or two parameters by +/-1.0. Let's pick params[2] which is -3. If I increase it by 1.0 to -2, that's within the range. Also, maybe adjusting params[5] from 2.7 to 3.7 (as in one of the examples) but that was lower. Alternatively, maybe changing params[7] from 6 to 5. 

Wait, but the user said not to propose previously seen params. So I need to make sure that the new parameters haven't been tried before. Looking at the examples, the first one has params[0] at 6, [1] at 1.3, [2] at -3, [3] at 6, [4] at 5.3, [5] at 2.7, [6] at -6, [7] at 6, [8] at 6, [9] at 6. 

If I change params[2] from -3 to -2 (increase by 1), and maybe adjust params[5] from 2.7 to 3.7, but that might have been tried. Alternatively, change params[6] from -6 to -5. 

Alternatively, try changing params[0] from 6 to 5, but that might be too much. Wait, the step size is 1.0, so maybe changing one parameter by +/-1.0. Let's try changing params[2] from -3 to -2 (increase by 1), and keep others the same. That would be a new parameter set. 

Alternatively, change params[6] from -6 to -5. Let me check if that's been done. In one of the examples, params[6] was -5. So maybe that's already tried. 

Alternatively, change params[7] from 6 to 5. That's a new set. Let's try that. 

Another approach: look for parameters that are at the extremes and adjust them. For example, params[0] is 6, so maybe reducing it to 5. Similarly, params[3] is 6, maybe reduce to 5. But that might lower the reward. However, since we need to explore, maybe that's necessary. 

Alternatively, change the bias terms. The current bias terms are 6 and 6. Maybe reducing them to 5. 

But the user said to use a step size of 1.0 during exploration. So, for example, take the top parameter set and change one parameter by +1.0 or -1.0. Let's pick params[2] (-3) and increase it to -2. That's a step of +1.0. So the new params would be:

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 1.3; params[2]: -2; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 2.7; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 6; params[9]: 6. 

Wait, but that's similar to one of the previous examples (the fourth one with 404.95). So that might have been tried already. Therefore, I need to avoid that. 

Another parameter to adjust: params[4] is 5.3. Maybe increase it to 6.3? But the maximum is 6.0. So can't. Or decrease to 4.3. 

Alternatively, params[5] is 2.7. Maybe increase to 3.7 or decrease to 1.7. 

But looking at the examples, changing params[5] to 3.7 gave a lower reward. So maybe decreasing it. 

Alternatively, change params[7] from 6 to 5. Let's try that. So the new params would be:

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 1.3; params[2]: -3; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 2.7; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 5; params[8]: 6; params[9]: 6. 

This hasn't been tried in the examples provided. Let's check the previous examples. The 14th example had params[7] at 5, but the rest were different. So this might be a new set. 

Another option: change params[8] or [9] from 6 to 5. Let's say params[8] to 5. 

So, params[0]:6, [1]:1.3, [2]:-3, [3]:6, [4]:5.3, [5]:2.7, [6]:-6, [7]:6, [8]:5, [9]:6. 

This is a new set. 

Alternatively, adjust multiple parameters. For example, decrease params[0] from 6 to 5, increase params[2] from -3 to -2, and decrease params[7] from 6 to 5. 

But that's multiple changes. However, since we're in exploration phase, maybe trying one change at a time. 

So, the best bet is to pick a parameter that's at the edge and adjust it by 1.0. For example, params[6] is -6, which is the minimum. Maybe increasing it to -5. Let's try that. 

So, new params: 

params[0]:6; params[1]:1.3; params[2]:-3; params[3]:6; params[4]:5.3; params[5]:2.7; params[6]:-5; params[7]:6; params[8]:6; params[9]:6. 

This is similar to one of the examples (the 7th one with f=398.00). So that's already tried. 

Hmm. Maybe changing params[5] from 2.7 to 3.7 (but that was tried and gave lower reward). Not helpful. 

Alternatively, change params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3, but that's over the maximum. So can't. 

Alternatively, change params[3] from 6 to 5. Let's try that. 

params[0]:6; params[1]:1.3; params[2]:-3; params[3]:5; params[4]:5.3; params[5]:2.7; params[6]:-6; params[7]:6; params[8]:6; params[9]:6. 

This is similar to the 5th example (params[3] at 5, but others are different). So maybe that's a new set. 

But I need to ensure that this hasn't been tried before. Looking through the examples, I don't see that exact combination. So that might be a viable candidate. 

Alternatively, change params[2] from -3 to -4 (but that's below the minimum of -6? Wait, the parameters can be from -6 to 6? Wait, the user didn't specify the range, but the examples have parameters like -6 and 6. So maybe the parameters can be between -6 and 6. So changing params[2] from -3 to -4 is allowed. 

But that's a step of -1.0. Let's try that. 

params[0]:6; params[1]:1.3; params[2]:-4; params[3]:6; params[4]:5.3; params[5]:2.7; params[6]:-6; params[7]:6; params[8]:6; params[9]:6. 

This is a new set. 

But I'm not sure if that's the best direction. Alternatively, maybe adjusting the bias terms. 

Another approach: look for parameters that are not at the extremes. For example, params[1] is 1.3. Maybe increasing it to 2.3 or decreasing to 0.3. 

But again, need to check if that's been tried. 

Alternatively, since the user said to explore with step size 1.0, perhaps take the top parameter set and change one parameter by +1.0 or -1.0. Let's pick params[2] (-3) and increase it to -2. But that was tried in the 4th example. So that's not allowed. 

Alternatively, change params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3 (invalid), or to 4.3. Let's try 4.3. 

params[0]:6; params[1]:1.3; params[2]:-3; params[3]:6; params[4]:4.3; params[5]:2.7; params[6]:-6; params[7]:6; params[8]:6; params[9]:6. 

This is a new set. 

Alternatively, change params[5] from 2.7 to 3.7 (but that was tried and gave lower reward). 

Hmm. It's challenging to find a new set that hasn't been tried. Maybe looking for parameters that are in the middle. For example, params[1] is 1.3. Maybe changing that to 2.3. 

params[0]:6; params[1]:2.3; params[2]:-3; params[3]:6; params[4]:5.3; params[5]:2.7; params[6]:-6; params[7]:6; params[8]:6; params[9]:6. 

This is a new set. 

Alternatively, change params[1] to 0.3. 

But I need to make sure that this is a new parameter set. 

Given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to take the top parameter set and adjust one parameter that hasn't been changed much. For example, params[7] is at 6. Maybe reducing it to 5. 

So, the new set would be:

params[0]:6; params[1]:1.3; params[2]:-3; params[3]:6; params[4]:5.3; params[5]:2.7; params[6]:-6; params[7]:5; params[8]:6; params[9]:6. 

This hasn't been tried in the examples provided. Let me check the previous examples. The 7th example had params[7] at 5, but others were different. So this is a new set. 

Alternatively, change params[8] from 6 to 5. 

params[0]:6; params[1]:1.3; params[2]:-3; params[3]:6; params[4]:5.3; params[5]:2.7; params[6]:-6; params[7]:6; params[8]:5; params[9]:6. 

This is also a new set. 

Since the user wants exploration, either of these changes could be tried. I'll go with changing params[7] from 6 to 5. That seems like a reasonable step.

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 1.3, params[2]: -3, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 5.3, params[5]: 2.7, params[6]: -6, params[7]: 5, params[8]: 6, params[9]: 6
