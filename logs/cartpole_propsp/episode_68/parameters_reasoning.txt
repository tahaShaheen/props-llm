SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help this cartpole environment where the policy is a linear one with 18 parameters. The goal is to find the global optimal parameters that maximize the episodic reward. The user mentioned that the global optimum should be around 500 rewards, and if we don't reach that, we can explore instead of exploit.

First, I remember that in policy gradient methods like this, the policy's parameters are updated based on the average gradient of the rewards with respect to those parameters across all trajectories. So, each time we sample a trajectory (each episode), we compute the derivative of the reward with respect to W and B, then update the weights.

Looking at the provided examples, some parameters have values ranging from -6.0 to 6.0. The best performing parameters so far include ones like params[0] = 5.7, params[2] = -1.8, etc., all around that range. So I should aim for similar or higher values within this range.

But how do we systematically find the optimal point? Maybe we can use some form of grid search or gradient ascent with careful exploration. Since it's a function from 10 parameters to a reward, perhaps using asynchronous sampling where each parameter is updated every certain number of steps. That way, we gather enough information before updating.

Another thought: maybe combining multiple trajectories by running the policy multiple times on different initial states would help in finding a more stable point. Each run (trajectory) could contribute differently to the gradient calculation, so averaging or aggregating the results from all runs might give a better estimate of the optimal parameters.

Also, considering that each parameter is updated simultaneously, perhaps using a small batch size for gradient estimation would make the updates less noisy and easier to converge. Maybe updating each parameter every 10 steps instead of all at once could balance exploration and convergence.

I should also think about how to handle the episodes. Each time we run an episode, that's considered one sample from the policy distribution. So using a small batch size for gradient estimation would allow us to get better estimates of the average gradient, which is what matters for updating our parameters.

Moreover, since the reward function rewards balanced poles and keeps cart within bounds, having parameters that push the pole up (like params[3] = -0.7) could be beneficial in balancing. Similarly, keeping the cart within range might require parameters to move more gently, perhaps pushing the left (-1.8 for params[4]) or right (+1.1 for params[5]).

But without a clear direction, it's hard to say exactly which parameters should be adjusted up or down. It might require some experimentation with multiple trajectories and careful parameter updates to see where the reward increases the most.

Also, in terms of implementation, ensuring that each gradient sample is correctly calculated and averaged could prevent drift in our parameter estimates. Maybe using a moving average approach for the gradients would help maintain stability during training.

I wonder if using techniques from reinforcement learning like PPO or A2C, which are designed to handle complex environments with high-dimensional states, might offer better guidance here. But since this is a simple linear policy, perhaps starting with vanilla policy gradient and adjusting parameters incrementally based on the reward would be more straightforward.

Another angle is to use an exploration-exploitation balance in parameter updates. Sometimes, using adaptive step sizes or random perturbations can help escape local optima by encouraging the search space to expand beyond just following gradients.

I should also consider that each parameter's gradient contribution depends on all other parameters due to the linear nature of W and B. So a systematic way to calculate how each individual parameter affects the reward is crucial, ensuring that we capture both direct and indirect effects through their interactions.

Maybe setting up an iterative approach where for each iteration, I run multiple episodes (like 10 or more) from different starting states, compute the gradients based on all these samples, and then update each parameter accordingly. This would make the gradient estimate more accurate over time.

Also, thinking about how to evaluate if we've reached convergence: perhaps by tracking the maximum reward across several consecutive iterations and stopping when it stabilizes above a certain threshold (like 500) or after a set number of steps (like 400).

In summary, my strategy would involve:

1. Running multiple episodes from different initial states to gather gradient information.
2. Calculating the average gradient with consideration for each parameter's contribution based on W and B structure.
3. Updating all parameters simultaneously using these gradients.
4. Ensuring that each update is carefully scaled or averaged to reduce noise and avoid instability.

By following this systematic approach, I can incrementally adjust the parameters in a way that maximizes the reward over time, aiming towards the global optimum around 500 steps.
