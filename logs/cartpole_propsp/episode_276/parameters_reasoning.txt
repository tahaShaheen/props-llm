SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 276 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has provided a bunch of training examples for the CartPole environment with different parameter values and their corresponding episodic rewards. The goal is to find the global optimal policy, which they mention should be around 500. The current iteration is 276 out of 400, so there's still some time left for exploration.

Looking at the examples, the highest rewards are around 500. The top examples have params[0] at 6, params[1] around 2.3, params[2] around -5, params[3] at 6, params[4] around 5.3, params[5] at 6, params[6] at -6, params[7] around 6, and params[8] and [9] around 5. However, some variations in these parameters lead to lower rewards. For instance, changing params[2] to -4 or -6 reduces the reward. Similarly, changing params[7] from 6 to 5 also lowers the reward. 

The user mentioned that during exploration, a search step size of 1.0 should be used. Since the current examples are clustered around certain values, maybe we need to perturb some parameters to explore new areas. Let's check which parameters could be adjusted. 

Looking at params[2], which is currently -5 in the top examples. If we increase it by 1.0 to -4, but in some examples that led to lower rewards. Alternatively, maybe decreasing it further to -6? But in one example, that led to a lower reward. However, maybe there's a sweet spot. 

What about params[7]? In some examples, it's 6, others 5. Maybe trying 7? But the range is up to 6.0. Wait, the parameters are in the range [-6.0, 6.0], so 6 is the max. So can't go beyond that. 

Looking at params[8] and [9], which are mostly 5 or 6. In one example, they were 6 and 6, but that led to a lower reward. Maybe adjusting them to 4 or 5.5? But the step size is 1.0, so maybe 4 or 6. 

Alternatively, check other parameters. For example, params[1] is 2.3 in most cases. What if we try 3.3 or 1.3? In one example, params[1] was 1.3, which gave a lower reward. So maybe increasing it further? But the current value is 2.3. 

Another parameter is params[4], which is 5.3. Maybe increasing to 6.3? No, since the max is 6.0. So 6.0 is the upper limit. 

Looking at params[6], which is -6 in most cases. Maybe trying -5? But in some examples, that led to lower rewards. 

Hmm. The key here is to explore parameters that haven't been tried yet but are within the step size. Since the current top examples have params[0] at 6, maybe trying 5 or 7? But 7 is beyond the range. So 5.0. 

Alternatively, check if there are any parameters that haven't been varied much. For example, params[5] is always 6. Maybe trying 5? 

But the user says to explore both positive and negative values. Let's think. Maybe perturb params[2] from -5 to -5 + 1.0 = -4 (already tried, but maybe in a different combination). Or -5 -1.0 = -6 (also tried). 

What about params[8] and [9]? They are mostly 5 or 6. Maybe trying 4 or 7 (but 7 is out of range). So 4.0. 

Alternatively, check if other parameters can be adjusted. For example, params[3] is 6 in most cases. What if we lower it to 5? 

But the step size is 1.0. So perhaps trying to change one parameter by +/-1.0. Let's pick a parameter that hasn't been varied much. For example, params[8] and [9] are 5 or 6. Let's try changing params[8] to 4.0. 

But how to choose which parameter to adjust? Maybe pick one that's in the middle of the range. For example, params[1] is 2.3. Maybe trying 3.3 or 1.3. But 1.3 was tried and gave lower reward. 

Alternatively, looking at the current top examples, maybe the best is to slightly perturb one parameter. For example, in the first example, params[4] is 5.3. What if we increase it to 6.0? Let's try that. 

So, modifying params[4] from 5.3 to 6.0. Let's see what that does. 

So, the new params would be:

params[0]: 6.0
params[1]: 2.3
params[2]: -5.0
params[3]: 6.0
params[4]: 6.0
params[5]: 6.0
params[6]: -6.0
params[7]: 6.0
params[8]: 5.0
params[9]: 5.0

This way, we're increasing params[4] by 0.7, but since the step size is 1.0, maybe that's not a full step. Alternatively, maybe changing params[4] to 6.0 (since it's allowed). 

Alternatively, maybe changing params[7] from 6.0 to 5.0 (but that was tried and gave lower reward). 

Alternatively, check if any parameters are at the extremes. For example, params[0] is 6.0, which is the max. Maybe trying 5.0. 

But the user says to explore both positive and negative values. So perhaps trying to lower some parameters that are at the upper bound. 

Alternatively, check if there's a parameter that's not at the extremes. For example, params[1] is 2.3. Maybe trying 3.3. 

But without knowing the exact function, it's hard to say. However, since the current best is around 500, and the global optimum is supposed to be around 500, maybe we need to explore more. 

Another approach: look for parameters that have not been varied much. For example, params[8] and [9] are mostly 5 or 6. Maybe trying 4.0 for one of them. 

Let's try changing params[8] from 5 to 4.0. 

So, new params would be:

params[0]: 6.0
params[1]: 2.3
params[2]: -5.0
params[3]: 6.0
params[4]: 5.3
params[5]: 6.0
params[6]: -6.0
params[7]: 6.0
params[8]: 4.0
params[9]: 5.0

This is a change of -1.0 in params[8]. 

Alternatively, maybe changing params[9] to 4.0. 

But the user said not to propose previously seen params. Looking back, in one example, params[8] and [9] were 6 and 6, but that gave lower reward. So maybe trying 4.0 for one of them. 

Alternatively, check if there's any parameter that hasn't been varied. For example, params[2] is -5 in most cases. What if we try -5.0 +1.0 = -4.0? But that was tried and gave lower reward. 

Alternatively, maybe changing params[6] from -6.0 to -5.0. But that was tried and gave lower reward. 

Hmm. It's tricky. Since the user wants exploration with step size 1.0, perhaps we need to pick a parameter that's in the middle and adjust it. For example, params[1] is 2.3. Let's try increasing it by 1.0 to 3.3. 

So, new params would be:

params[0]: 6.0
params[1]: 3.3
params[2]: -5.0
params[3]: 6.0
params[4]: 5.3
params[5]: 6.0
params[6]: -6.0
params[7]: 6.0
params[8]: 5.0
params[9]: 5.0

This is a change of +1.0 in params[1]. 

Alternatively, decrease params[1] to 1.3 (but that was tried and gave lower reward). 

Another idea: check if any of the parameters in the current top examples have a value that's not at the extremes. For example, params[4] is 5.3. Maybe trying 6.0. 

So, changing params[4] from 5.3 to 6.0. 

That would be:

params[0]: 6.0
params[1]: 2.3
params[2]: -5.0
params[3]: 6.0
params[4]: 6.0
params[5]: 6.0
params[6]: -6.0
params[7]: 6.0
params[8]: 5.0
params[9]: 5.0

This is a change of +0.7 in params[4]. But the step size is 1.0. Maybe that's not a full step. However, since the current value is 5.3, adding 0.7 to reach 6.0. But maybe that's acceptable. 

Alternatively, since the step size is 1.0, perhaps changing params[4] by +1.0 from 5.3 to 6.3, but that's beyond the max of 6.0. So can't do that. 

So, the best option is to change params[4] to 6.0. 

I think that's a valid exploration step. Let's go with that.

params[0]: 6.0, params[1]: 2.3, params[2]: -5.0, params[3]: 6.0, params[4]: 6.0, params[5]: 6.0, params[6]: -6.0, params[7]: 6.0, params[8]: 5.0, params[9]: 5.0
