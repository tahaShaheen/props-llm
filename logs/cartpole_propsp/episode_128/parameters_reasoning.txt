SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 128 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has given me a bunch of previous parameter sets and their corresponding rewards. My job is to come up with the next set of parameters that might lead to a higher reward. The goal is to reach around 500, which is the global optimum mentioned. 

Looking at the top examples, the highest reward was 497.35 with params where most of the W matrix entries are either 6 or -6, and the B terms are 6. But that's still below 500. The user mentioned that if we're below 500, we should explore instead of exploit. So maybe I need to try varying some parameters more.

The current iteration is 128 out of 400, so there's still a lot of steps left. The exploration step size is 1.0, so I should adjust some parameters by ±1.0 from the current ones. Let's check the previous top params. The first one had params[0] at 6, params[1] at 1.3, params[2] at -6, etc. Maybe I can try changing some of those values. For example, increasing params[1] from 1.3 to 2.3 or decreasing it to 0.3. But I have to make sure not to repeat any previous params.

Looking at the most recent params, the last one had params[0] at 6, params[1] at 2.3, which gave a lower reward. Maybe that's not the direction. The earlier ones with params[1] at 1.3 had higher rewards. So perhaps adjusting other parameters instead. Let's look at the W matrix. The first row is [6, 1.3], maybe changing params[0] to 5 or 7 (but 7 is outside the allowed range of -6 to 6). So maybe 5.0? Or 6.0 is already there. Alternatively, maybe changing params[3] from 6 to 5 or 7, but again 7 is out of range. So maybe 5.0.

Alternatively, looking at the B terms. The B terms are [6, 6]. Maybe adjusting those. But in previous examples, when B terms were lower, like 5, the reward was lower. So maybe keeping them high. But perhaps trying to adjust some of the W parameters that are at the extremes. For example, params[2] is -6. Maybe changing that to -5 or -7 (but again, -7 is out of range). So -5.0. Let's try that.

Another approach: since the exploration step is 1.0, let's take one of the previous high-performing params and perturb one parameter by ±1.0. Let's take the first example with reward 497.35. Let's change params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3 (but 6.3 is over 6.0). So maybe 6.0. Wait, that's already the max. Alternatively, decrease it to 4.3. But that was tried before. Hmm. Maybe changing params[6] from -6 to -5. Let's try that.

Wait, the first example had params[6] at -6. If I change that to -5, maybe that would help. Let me try that. So, params[6] becomes -5 instead of -6. Let's see. So the new params would be:

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 1.3; params[2]: -6; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -5; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 6; params[9]: 6.

But wait, this was already tried in one of the previous examples (the 9th entry) with reward 484.80, which is lower. So that's worse. Hmm. Maybe that's not the way. Let's think of other parameters to adjust.

Looking at the W matrix, maybe the second row. params[2] and params[3] are -6 and 6. Maybe changing params[2] to -5. Let's try that. So params[2] becomes -5. Then, the rest stay the same. Let's check if that's a new param set. Yes, because in previous examples, when params[2] was -5, some had lower rewards, but maybe with other changes.

Alternatively, maybe changing params[4] and params[5]. In the first example, params[4] is 5.3 and params[5] is 6. Maybe increasing params[4] to 6.3 (but that's over 6.0). So can't. Or decreasing to 4.3. But that was tried. Alternatively, changing params[5] from 6 to 5.7, but that was also tried.

Another idea: the B terms. Maybe increasing them further? But they are already at 6.0. Can't go higher. Maybe decreasing them? But that might lower the reward. Not sure.

Alternatively, looking at the other parameters. Let's check the 3rd parameter in the W matrix. params[4] and params[5] are 5.3 and 6. Maybe changing params[4] to 6.0. Let's see. So params[4] becomes 6.0. That would be a change from 5.3 to 6.0. Let's try that. So the new params would be:

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 1.3; params[2]: -6; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 6.0; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 6; params[9]: 6.

But wait, is that a new set? Let me check previous examples. The 12th entry had params[4] as 6, but that had a lower reward. However, maybe combining that with other changes. But I need to ensure that this is a new set. Since the previous example with params[4] as 6 had other parameters different, maybe this is a new set.

Alternatively, maybe changing params[7] from 6 to 5. Let's try that. So params[7] becomes 5.0. Let's see. But that might lower the reward. Not sure.

Another approach: looking for parameters that haven't been explored much. For example, in the W matrix, the first row has params[0] and params[1] as 6 and 1.3. Maybe changing params[1] to 2.3 (as in one of the examples) but that gave lower rewards. Alternatively, maybe changing params[1] to 0.3. Let's try that. So params[1] becomes 0.3. But that's a big change. However, since the user says to explore with step size 1.0, maybe that's allowed. But 1.3 to 0.3 is a change of -1.0. That's acceptable.

So, let's try changing params[1] from 1.3 to 0.3. Then, the new params would be:

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 0.3; params[2]: -6; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 6; params[9]: 6.

But I need to check if this has been tried before. Looking through the examples, I don't see this exact set. So that's a new one. Maybe this could lead to a higher reward. Alternatively, changing other parameters. But I need to pick one to change. Since the user says to explore with step size 1.0, I should pick one parameter and adjust it by ±1.0. Let's pick params[1] and decrease it by 1.0 to 0.3. Let's go with that.
