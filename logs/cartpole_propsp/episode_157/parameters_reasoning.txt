SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking about the cartpole environment and a linear policy they're using. So I need to understand what's happening here.

First, I recall that the cartpole is a classic RL problem where the goal is to balance a pole on a cart without it rolling off. It involves both position and velocity of the cart and the angle and angular velocity of the pole. The reward system is straightforward: +1 every time step if the pole is upright and the cart is within bounds, otherwise 0.

The policy they're using is linear, which means W is a matrix that when multiplied by the state vector gives the action probabilities. Each parameter in W affects how the action is chosen. They mention their reward function f(params) which depends on all these parameters.

Now, the user wants to find the optimal params values. They provided some initial examples and best performing ones. From the TOP 9, they have specific param values and corresponding rewards. The most recent one shows a lower reward than others but it's worth looking into.

I think about how to approach this. Since I'm not training here, I need to guide them on what parameters could be optimal. Parameters include both positive and negative values. They mentioned trying around -5 to 6 with 1 decimal places.

Looking at the best performing params: some are negative like -4.5, others positive but lower than that. So maybe a balance between pushing left and right without overstepping. Also, parameters like B_2 and B_3 being around zero suggest it's not a dominant direction.

I should explain how these values might work together. For instance, if W_0 is high, moving left would help more; similarly for other weights. The best reward suggests finding a balance where the pole doesn't tip too much but also enough to keep it upright.

The user wants specific param values, so I need to suggest some in that range without being too speculative since there's no training data. Maybe around -4.5 for params[0] and [1], then parameters like 2.4 or similar for others to explore the trade-offs.
