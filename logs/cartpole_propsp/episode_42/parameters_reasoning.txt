SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of training examples with different params and their corresponding episodic rewards. The goal is to find the global optimal policy, which should be around 500. The current best in the examples is 398.45, but that's still below 500. So, I need to explore more to find a better solution.

First, looking at the existing params, many of them have high values in W and B. For example, params[0] and params[3] are often 6, and params[8] and params[9] are around 5-6. However, the rewards are still in the 300s. Maybe there's a combination that's not being tried yet.

The user mentioned that during exploration, a search step size of 1.0 should be used. So, I should consider varying the parameters by ±1.0 from the current ones. But I also need to avoid repeating previous params. Let me check the existing examples to see which values are already used.

Looking at the top examples, some params have values like -6, -5, -4, etc., but maybe there's a better combination where some parameters are adjusted. For instance, in the first example, params[2] is -4, but maybe increasing that to -3 or -2 could help? Or perhaps adjusting the bias terms (params 8 and 9) to different values.

Wait, the policy is action = argmax(state @ W + B). So, the weights W and bias B determine the linear combination. To maximize the reward, the policy needs to balance the cart effectively. Maybe the current params are too focused on certain features, like cart position or velocity, and not considering the pole's angle and angular velocity enough.

Looking at the existing params, some have params[6] and params[7] as -6 and 6, which might be contributing to the angular velocity part. But maybe adjusting these could lead to better performance. Also, the bias terms (params 8 and 9) are mostly high, which might be pushing the action towards one side too much.

Since the global optimum is supposed to be around 500, which is higher than the current examples, I need to explore new parameter combinations. Let's think about varying some parameters that haven't been tried much. For example, in the existing examples, params[4] and params[5] (which are part of the pole angle and angular velocity in W) are often around 4-5 and 1-2.7. Maybe increasing params[4] to 6 and adjusting params[5] to a different value could help.

Another thought: the current examples have a lot of 6s and 5s, but maybe introducing some negative values in the W matrix for certain features could help. For example, if the cart's velocity is too high, the policy might need to apply a force in the opposite direction. So, maybe adjusting params[1] (which is part of cart velocity in W) to a negative value could help in some cases.

But the user said to use a search step size of 1.0 during exploration. So, I should take one of the existing params and adjust some parameters by ±1.0. Let's pick one of the higher reward examples, like the first one with 398.45. The params there are:

params[0]:6, params[1]:0.3, params[2]:-4, params[3]:6, params[4]:4.3, params[5]:1.7, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:6, params[9]:6.

Maybe increasing params[4] from 4.3 to 5.3 (adding 1.0) and adjusting params[5] from 1.7 to 2.7. That's similar to another example, but maybe changing other parameters. Alternatively, changing params[2] from -4 to -3 (since that's a step of +1.0). Let's try that.

So, modifying params[2] from -4 to -3, and also increasing params[4] to 5.3 and params[5] to 2.7. Also, maybe adjusting the bias terms. Let's see:

params[0]:6, params[1]:0.3, params[2]:-3, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:2.7, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:5, params[9]:5. That's similar to one of the examples with a reward of 398.00. But maybe that's already been tried. The user says not to propose previously seen params. So, I need to find a new combination.

Alternatively, let's take another example. The second example has params[0]:6, params[1]:1.3, params[2]:-3, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:2.7, params[6]:-5, params[7]:6, params[8]:5, params[9]:5. That gives 398.00. Maybe changing params[6] from -5 to -6, and adjusting others. Let's try:

params[0]:6, params[1]:1.3, params[2]:-3, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:2.7, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:5, params[9]:5. That's a new set. Maybe this could lead to a higher reward.

Alternatively, trying to vary some other parameters. For instance, in the first example, params[8] and params[9] are both 6. Maybe reducing them to 5.3 and 5.3 as in another example. But that's already been tried.

Another approach: look for parameters that are not at the extremes. For example, params[1] is 0.3 in many examples. Maybe trying 1.3 or -0.7. But the user says to use a step size of 1.0 during exploration. So, if the current value is 0.3, adding 1.0 would be 1.3, which is already in some examples. But maybe trying to go further, like 2.3, but that might be out of the range (since the max is 6.0). Wait, the params are in [-6.0, 6.0], so 2.3 is allowed.

But the user's examples don't have that. Maybe trying a new combination where some parameters are adjusted. For example, take the first example and increase params[1] from 0.3 to 1.3, and decrease params[8] and params[9] from 6 to 5. That's similar to the second example, but maybe that's already been tried. Hmm.

Alternatively, let's think about the structure of the policy. The action is determined by the maximum of two linear functions (since it's argmax with two actions). So, the weights W and bias B for each action. Maybe the current examples are not balancing the two actions properly. For example, if the two linear functions are too similar, the policy might not choose the right action. So, adjusting the weights to make one action more favorable in certain states.

But without knowing the exact dynamics, it's hard to say. Maybe trying to vary some parameters that are in the middle. For example, in the first example, params[4] is 4.3. Maybe increasing it to 5.3 (step of +1.0) and adjusting others. Let's try that.

So, let's take the first example and adjust params[4] from 4.3 to 5.3, and params[5] from 1.7 to 2.7. That gives:

params[0]:6, params[1]:0.3, params[2]:-4, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:2.7, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:6, params[9]:6. But this is similar to another example with a reward of 270.30. Wait, no, that example had params[4] as 5.3 and params[5] as 2.7. Maybe that's not the best approach.

Alternatively, let's try varying params[6] and params[7]. In the first example, params[6] is -6 and params[7] is 6. Maybe changing params[6] to -5 and params[7] to 5. But that might not help. Alternatively, keeping params[6] at -6 and increasing params[7] to 7, but that's beyond the allowed range. So, 6 is the max.

Another idea: looking at the existing examples, some have params[8] and params[9] as 5, others as 6. Maybe trying to set them to 5.3 or 5.7. But I need to check if that's allowed. Since the range is up to 6.0, 5.7 is okay.

But without knowing which parameters are critical, it's challenging. Maybe the best approach is to take one of the existing examples and adjust one parameter by +1.0 or -1.0. For example, take the first example (params[0]:6, params[1]:0.3, params[2]:-4, params[3]:6, params[4]:4.3, params[5]:1.7, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:6, params[9]:6) and increase params[4] by 1.0 to 5.3, and decrease params[5] by 1.0 to 0.7. That might be a new combination. Let's see:

params[0]:6, params[1]:0.3, params[2]:-4, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:0.7, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:6, params[9]:6. This is a new set. Maybe this could lead to a higher reward.

Alternatively, changing params[2] from -4 to -3 (adding 1.0) and adjusting other parameters. Let's try:

params[0]:6, params[1]:0.3, params[2]:-3, params[3]:6, params[4]:4.3, params[5]:1.7, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:6, params[9]:6. This is similar to one of the examples with reward 398.00, but maybe that's already been tried.

Hmm, this is tricky. The user wants a new set of parameters that haven't been tried before. Let me check the existing examples again to ensure I don't repeat any.

Looking at the list, the example with params[0]:6, params[1]:0.3, params[2]:-3, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:2.7, params[6]:-5, params[7]:6, params[8]:5, params[9]:5 has a reward of 398.00. So, if I adjust params[6] from -5 to -6, that's a new set. Let's try that:

params[0]:6, params[1]:0.3, params[2]:-3, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:2.7, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:5, params[9]:5. This hasn't been tried yet. Maybe this could be a good candidate.

Alternatively, adjusting params[8] and params[9] to higher values. For example, setting them to 6.0. But in the first example, they are already 6.0. So that's already been tried.

Another possibility: changing params[3] from 6 to 5. Let's try:

params[0]:6, params[1]:0.3, params[2]:-4, params[3]:5, params[4]:4.3, params[5]:1.7, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:6, params[9]:6. This is a new set. Maybe this could lead to a better reward.

But I need to make sure that this is a new combination. Looking through the examples, I don't see this exact set. So, this might be a good candidate for exploration.
