SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to find the global optimal policy for the cartpole environment using reinforcement learning. The user mentioned that the current reward is around 500, but we're aiming for higher than that.

First, I remember that the goal is to balance the pole without letting it fall over or have the cart go too far. The state includes the cart's position, velocity, pole angle, and angular velocity. The action space has two options: push left (action 0) or right (action 1).

The reward function gives +1 for every time step where the pole is upright (within a small range around 0 radians) and the cart is within [-2.4, 2.4]. So, every successful time step increases the total reward.

The user provided some best performing parameters and recent ones. The top three were:

1. params[0]:6; params[1]:6; params[2]:-3; params[3]:6; params[4:-6]; params[5]:1.8; params[6]:-3.5; params[7]:4.5; params[8:-2.5]; params[9:-2.5]; reward:500
2. params[0]:6; same others except params[5] and [7]
3. params[0]:-6; others similar, with some positive values

The most recent ones were around 36.65, but that's lower than the top.

I think I need to adjust the parameters to get a higher reward. Let me look at the initial example where the reward was 500. It used params[0] as 6, which seems high, and others adjusted accordingly.

Maybe if I increase some parameters, the pole will stay upright more often. Also, perhaps making the cart's velocity have a better effect could help stabilize it within bounds.

Wait, in the initial example, params[1] was 6. If that parameter is related to the cart velocity, increasing it might make the cart react faster, which helps balance the pole without overshooting the position limits too much.

I should also check if other parameters can provide better control over the pole's angle and angular velocity. For instance, params[2] being -3 suggests damping the pole's angle, which is good because a stiffer pole would cause more oscillations. On the flip side, maybe params[3]:6 could help in stabilizing the pole's orientation.

Let me think about whether these parameter values lead to the pole staying upright and cart within bounds. If they do, then perhaps the reward will be higher. But if some parameters are too extreme, it might cause instability.

I should try tweaking params[0] a bit higher than 6, maybe around 7 or 8, while keeping others in line. Alternatively, if increasing some positive parameters can help, but I'm not sure how to balance them without making the system unstable.

Alternatively, perhaps adjusting the cart's velocity damping parameter could improve pole control. If params[2] is too low (like -3.5), maybe it's under damping. Maybe increasing it a bit would help in controlling the angle of the pole and keeping the position within bounds.

I'm also considering whether the angular velocity parameter, params[4], should be positive or negative. Since the cart's movement affects both linear and angular velocities, perhaps balancing these could prevent oscillations in the pole's balance.

Maybe I can try a few different combinations around 6 for some parameters and see which one gives the highest reward. It might take a couple of iterations to notice a clear improvement, but with enough exploration, it should find the optimal point.
