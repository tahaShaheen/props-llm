SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

Now you are at iteration 34 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of training examples for the CartPole environment with different parameter values and their corresponding episodic rewards. The goal is to find the global optimal policy, which should be around 500. The current examples have rewards up to 398.45, which is below 500, so we need to explore more.

First, I need to analyze the existing parameters. Looking at the top examples, the params that gave higher rewards (like the first one with 398.45) have some common patterns. For instance, params[0] is 6, params[1] is 0.3, params[2] is -4, params[3] is 6, and so on. The bias terms (params[8] and [9]) are around 5.3 to 6. 

But since the current maximum is 398, which is still below 500, the user is suggesting that we should explore more instead of exploiting the current local optimum. The exploration step size is 1.0, so we need to make changes of 1.0 to various parameters to find better regions.

Looking at the parameters, maybe some of them could be adjusted. For example, in the first example, params[2] is -4, but maybe increasing that to -3 or -5 could lead to better results. Also, the W matrix entries for the pole angle (params[4] and [5]) are around 4.3 and 1.7. Perhaps increasing those values might help in balancing the pole better.

Another thing to consider is the bias terms. The current examples have params[8] and [9] around 5.3 to 6. Maybe increasing them further could help, but since the max is 6.0, there's not much room. Alternatively, maybe adjusting them to lower values might help in some cases.

Also, looking at the other parameters, like params[6] and [7], which are -6 and 6. Maybe changing those could affect the angular velocity component. For instance, if params[6] is -6, perhaps increasing it to -5 or -7 (but wait, the range is [-6.0, 6.0], so -7 is not allowed. So maybe -5.0 is possible.)

But since we need to explore with a step size of 1.0, let's think of modifying some parameters by +/-1.0. For example, take the first example with the highest reward (params[0]: 6, params[1]: 0.3, params[2]: -4, params[3]: 6, etc.). Maybe changing params[2] from -4 to -5 (since that's within the range) and see what happens. Similarly, check other parameters for possible adjustments.

Alternatively, look for parameters that are not at the extremes. For instance, params[1] is 0.3 in some examples. Maybe adjusting that to 1.3 or -0.7 (as seen in other examples) could have different effects.

But since we need to explore, perhaps start by making a significant change to one of the parameters. Let's pick a parameter that's in the middle of the range. For example, in the first example, params[4] is 4.3. Increasing that by 1.0 to 5.3, and see if that helps. Also, params[5] is 1.7; maybe increasing that to 2.7.

Another approach: since the current highest reward is 398, which is close to 500, maybe the optimal parameters are in a different region. Let's try changing some parameters that haven't been explored much. For example, in the current examples, params[2] ranges from -5 to -3. Maybe trying params[2] as -6 (the lower bound) could lead to better results. Let's try that.

So, modifying params[2] from -4 to -6. Let's also adjust other parameters. For instance, if we take the first example and change params[2] to -6, and maybe adjust params[4] and [5] to higher values. But I need to make sure that all parameters are within [-6.0, 6.0].

Another thought: the policy is a linear one, so the weights might need to be tuned such that the state features are weighted appropriately. The cart position, velocity, pole angle, and angular velocity each have their own weights. Maybe the current examples are not balancing the pole effectively because of certain weights. For example, if the pole's angular velocity is not being countered properly, the pole might fall.

Alternatively, looking at the action selection: action is argmax(state @ W + B). So the weights and biases determine which action is chosen. If the weights for the pole angle are too low, the policy might not react quickly enough to balance the pole.

But without knowing the exact dynamics, it's hard to say. So the exploration step is necessary.

Let me try to create a new set of parameters by making a step of 1.0 in some parameters. For example, take the first example and change params[2] from -4 to -5 (since that's a step of -1.0). Also, maybe increase params[4] from 4.3 to 5.3. Similarly, check other parameters. Let's try that.

So, here's a possible new parameter set:

params[0]: 6 (unchanged)
params[1]: 0.3 (unchanged)
params[2]: -5 (changed from -4)
params[3]: 6 (unchanged)
params[4]: 5.3 (increased by 1.0)
params[5]: 2.7 (increased by 1.0)
params[6]: -6 (unchanged)
params[7]: 6 (unchanged)
params[8]: 5.3 (unchanged)
params[9]: 4.8 (changed from 6 to 4.8? Wait, but the step size is 1.0. Maybe decrease from 6 to 5.0?)

Wait, the user said during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So each parameter change should be +/-1.0. So if I take a parameter that's at 6.0, I can decrease it by 1.0 to 5.0. Similarly, if a parameter is at -6.0, I can increase it by 1.0 to -5.0.

Looking at the first example, params[8] and [9] are both 6.0. Maybe decreasing them by 1.0 to 5.0 each. Let's try that.

So, new parameters:

params[0]: 6
params[1]: 0.3
params[2]: -5 (from -4, step -1)
params[3]: 6
params[4]: 5.3 (from 4.3, step +1)
params[5]: 2.7 (from 1.7, step +1)
params[6]: -6
params[7]: 6
params[8]: 5.0 (from 6, step -1)
params[9]: 5.0 (from 6, step -1)

This way, we are making several changes with step size 1.0. This might lead us to a better region.

Alternatively, maybe focus on changing one parameter at a time. But the user's instruction says to explore, so perhaps multiple changes are acceptable as long as each is a step of 1.0.

Another possibility: take a parameter that's in the middle, like params[4] is 4.3. If we increase it to 5.3, and decrease params[5] from 1.7 to 0.7 (but that's a step of -1.0). However, that might not be helpful. Alternatively, increase params[5] to 2.7.

I think the first approach of adjusting params[2], [4], [5], [8], [9] is a good exploration step. Let's go with that.
