SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is working on optimizing a linear policy for the CartPole environment. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward, which they mention should be around 500. The current examples provided have rewards around 497, which is close but not quite there. The user's last response had a reward of 409.45, which is lower, so maybe they need to adjust their parameters.

Looking at the parameters in the examples, many of them have high values for W and B, like 6.0. However, some parameters are negative, like params[2] and params[6] being -6. The action is determined by the argmax of the state multiplied by W plus B. So, the weights and biases are crucial here.

The user's instruction says that if they're below 500, they should explore instead of exploit. Since the current best is around 497, which is close to 500, maybe a small adjustment could push it over. But the user also mentioned using a search step size of 1.0 during exploration. So perhaps they need to try varying some parameters by +/-1.0 from the current values.

Looking at the parameters that are frequently set to 6.0, maybe some of them could be adjusted. For instance, params[0] is 6.0 in many examples. Maybe reducing it slightly or increasing it further could help. However, since the maximum allowed is 6.0, increasing isn't possible. So maybe decreasing some of the high values or adjusting the negative ones.

Another thing to note is that the reward function is sensitive to the balance between the cart's position and the pole's angle. The weights for the cart position (params[0] and params[1]) and the pole angle (params[4] and params[5]) might need to be tuned. For example, if the cart position is too high, the cart might move too much, causing the pole to fall. Similarly, if the pole angle weights are too high, the policy might overcorrect.

Looking at the examples, params[4] and params[5] are often around 5.3 to 6.0. Maybe adjusting those could help. Also, the bias terms (params[8] and params[9]) are mostly 6.0, which might be pushing the action too much in one direction. Maybe reducing them slightly could allow for more balanced decisions.

But since the user is at iteration 133 out of 400, they might need to explore more. The previous examples show that some parameters are being varied, but maybe not all possible combinations. The user should try changing different parameters by 1.0 step, both increasing and decreasing where possible, to see if they can find a better combination.

For example, taking the current best parameters (from the first example: params[0]:6, params[1]:1.3, params[2]:-6, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:6, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:6, params[9]:6) and adjusting some of the parameters. Maybe decreasing params[4] from 5.3 to 4.3 or increasing it to 6.3 (but 6.3 is over the limit). Alternatively, adjusting params[8] or params[9] from 6.0 to 5.0.

Alternatively, trying to vary other parameters that haven't been changed much. For instance, params[1] is 1.3 in many examples. Maybe increasing it to 2.3 or decreasing to 0.3. But the user needs to avoid repeating previous params. Since the previous examples have tried some of these, they need to find new combinations.

Another approach is to look for parameters that are not at their extremes. For example, params[1] is 1.3, which is within the range. Maybe adjusting that to 2.3 or 0.3. Similarly, params[3] is 6.0, which is the max. Maybe reducing that to 5.0. But again, need to check previous examples to avoid repetition.

Since the user is instructed to explore with step size 1.0, perhaps trying to change one parameter by +/-1.0 from the current value. Let's take the current best parameters and adjust one of them. For example, if params[4] is 5.3, changing it to 6.3 (but that's over the limit) or 4.3. Since 4.3 is allowed, maybe that's a direction to try. However, in previous examples, params[4] was 4.3 and the reward was lower. So maybe that's not the way.

Alternatively, adjusting params[2] from -6 to -5 (but that's already tried in some examples). Hmm. Maybe adjusting params[7], which is 6.0, to 5.0. Or adjusting params[8] or params[9] from 6.0 to 5.0.

Another thought: the bias terms (params[8] and params[9]) are both 6.0 in many examples. If those are too high, the action might be biased towards one direction. Lowering them might allow the policy to be more responsive to the state. For example, changing params[8] to 5.0 and params[9] to 5.0. That could be a new parameter set to try.

So, putting that together: keeping most parameters the same as the best example, but changing params[8] and params[9] from 6.0 to 5.0. That would be a new parameter set. Let's see:

params[0]:6, params[1]:1.3, params[2]:-6, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:6, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:5, params[9]:5.

This hasn't been tried before in the examples provided. The user might want to test this to see if it improves the reward. Alternatively, adjusting other parameters. But given the instruction to explore, this could be a good candidate.
