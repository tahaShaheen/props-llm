SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to maximize the episodic reward f(params) for the cartpole environment using the given policy and parameters. The goal is around 500, which means it's a decent result but perhaps can be improved.

First, I need to understand the problem setup. The state of the system includes the cart's position, velocity, pole angle, and angular velocity. The action is either pushing left or right, determined by the linear policy with parameters W and B. The reward is +1 for each step where the pole is upright (angle between -0.418 and 0.418 radians) and the cart is within bounds.

The current setup uses a linear policy, which might not be optimal because it's too simplistic. However, with careful tuning of parameters, we should be able to find the global optimum around 500.

Looking at the provided examples, some have rewards in the hundreds, while others are lower. The most recent example shows params where all angles are 2.5, but the reward is only 9.20, which seems low. This suggests that not all parameters are being considered correctly, possibly because of constraints or dynamics.

I need to adjust the parameters to increase f(params). Let me start by increasing some parameters. For example, params[7] is set to 5 in one example but gives a lower reward than when it's increased further. Wait, no, that might not be the case. Maybe I should look for which parameters positively affect the reward.

Looking at the state variables: cart_position, velocity, pole_angle, and angular_velocity. Each of these has an impact on the reward. For instance, increasing the cart_velocity can help balance the pole more quickly, thus improving the reward over time.

I also notice that when params[6] is set to 0.8 in some examples, it might contribute positively. Maybe higher values for certain angles like pole_angle or angular_velocity could lead to better rewards because they affect the system's stability and control.

In the current setup, if I can increase the cart_velocity beyond a certain point without causing instability (which would result in lower velocity penalties), that could improve the reward. Also, ensuring the pole remains upright should contribute positively as it helps balance the cart.

I think I'll need to experiment with higher values for params[1] and [3], which are associated with velocity and angular velocity respectively. Increasing these might allow the system to be more balanced over time. Additionally, increasing params[2] (pole_angle) could help stabilize the pole, especially if it's falling down.

On the negative side, I should prevent any parameters from causing instability. So maybe decreasing params[0], [4], and others that could lead to high velocities or angular velocities is necessary. But since the goal is around 500, stability isn't the top priority here; rather, it's about maximizing the reward.

I also need to ensure that I'm not repeating examples that are already known to have low rewards because that would make me work in circles without progress. Instead, I'll try to find parameters that haven't been tested yet but could yield better results.

Perhaps starting with params[0] = -5 and increasing it gradually, while adjusting other parameters to see if the reward improves. It's a bit trial-and-error, but systematic adjustment should help reach higher rewards.

I'm also thinking about the exploration vs exploitation aspect. Since I need to try more parameters without biasing my search, maybe using a random initialization with some range would be better than sticking to previous examples. That way, I can explore more of the parameter space and find combinations that might yield even higher rewards.

Another consideration is whether any parameters have non-linear effects on the reward. For instance, perhaps pole_angle^2 or angular_velocity squared could have an impact that isn't linearly accounted for in the current setup.

I'll proceed by adjusting each parameter step-by-step, increasing them where they seem beneficial based on observed examples, while keeping others within known bounds to prevent negative impacts. I'll keep track of f(params) after each adjustment and stop when a satisfactory reward is achieved, or perhaps continue until further adjustments don't significantly improve the result.

Finally, once I have parameters that give me around 500, I can present them in the required format.
