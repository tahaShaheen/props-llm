SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 304 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of previous parameter sets and their corresponding rewards. The goal is to find the optimal parameters that maximize the episodic reward, aiming for around 500. From the examples, the best rewards are 500.00, and some variations around that. The parameters that achieved 500 have certain patterns.

Looking at the top params, the first few entries have params[0] at 6, params[1] at 2.3, params[2] at -5, params[3] at 6, params[4] at 5.3, params[5] at 6, params[6] at -6, params[7] at 6, params[8] and [9] at 5. However, there are some variations where params[4] is slightly lower, like 5.2 or 5.3, but the reward remains 500.00. 

But in some cases, when params[2] changes to -4 or -6, the reward drops. Also, when params[1] is 3.3 instead of 2.3, the reward is lower. Similarly, changing params[8] or [9] from 5 to 6 also reduces the reward. So the current best seems to be around the initial set with params[0] through [7] as 6, 2.3, -5, 6, 5.3, 6, -6, 6, and params[8] and [9] as 5.

Now, the user is at iteration 304, and we need to explore further. Since the global optimum is around 500, but the current examples have already hit that, maybe we need to check if there's a way to tweak parameters slightly to get even higher. However, since the examples already have 500.00, maybe the maximum is already achieved. But the user says that if we're below 500, we should explore. But in this case, the examples are at 500, so maybe we need to look for variations that haven't been tried yet.

Wait, but the user also said not to propose previously seen params. So looking at the previous entries, the first four examples have params[4] as 5.3, 5, 5.3, 5.2. Maybe trying a different value for params[4], like 5.4 or 5.1? Also, params[3] is at 6 in most cases. What if we adjust that? Or maybe other parameters like params[7]?

Alternatively, looking at the last example provided: params[7] was changed from 6 to 5, which resulted in a lower reward (461.05). So keeping params[7] at 6 seems better. 

Another thing to check is if there are any parameters that haven't been varied much. For example, params[1] is consistently 2.3 except for one case where it was 3.3, which gave a lower reward. So maybe keeping params[1] at 2.3 is better. 

What about params[2] at -5? In one case, it was -4 and the reward dropped. So maybe -5 is better. 

Looking at params[6], which is -6 in most cases. If we try changing it to -5, but in one example, that gave a lower reward. So keeping -6 might be better. 

So, perhaps the current best parameters are already at the optimal. However, the user mentioned that the global optimum should be around 500, and if we're below that, we should explore. Since the current examples have 500, maybe there's no need to explore further. But the user might be expecting us to find a slightly better value. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a parameter that hasn't been adjusted yet. For example, params[8] and [9] are at 5. What if we try 5.5 or 4.5? Let's see. In one example, when params[9] was 6, the reward was lower. So maybe 5 is the optimal for those. 

Alternatively, maybe adjusting other parameters. For instance, params[0] is at 6. Could it be higher? But the maximum allowed is 6. So no. Similarly, params[3] is at 6, which is the upper limit. 

Hmm. Since the current examples have already achieved 500, and the user hasn't indicated that further exploration is needed, maybe the answer is to stick with the parameters that gave 500. However, the user said not to propose previously seen params. So we need to find a new set of parameters that haven't been tried yet but are in the vicinity. 

Looking at the parameters, maybe changing params[4] from 5.3 to 5.4. Let's try that. Also, check other parameters. For example, params[5] is at 6. What if we lower it to 5.9? Or maybe increase it? But 6 is the upper limit. 

Alternatively, adjust params[2] from -5 to -5.1? But the parameters have to be in increments of 0.1. Wait, the user said that params are in the range [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place. So possible values are like -6.0, -5.9, ..., 5.9, 6.0. 

So, for example, changing params[4] from 5.3 to 5.4. Let's try that. Also, check other parameters. Maybe params[7] is 6, but what if we lower it to 5.9? But in previous examples, changing params[7] to 5 led to a lower reward. So maybe 6 is better. 

Another approach: since the current best has params[4] at 5.3, maybe trying 5.4 or 5.2. Let's see. But in previous examples, 5.2 was tried and gave 500.00. So maybe 5.3 is the optimal. 

Alternatively, check other parameters. For example, params[0] is at 6. What if we lower it to 5.9? But that might reduce the reward. 

Alternatively, look for parameters that have not been varied much. For example, params[2] is at -5. What if we try -5.1 or -4.9? But in previous examples, -4 and -6 were tried and gave lower rewards. So maybe -5 is the best. 

Given all that, perhaps the current best parameters are already the optimal. However, the user might want us to propose a new set that hasn't been tried yet but is in the vicinity. For example, changing params[4] from 5.3 to 5.4, and see if that gives a better reward. Let's try that. 

So the new params would be:

params[0]: 6.0
params[1]: 2.3
params[2]: -5.0
params[3]: 6.0
params[4]: 5.4
params[5]: 6.0
params[6]: -6.0
params[7]: 6.0
params[8]: 5.0
params[9]: 5.0

This is a new set not seen in the previous examples. Let's propose this.
</think>

params[0]: 6.0, params[1]: 2.3, params[2]: -5.0, params[3]: 6.0, params[4]: 5.4, params[5]: 6.0, params[6]: -6.0, params[7]: 6.0, params[8]: 5.0, params[9]: 5.0
