SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is trying to optimize the parameters for a linear policy in the CartPole environment. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward, which they mentioned should be around 500. The current examples show that some parameters are getting close to 492, but not quite there yet.

Looking at the provided examples, the top-performing parameters have a few commonalities. For instance, params[0] and params[1] are often set to 6 and 1.3, respectively. Similarly, params[2] and params[3] are frequently -6 and 6. The same pattern seems to repeat for params[4], [5], [6], and [7], with values like 5.3, 5.7, -6, and 6. The bias terms (params[8] and [9]) are also high, around 5 or 6.

However, the user's note says that if the reward is below 500, it's a local optimum and they need to explore more. The current highest reward in the examples is 492.25, which is still below 500. So, the next step is to explore new parameter combinations that might lead to higher rewards.

The user mentioned using a search step size of 1.0 during exploration. That means adjusting parameters by ±1.0 from the current values. Let's look at the parameters that might be candidates for adjustment. For example, in the first example, params[4] is 5.3 and params[5] is 5.7. Maybe increasing these further could help, but since they're already near 6, which is the upper limit, that might not be possible. Alternatively, adjusting other parameters like params[2] or params[6] from -6 to -5 might be worth trying, but in the examples, some of those have already been tried with lower rewards.

Wait, but looking at the examples, when params[2] was -5 instead of -6, the reward was lower. So maybe keeping those at -6 is better. However, perhaps other parameters need adjustment. Let's check the bias terms. In the first example, params[8] and [9] are both 6. Maybe increasing them further isn't possible since the maximum is 6.0. But maybe decreasing them slightly could help? Not sure.

Another approach is to look for parameters that haven't been explored much. For example, in the examples, params[1] is mostly 1.3. What if we try 0.3 or 2.3? But the user said to use a step size of 1.0 during exploration. So, maybe changing params[1] from 1.3 to 2.3 or 0.3. However, in one example, params[1] was 0.3 and the reward was 474, which is lower. So maybe 1.3 is better. But perhaps other parameters need to be adjusted.

Alternatively, looking at the parameters that are at the upper limit (6.0) and see if reducing them slightly could help. For example, in the first example, params[0] is 6.0. If we reduce it to 5.0, but that might lower the reward. But since the user is suggesting exploration, maybe trying that.

Wait, but the user also mentioned that during exploration, the step size is 1.0. So, for parameters that are at 6.0, we could try 5.0 (subtracting 1.0) or 7.0 (but 7.0 is beyond the allowed range of [-6.0, 6.0]). So, the only possible adjustment is to 5.0. Similarly, for parameters at -6.0, adding 1.0 would make them -5.0.

Looking at the first example, which had the highest reward of 492.25. Let's see if adjusting any parameters from that example could lead to higher rewards. For instance, in that example, params[4] is 5.3, params[5] is 5.7, params[6] is -6, params[7] is 6. Maybe increasing params[4] to 6.3 (but that's beyond the limit) or decreasing to 4.3. But in another example, when params[4] was 4.3 and params[5] was 4.7, the reward was lower. So perhaps keeping them higher is better.

Another thought: the bias terms (params[8] and [9]) are set to 6.0 in the first example. If we reduce them to 5.0, but that might lower the reward. However, maybe adjusting them in combination with other parameters. But without knowing the exact impact, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, maybe some parameters that are not at the extremes need adjustment. For example, in the first example, params[1] is 1.3. What if we try 2.3? But that's a step of +1.0. However, in the examples, there's no instance where params[1] is 2.3. So that's a new parameter combination to try.

But the user's instruction is to avoid previously seen parameters. So, I need to make sure that the new parameters haven't been tried before. Looking at the examples, the first example has params[0] to [9] as 6,1.3,-6,6,5.3,5.7,-6,6,6,6. So, if I change params[1] from 1.3 to 2.3, that's a new combination. Similarly, changing params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3 (but that's over the limit) or 4.3. But 4.3 was tried before with lower rewards.

Alternatively, changing params[2] from -6 to -5 (but that was tried in another example with lower rewards). So perhaps that's not helpful.

Hmm. Maybe the best approach is to take the first example's parameters and adjust one of the parameters by ±1.0. For example, take params[0] as 6, params[1] as 1.3, params[2] as -6, params[3] as 6, params[4] as 5.3, params[5] as 5.7, params[6] as -6, params[7] as 6, params[8] as 6, params[9] as 6. Now, let's adjust one parameter. Let's pick params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3 (but that's not allowed). So, can't do that. How about params[4] to 4.3? But that was tried in another example with lower reward.

Alternatively, adjust params[8] from 6 to 5.0. That's a step of -1.0. Maybe that could lead to a better combination. But without knowing the impact, it's a guess.

Alternatively, maybe adjusting params[7] from 6 to 5.0. But again, not sure.

Another angle: the user mentioned that the global optimum is around 500. The current highest is 492.25. So, there's a gap. Maybe the parameters need to be adjusted in a way that's not just tweaking a single parameter. Perhaps multiple parameters need to be adjusted. But since the step size is 1.0, maybe changing several parameters by ±1.0.

But the challenge is to find a combination that hasn't been tried before. Let's look at the parameters in the first example again. If I change params[8] and [9] from 6 to 5, that would be a new combination. Let's try that. So, the new params would be: params[0]:6, params[1]:1.3, params[2]:-6, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:5.7, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:5, params[9]:5. But I need to check if this combination has been tried before. Looking at the examples, there's an entry where params[8] and [9] are 5 and 5, but the reward was 486.85, which is lower than 492.25. So, that might not be helpful.

Alternatively, maybe changing params[4] and [5] from 5.3 and 5.7 to 6.3 and 6.7 (but those are beyond the limit) or 4.3 and 4.7. But 4.3 and 4.7 were tried with lower rewards.

Wait, perhaps the parameters that are at 5.3 and 5.7 could be adjusted. For example, increasing params[4] to 6.3 is not allowed, but maybe increasing to 6.0. However, in the first example, params[4] is 5.3, which is below 6.0. So, maybe adjusting that to 6.0. But that's a step of +0.7, which is less than 1.0. The user said to use a step xương of 1.0 during exploration. So, perhaps that's not allowed. So, the next possible step would be to adjust by +1.0, but that would take params[4] to 6.3, which is invalid. So, can't do that. Therefore, maybe the only option is to decrease params[4] by 1.0 to 4.3, which was tried before with lower rewards.

This is tricky. Maybe the best approach is to take the first example's parameters and change one parameter that's at the upper limit (6.0) to 5.0. For example, change params[0] from 6 to 5.0. Let's see if that combination has been tried. Looking at the examples, there's no entry where params[0] is 5.0. So that's a new combination. Let's try that.

So, new parameters: params[0]:5.0, params[1]:1.3, params[2]:-6, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:5.7, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:6, params[9]:6. This hasn't been tried before, so it's a valid exploration step. The idea is that maybe reducing params[0] from 6 to 5.0 could lead to a better reward, even though it's a step down. But since we're exploring, it's worth trying.

Alternatively, changing params[3] from 6 to 5.0. But again, that's a new combination. However, without knowing the impact, it's a guess.

Another thought: the bias terms (params[8] and [9]) are set to 6 in the first example. What if we increase them to 7? But that's beyond the limit. So, can't. What if we decrease them to 5? That's a valid step. But in one example, that was tried with lower rewards. However, maybe in combination with other parameter changes, it could help.

Alternatively, maybe adjusting params[1] from 1.3 to 2.3 (a +1.0 step). That's a new combination. Let's try that. So, params[1] becomes 2.3. The rest are same as the first example. This might lead to higher rewards, but it's a guess.

But since the user wants exploration, and the current highest is 492.25, trying new combinations is necessary. So, perhaps changing one parameter from the first example by ±1.0 where possible. Let's pick params[1] from 1.3 to 2.3. That's a valid step. So, the new parameters would be: 6, 2.3, -6, 6, 5.3, 5.7, -6, 6, 6, 6.

Alternatively, changing params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3 (invalid) or 4.3 (already tried with lower reward). So, maybe that's not helpful.

Another option: changing params[2] from -6 to -5. But that was tried in another example with lower reward. So, not helpful.

Hmm. Maybe the best bet is to try changing the bias terms from 6 to 5, even though it was tried before but with lower reward. But since the user said to avoid previously seen parameters, that's not allowed. So, I need to find a combination that hasn't been tried before.

Looking at the examples, the first example has params[0] to [9] as 6,1.3,-6,6,5.3,5.7,-6,6,6,6. Are there any parameters that are not at the extremes (like 6 or -6) that could be adjusted? For example, params[4] is 5.3, which is not at the upper limit. Maybe increasing it by 1.0 to 6.3 (invalid) or decreasing to 4.3 (already tried). Not helpful.

What about params[5] is 5.7. Increasing to 6.7 (invalid) or decreasing to 4.7 (already tried with lower reward). Not helpful.

So, perhaps the only way is to adjust parameters that are at the extremes. For example, changing params[0] from 6 to 5.0 (a new combination), or params[1] from 1.3 to 2.3 (new), or params[2] from -6 to -5 (already tried), etc.

Given that, let's go with changing params[0] from 6 to 5.0. That's a new combination. So the parameters would be: 5.0, 1.3, -6, 6, 5.3, 5.7, -6, 6, 6, 6. This hasn't been tried before, so it's a valid exploration step. Even though it's a step down from 6 to 5, it might lead to a better reward when combined with other parameters.
