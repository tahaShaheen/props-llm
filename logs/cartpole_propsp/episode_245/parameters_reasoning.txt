SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to improve the global optimal policy for the cartpole environment using a linear policy. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward by adjusting the policy parameters. 

First, I need to understand the setup. The state space has four dimensions: position, velocity, angle, and angular velocity. Each parameter (W and B) form a linear policy where action = max(state @ W + B). There are 18 parameters in total.

The reward is +1 each time step the pole is upright and within bounds. The episode ends if the pole flips over or the cart goes out of its frame. So, I need to encourage policies that keep the pole balanced and keep the cart near the center.

Looking at the parameters provided, they seem to have a mix of positive and negative values. For instance, params[0] is either 6 or -6, which could mean pushing the cart further left or right. Similarly, other parameters vary between -3.5 and 4.5, indicating varying strengths in different actions.

I notice that some params are higher than others. For example, at iteration 245, a param set where all params[0:9] are 6 gives the highest reward of ~493.90. But wait, does that mean each action is maximized? Because if W and B are such that each action leads to maximum reward when state is favorable.

However, perhaps not all actions can be pushed optimally at once due to conflicting benefits. For example, increasing the left velocity (params[1]) might help balance the pole but could make it harder to maintain the pole upright. So, there's a trade-off between moving the cart and balancing the pole.

I also see that some parameters are negative. For instance, params[4] is -6 when all others in a group of 5 are 0. This suggests that sometimes pushing left or right is not beneficial but necessary for exploration. The negative values might indicate that the current policy is trying different actions to explore other possibilities.

The user wants me to find better parameters. They have provided several examples, including params where some are -6 and others are positive, giving high rewards. But perhaps the optimal set isn't just any combination of those but one that actually works for balancing.

Looking at another example: params[0] = -4.5, params[1]=-3.5, etc., gives a reward of 131.35. That seems better than some earlier examples. Maybe this configuration is more effective in keeping the pole upright and cart near the center.

But I'm not sure if that's the absolute maximum. The user mentioned around 500 for the global optimum, so perhaps even these params aren't sufficient. It might require more careful tuning or exploration of different parameter combinations.

I think the key here is to identify which parameters are positively contributing and adjust them accordingly. For instance, increasing params[1] (cart velocity) when state is favorable might help balance the pole better than just pushing it left. Similarly, balancing params[5] and [6] could ensure the cart stays within bounds.

Also, considering that some parameters have negative values, perhaps those are being used for exploration to avoid local optima. But maybe they should be set in a way that doesn't hurt performance while still exploring other actions.

Overall, I need to balance moving the cart (params[1] and [5]) with keeping it within bounds (params[4] and [6]), ensuring the pole remains upright (params[2] and [3]). It might require iterative trials or using more advanced optimization techniques beyond just trial and error.
