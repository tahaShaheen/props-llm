SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user provided several examples of params and their corresponding f(params) values. Most of them have a reward of 500.00, which is the maximum mentioned. But the user mentioned that the global optimum should be around 500, and if we're below that, we should explore instead of exploiting.

Looking at the examples, the first few params have f(params) of 500.00. For instance, the first example has params[0] to params[9] with various values, and the reward is 500.00. However, when some parameters are changed, like params[8] from 3.3 to 4.3, the reward remains 500.00. That suggests that maybe there's a range of parameters that can achieve the same high reward. But the user says that if we're at 500, we should explore to find the global optimum, which might be higher.

Wait, but the user also said that the global optimum should be around 500. So maybe 500 is the maximum possible. However, the initial instruction says that if we are below 500, we should explore. But in the examples, many have 500.00 already. However, the user might be indicating that even though some examples reach 500, there's still a possibility of finding a higher value, but the global optimum is around 500. So maybe 500 is the maximum, and the examples are just showing that multiple parameter sets can reach that.

But the user's instruction says that if you are below that, it's a local optimum and you should explore. Since the examples given have 500.00, perhaps the next step is to check if there are parameters that can reach higher than 500. However, the user's note says that the global optimum is around 500. So maybe 500 is the maximum, and the task is to find parameters that achieve that.

But the problem is that the user is at iteration 9, and they need to propose new parameters that haven't been seen before. The previous examples have various parameters, but some of them are similar. For instance, the first example has params[0] to params[9] with values like 3.2, 4.3, 1.3, 4.6, -2.4, 1.9, -4.9, -0.1, 3.3, 4.2. Then, in the next example, params[8] is changed to 4.3, but the rest are the same. So maybe the user is trying to find variations around that set.

But the user says not to propose previously seen params. So I need to generate new parameters that are different from the ones in the examples. Also, during exploration, the step size should be 1.0. So maybe I can take the existing parameters and add or subtract 1.0 from some of them.

Looking at the first example, let's take params[6] which is -4.9. If I add 1.0 to it, it becomes -3.9. But that's already in one of the examples. So maybe I need to look for other parameters to adjust.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for parameters that haven't been tried yet. For example, in the first example, params[0] is 3.2. If I change that to 3.2 + 1.0 = 4.2, but that was already tried in one of the examples and resulted in 491.10. So that's worse. Maybe changing other parameters.

Looking at params[7] in the first example is -0.1. If I change that to -0.1 + 1.0 = 0.9, but that's already in one of the examples and still got 500.00. So that's not helpful.

What about params[4] which is -2.4. If I change that to -2.4 + 1.0 = -1.4. That's a new value. Let's try that. So modifying params[4] from -2.4 to -1.4. Also, maybe adjust other parameters by 1.0 step.

But I need to ensure that the new parameters are not in the previous examples. Let me check the previous examples again. The first example's params are:

params[0]: 3.2; params[1]: 4.3; params[2]: 1.3; params[3]: 4.6; params[4]: -2.4; params[5]: 1.9; params[6]: -4.9; params[7]: -0.1; params[8]: 3.3; params[9]: 4.2.

If I change params[4] to -1.4, that's new. Let's do that. Also, maybe change another parameter. For example, params[2] is 1.3. Changing that to 1.3 + 1.0 = 2.3. But in one of the examples, params[2] was 2.3. However, in that example, other parameters were different. Let me check. Yes, there was an example where params[2] is 2.3, but others were different. So maybe that's acceptable.

Alternatively, let's pick a parameter that hasn't been adjusted much. For example, params[5] is 1.9. Changing that to 1.9 + 1.0 = 2.9. That's a new value. Let's try that.

So, modifying params[4] from -2.4 to -1.4, and params[5] from 1.9 to 2.9. Let's see. Also, maybe adjust params[6] from -4.9 to -5.9 (but that was tried in an example and resulted in 500.00). Alternatively, maybe adjust params[8] from 3.3 to 4.3 (but that was tried and resulted in 500.00 as well).

Alternatively, let's try changing params[0] from 3.2 to 4.2 (but that was tried and resulted in lower reward). Not a good idea.

Another approach: since the examples with params[0] to params[9] as in the first example have 500.00, perhaps we can try to slightly perturb some parameters. For example, changing params[6] from -4.9 to -3.9 (but that was in an example and still got 500.00). So that's not helpful.

Wait, the user said that during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So maybe we need to make larger changes. Let's take the first example and change one parameter by +1.0 or -1.0. For example, params[0] is 3.2. Changing it to 4.2 (already tried, lower reward). How about changing params[0] to 2.2 (another example had that and got 33.00). Not good.

What about params[1] in the first example is 4.3. Changing that to 5.3. That's a new value. Let's try that. So params[1] becomes 5.3. Also, maybe change another parameter. For example, params[3] is 4.6. Changing that to 5.6. That's a new value.

But I need to make sure that these parameters haven't been tried before. Since the examples don't have these values, that's acceptable.

So, the new params could be:

params[0]: 3.2; params[1]: 5.3; params[2]: 1.3; params[3]: 5.6; params[4]: -2.4; params[5]: 1.9; params[6]: -4.9; params[7]: -0.1; params[8]: 3.3; params[9]: 4.2.

This changes params[1] and params[3] by +1.0 each. Let's check if this is a new combination. Since previous examples didn't have these values, it's a new set. This might be a good exploration step.

Alternatively, maybe changing params[7] from -0.1 to 0.9 (which was tried in an example and still got 500.00). Not helpful.

Another idea: look for parameters that are at the edge of the range. For example, in the first example, params[6] is -4.9. The range is [-6.0, 6.0]. So maybe changing params[6] to -6.0 (already tried in an example and got 500.00). Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe changing params[7] to -1.1 (as in an example) or other values.

But since the user says to explore with step size 1.0, maybe changing one parameter by 1.0 from the existing ones. For example, in the first example, let's take params[6] which is -4.9. Adding 1.0 gives -3.9 (already in an example). Subtracting 1.0 gives -5.9 (also in an example). So those are already tried.

What about params[2] is 1.3. Adding 1.0 gives 2.3 (which was in an example, but that example had lower reward). So that's not helpful.

Hmm. Maybe the existing examples are already around the optimal parameters, and further exploration might not be necessary. However, the user said that if the current value is below 500, we should explore. But since the examples have 500.00, maybe the next step is to try to find a better value, but the user says that the global optimum is around 500. So perhaps 500 is the maximum, and the task is to find parameters that achieve that.

But the user's instruction says that if you are below that, you should explore. Since the examples are at 500, maybe the next step is to check if there are other parameters that can achieve the same or higher. However, since the maximum is supposed to be around 500, it's possible that 500 is the maximum.

In that case, maybe the best approach is to try small perturbations around the existing parameters that achieved 500.00. For example, changing one parameter by 0.1, but the user said during exploration, the step size should be 1.0. So perhaps changing parameters by 1.0 steps.

Wait, but the user said during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So even if we are at a local optimum (500), we should explore by changing parameters by 1.0 steps. However, the examples show that changing some parameters by 1.0 steps (like params[8] from 3.3 to 4.3) still gives 500.00. So maybe the function is flat in some regions, and the maximum is indeed 500.

But the user's note says that the global optimum is around 500. So maybe the maximum is 500, and the task is to find parameters that reach that. In that case, the examples already have parameters that reach 500.00, but the user wants to ensure that we are not stuck in a local optimum. However, since the examples have 500.00, maybe the next step is to check if there are other parameters that can achieve the same, but with different values.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the examples, and the actual maximum is higher. But the user's note says the global optimum is around 500. So I think 500 is the maximum.

In that case, perhaps the best approach is to slightly perturb the parameters that have achieved 500.00. For example, changing one parameter by 1.0 step. Let's take the first example and change params[0] from 3.2 to 4.2 (but that was tried and gave lower reward). Not good. How about changing params[0] to 2.2 (also tried, lower reward). Not good.

Alternatively, changing params[6] from -4.9 to -5.9 (already tried, got 500.00). So that's not helpful. Maybe changing params[7] from -0.1 to 0.9 (already tried, got 500.00). So that's not helpful.

Hmm. It seems that many of the parameters that are changed by 1.0 steps still give 500.00. So maybe the function is flat in that region, and the maximum is indeed 500. So perhaps the next step is to try a new set of parameters that haven't been tried before, but with a step size of 1.0.

For example, take the first example and change params[4] from -2.4 to -1.4 (a step of +1.0). Let's try that. So:

params[0]: 3.2; params[1]: 4.3; params[2]: 1.3; params[3]: 4.6; params[4]: -1.4; params[5]: 1.9; params[6]: -4.9; params[7]: -0.1; params[8]: 3.3; params[9]: 4.2.

This changes params[4] by +1.0. This hasn't been tried before in the examples, so it's a new parameter set. Let's propose this.
</think>

params[0]: 3.2, params[1]: 4.3, params[2]: 1.3, params[3]: 4.6, params[4]: -1.4, params[5]: 1.9, params[6]: -4.9, params[7]: -0.1, params[8]: 3.3, params[9]: 4.2
