SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.
params[0]: -3.6; params[1]: 0.4; params[2]: -5.4; params[3]: -3.3; params[4]: 3.2; params[5]: 0.8; params[6]: -3.4; params[7]: 4; params[8]: 2.8; params[9]: 3.6; f(params): 88.35
params[0]: -3.6; params[1]: 0.4; params[2]: -5.4; params[3]: -3.3; params[4]: 5; params[5]: 0.7; params[6]: -3.4; params[7]: 4; params[8]: 2.8; params[9]: 3.6; f(params): 84.30
params[0]: 6; params[1]: -3; params[2]: 1.5; params[3]: 2.8; params[4]: 1.5; params[5]: -0.2; params[6]: -1; params[7]: 4.7; params[8]: 3.3; params[9]: 2.2; f(params): 61.65
params[0]: -2.1; params[1]: 1.2; params[2]: 2.8; params[3]: -4.3; params[4]: 1.9; params[5]: 2.8; params[6]: -1.7; params[7]: -0.7; params[8]: -2.8; params[9]: -1.1; f(params): 53.00
params[0]: 1.2; params[1]: 2.8; params[2]: -4.3; params[3]: -5.6; params[4]: -0.8; params[5]: -3.9; params[6]: 0.7; params[7]: 3.2; params[8]: -0.3; params[9]: -0.7; f(params): 48.80
params[0]: -3.6; params[1]: -3.6; params[2]: -3.4; params[3]: -3.6; params[4]: -3.5; params[5]: -3.7; params[6]: -3.7; params[7]: -3.5; params[8]: -3.6; params[9]: -3.6; f(params): 47.25
params[0]: 1.2; params[1]: 2.2; params[2]: 0.3; params[3]: -5.6; params[4]: -0.8; params[5]: -3.9; params[6]: 0.7; params[7]: 3.2; params[8]: 1.9; params[9]: 2.8; f(params): 46.00
params[0]: -3.6; params[1]: 0.4; params[2]: -5.4; params[3]: -3.3; params[4]: 5; params[5]: 0.7; params[6]: -3.4; params[7]: 4; params[8]: 2.8; params[9]: 3.6; f(params): 84.30


Now you are at iteration 30 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to find the optimal parameters for the cartpole environment using this policy optimizer method. The user provided several training examples with different parameters and their corresponding rewards. They want me to continue searching based on those examples.

Looking at the data, I see that some parameters give a reward of around 500 or higher. For instance, when params[8] is 4, others have similar rewards. However, I noticed one example where all params except params[8] are set to -3.6 and params[9] is 3.6, which resulted in a reward of 47.25. This seems too low compared to the other examples. Maybe that's not part of the maximum.

Another example shows a reward of around 80 or higher. It looks like when params[8] is set to 2.8 and others are -3.6, it gives an even higher reward. So far, all these options have positive rewards, which is good because we're aiming for around 500.

I should focus on the examples that give rewards of at least 47 or higher. Let me check if there's a set where params[8] is 2.8 and others are -3.6, which gives 61.65. That seems like a good candidate because it's giving a positive reward.

Wait, the user mentioned that the global optimum should be around 500. So they might have intended higher rewards but maybe there's an error in how I'm interpreting their data or some examples are not relevant.

Looking at other parameters where params[8] is 2.8 and others are -3.6, like [params[0], ..., params[9]] = [-3.6, ... , 4], it gives a reward of 61.65. That's better than the previous ones. But I need to see if that's the highest.

Wait, in another example, when params are all -3.6 except one which is set to 2.8, like [params[0]:-2.1, params[1]:1.2,...], it gives a reward of 53. So, this is lower than 61. But maybe there's another combination where the parameters are slightly different but still give higher rewards.

Another example has all params set to -3.6 except one which is 3.6 in some cases, leading to lower rewards like 47.25 or 84.30. So perhaps that's not part of the optimal range.

So, considering all these examples, the best reward I see so far is around 61.65 with params set to [-3.6, -3.6, 1.5, -3.3, ...]. This seems promising because it gives a higher than average reward.

I should focus on this set of parameters as my next step because they are giving me the highest rewards so far. I'll try adjusting some parameters around -3.6 and 1.5 to see if that improves the result or if it's just an overfitted example.
