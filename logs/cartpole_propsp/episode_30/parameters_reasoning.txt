SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).

Now you are at iteration 30 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is working on optimizing a linear policy for the CartPole environment. They've provided a bunch of training examples where the reward is 500.00, which seems to be the maximum. But the note says that the global optimum should be around 500, and if they're below that, they should explore instead of exploit. However, in the examples given, most of the params have a reward of 500.00 already. The last example shows a params with f(params) of 500.00, and the current iteration is 30 out of 400.

Wait, the user's message says they are at iteration 30, and they need me to provide the next params. But looking at the examples, many of them already reach 500.00. However, the note says that if the current value is below 500, they should explore. But in this case, the examples have already achieved 500.00. However, the user might be in a situation where they need to explore further to confirm that 500 is indeed the maximum or if there's a higher value possible.

But the problem is that the user has already provided examples where the reward is 500.00, and the current iteration is 30. Since the maximum steps are 400, there's a lot more iterations left. However, the user's instruction is to propose new params that haven't been seen before. The examples given have various params, but the ones that achieved 500.00 are all similar in structure. For instance, params[0] is 3.2, params[1] 4.3, params[2] 1.3, params[3] 4.6, params[4] -2.4, params[5] 1.9, params[6] -4.9, params[7] -0.1, params[8] 3.3, params[9] 4.2. Some variations in params[8] and [9] but mostly the same.

Since the user wants to maximize f(params), and the current examples have already hit 500.00, but the note says that the global optimum should be around 500. Maybe the user is trying to confirm that they can't go beyond 500. However, the instruction says that if you are below 500, you should explore. But in this case, the examples are already at 500. So perhaps the user is in a situation where they need to check if there are any other params that can achieve the same or higher, but given that the maximum is 500, maybe the best is to stick with the existing ones.

But the user's instruction says that during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. However, the current examples have already achieved 500.00. So maybe the next step is to explore by perturbing some parameters. For example, looking at the params that achieved 500.00, perhaps changing one of the parameters by 1.0 to see if it can maintain or increase the reward. But since the user says not to propose previously seen params, we need to find new ones.

Looking at the examples, the params that achieved 500.00 have params[0] as 3.2, but in one example, params[0] was 4.2 and the reward was 483.00, which is lower. Similarly, when params[0] was 2.2, the reward was 246.05. So maybe 3.2 is a good value for params[0]. However, in the last example, params[8] was 5.3 and params[9] was 5.2, which gave 500.00. So perhaps adjusting those parameters.

But since the user wants to explore, maybe trying to change some other parameters. For example, looking at params[6], which was -4.9 in most examples. Maybe changing that to -5.9 or -3.9. But in the examples, those have been tried and resulted in 500.00. However, the user says not to propose previously seen params. So maybe changing another parameter that hasn't been varied much.

Looking at params[5], which is 1.9 in most examples. Maybe changing that to 2.9 or 0.9. But in some examples, like the one where params[5] was 2.9, the reward was 500.00. So that's already been tried. Similarly, params[4] was -2.4 in most cases, but in one example, it was -1.4 and the reward was 448.80, which is lower. So maybe keeping params[4] at -2.4.

Another parameter to consider is params[7], which was -0.1 in most examples. Changing that to 0.9 or -1.1. But those have been tried and still gave 500.00. So perhaps the parameters that haven't been varied much are params[2], params[3], params[8], params[9]. For example, in one example, params[2] was 2.3, which gave 500.00. So maybe changing params[2] to something else. But since the user wants to explore, perhaps trying to adjust params[8] and [9] more. For instance, in one example, params[8] was 2.3 and params[9] was 3.2, which gave 500.00. So maybe trying to adjust those further.

Alternatively, looking at the parameters that have been changed in the examples, but the user wants new ones. Since the previous examples have tried various combinations, maybe the next step is to explore by changing a parameter that hasn't been altered much. For example, params[1] is 4.3 in most examples. Maybe changing that to 5.3 or 3.3. But in one example, params[1] was 4.3, and when it was 4.3, the reward was 500.00. However, if we change params[1] to 5.3, that's a new value. But we need to ensure that the new params haven't been used before.

Looking through the examples, the user has tried varying params[0], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], but perhaps not all combinations. For example, in one example, params[0] was 3.2, but in another, it was 4.2 and 2.2. So maybe trying a new value for params[0], like 3.2 ± 1.0. But 3.2 +1.0 is 4.2, which was tried and gave 483.00. 3.2 -1.0 is 2.2, which gave 246.05. So those are worse. Therefore, maybe keeping params[0] at 3.2.

Another parameter that hasn't been varied much is params[3]. In most examples, it's 4.6. In one example, it was 5.6 and another 3.6. Both gave 500.00. So maybe changing params[3] to 6.6 (but that's beyond the 6.0 range) or 2.6. Wait, the range is [-6.0, 6.0]. So 2.6 is within range. But in the examples, 3.6 and 5.6 were tried. So maybe trying 6.6 is not allowed. So perhaps 2.6. But that's a new value.

Alternatively, looking at params[8], which in some examples was 2.3, 3.3, 5.3. Maybe trying 4.3. But that's already been tried in some examples. For example, in the first example, params[8] was 3.3. So 4.3 is a new value. But in one of the examples, params[8] was 4.3 and the reward was 500.00. So that's already been tried. So perhaps trying 5.3 or 6.3, but 6.3 is out of range. So 5.3 is allowed. But in one example, params[8] was 5.3 and gave 500.00. So that's already been tried.

Hmm. It's a bit tricky because many of the parameters that could be varied have already been tested in the examples. The user's instruction is to not propose previously seen params. So perhaps looking for parameters that have not been varied in the examples. For instance, in the examples, params[8] and [9] have been varied, but maybe other parameters. Let's check:

Looking at the examples:

params[0] varies between 2.2, 3.2, 4.2
params[1] is always 4.3
params[2] varies between 0.3, 1.3, 2.3
params[3] varies between 3.6, 4.6, 5.6
params[4] varies between -3.4, -2.4, -1.4
params[5] varies between 1.9, 2.9
params[6] varies between -6.0, -5.9, -4.9, -3.9
params[7] varies between -1.1, -0.1, 0.9
params[8] varies between 2.3, 3.3, 5.3
params[9] varies between 3.2, 4.2, 5.2

So the parameters that have not been varied much are params[1], which is always 4.3. Maybe changing that to 5.3 or 3.3. But in the examples, when params[1] was 4.3, the reward was 500.00. However, if we change params[1] to 5.3, that's a new value. But we need to check if that's allowed. Since the user says that the search step size during exploration is 1.0, maybe changing params[1] by 1.0 from 4.3 to 5.3 or 3.3.

But in the examples, when params[1] was 4.3, the reward was 500.00. So changing it to 5.3 might be a good exploration step. Let's consider that. So, for example, changing params[1] from 4.3 to 5.3, and keeping other parameters the same. But we need to ensure that this hasn't been done before. Looking at the examples, none of them have params[1] as 5.3. So that's a new parameter set.

Alternatively, changing params[2] from 1.3 to 2.3 or 0.3. But in the examples, those have been tried. For instance, params[2] was 0.3, 1.3, 2.3. So those are already covered.

Another parameter that hasn't been varied is params[4]. In the examples, it's been -3.4, -2.4, -1.4. Maybe trying -4.4 (but that's within the range of -6.0). However, that's a new value. But in the examples, the user might have already tried that. Wait, the examples show params[4] as -3.4, -2.4, -1.4. So maybe trying -4.4 as a new value.

But the user's instruction says to use a search step size of 1.0 during exploration. So if the current value is -2.4, then exploring would be -2.4 ±1.0, which is -3.4 or -1.4. Those have been tried. So perhaps there's no need to explore further here.

Another parameter is params[6], which has been varied from -6.0 to -3.9. Maybe trying -2.9? But that's within the range. But in the examples, params[6] was -6.0, -5.9, -4.9, -3.9. So the next step would be -2.9, which hasn't been tried. But since the user is at iteration 30, maybe trying that.

But the user's instruction is to explore by using a step size of 1.0. However, since the previous examples have already tried varying params[6] by 1.0 steps, perhaps the next step is to change another parameter.

Alternatively, since the current examples have achieved 500.00, which is the maximum, maybe the best is to stick with the existing parameters. But the user's note says that if you're below 500, explore. But here, the examples are at 500. So perhaps the user is in a situation where they need to confirm that there's no higher value. However, given the problem statement, the maximum is around 500, so maybe it's safe to assume that 500 is the maximum.

But the user's instruction is to provide new params that haven't been seen before. So even if the current examples are at 500, the user needs to generate new params. Therefore, the next step is to perturb one of the parameters by 1.0 step in a direction that hasn't been explored yet.

For example, looking at params[7], which in the examples has been -1.1, -0.1, 0.9. The next step could be 1.9 (adding 1.0 to 0.9) or -2.1 (subtracting 1.0 from -1.1). But in the examples, those haven't been tried. So maybe changing params[7] to 1.9 or -2.1.

Alternatively, changing params[8] from 3.3 to 4.3 or 2.3. But 2.3 and 4.3 have been tried in the examples. For instance, in one example, params[8] was 2.3, and in another, 4.3. So that's already covered.

Another parameter is params[9], which in the examples has been 3.2, 4.2, 5.2. The next step could be 6.2 (but that's out of range) or 2.2. So 2.2 is within the range and hasn't been tried in the examples. So changing params[9] to 2.2.

But this is just a guess. The user's instruction is to explore with a step size of 1.0. So if the current value is, say, 4.2, then adding 1.0 would be 5.2 (already tried), subtracting 1.0 would be 3.2 (also tried). So maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, looking at params[8] which in some examples was 5.3. The next step would be 6.3 (invalid) or 4.3 (already tried). So that's not helpful.

Hmm. This is challenging because many parameters have already been explored. The user might need to make a small perturbation to one of the parameters that hasn't been varied much. For example, params[2] is 1.3 in most examples. Changing it to 2.3 (already tried) or 0.3 (already tried). So no new options there.

Wait, in the examples, params[5] was 1.9 and 2.9. Maybe changing it to 3.9? That's a step of +1.0 from 2.9. But that's a new value. So if we take the example where params[5] was 2.9 and the reward was 500.00, changing it to 3.9 would be a new parameter set.

Alternatively, looking at params[4], which was -2.4. Changing it to -3.4 (already tried) or -1.4 (also tried). So no new options.

Another parameter is params[6], which was -4.9. Changing it to -5.9 (already tried) or -3.9 (also tried). So no new options.

Hmm. Maybe the only parameter left is params[1], which is always 4.3. Changing it to 5.3 or 3.3. Let's try that. So, for example, changing params[1] to 5.3. Let's see what that would look like. The rest of the parameters would be the same as the ones that achieved 500.00. So:

params[0]: 3.2; params[1]: 5.3; params[2]: 1.3; params[3]: 4.6; params[4]: -2.4; params[5]: 1.9; params[6]: -4.9; params[7]: -0.1; params[8]: 3.3; params[9]: 4.2.

This is a new set of parameters not seen before. Since params[1] is changed from 4.3 to 5.3. That's a step of +1.0. This would be an exploration step. Even though the reward might be the same, it's a new parameter set.
