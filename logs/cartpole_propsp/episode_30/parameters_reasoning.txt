SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to improve my cartpole environment's policy using a linear policy network with 18 parameters. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward, which means keeping the pole upright and the cart within bounds as much as possible.

First, looking at the current params: they're all in the range of -6.0 to 6.0 with one decimal place. I see some examples where params[8] is -2.1 or -0.7, which are negative but not the most extreme values. The reward is around 37.95 at that point.

I remember that in policy optimization, we often use methods like PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) or A2C (Advantage Actor Critic). Since I'm using a linear policy, it's probably easier to adjust each parameter individually because the gradient might be straightforward to compute.

The user wants me to propose new params values. They mentioned that exploration should focus on both positive and negative directions with step size 1.0. So, maybe I can try increasing some parameters while decreasing others around their current values to see if they improve performance.

Looking at the current params, let's see which ones might have a bigger impact: W[0] (params[0], [2]), W[1] ([4], [6]), B (params[8], [9]). Maybe I should tweak params[3], [5], etc., which correspond to other positions in the state.

I notice that some param values are quite high or low, like 7.5 and -1.5. Since those don't seem optimal based on the examples provided, maybe adjusting them could help.

Also, considering the reward structure: +1 per time step for keeping things stable. It's a small positive reward, so any significant improvement in maintaining balance would be crucial.

Maybe I should focus on making some parameters more negative or positive where they currently have higher rewards. For instance, if params[3] is 5.5 and the action [0: left, 1: right], then increasing it might push the cart further, which could cause instability. But since W[2] (params[4]) is -3.9, perhaps adjusting this could help.

Wait, in the reward function, only when pole is upright and cart within bounds, we get a +1. So maybe decreasing the chance of hitting the boundaries or unstable states could increase the reward.

Alternatively, if I can make params[5] (pole angular velocity) more negative, that might make it harder to balance, which would penalize the reward but perhaps lead to safer actions towards the center, increasing overall reward in terms of keeping things upright.

I should also consider the interaction between parameters. For example, changing W[0] could affect how the state is transformed into action, so adjusting multiple params at once might yield better results.

Another thought: maybe some parameters are redundant or don't contribute significantly to the policy's value function. I can ignore them by setting their values to 0 and see if that improves performance without affecting stability too much.

Looking back at the examples provided, the best reward is around 99.00, so I need to find a balance between exploration (trying out new parameters) and exploitation (relying on good parameters). Since the step size for exploration is fixed at 1.0, I might have to use some form of random sampling or grid search within that range.

I should also consider how each parameter affects the policy. For instance, increasing params[0] could make the cart start moving more, which might be dangerous if it goes beyond bounds. But since the current reward is based on being upright and near the center, maybe focusing on parameters that stabilize the pole while keeping the cart in bounds would be better.

I think I'll try tweaking some of the higher values down towards 5.5 or 4.5 to see if that stabilizes the system more effectively. Also, perhaps lowering params[1], [3], etc., could help with overreacting to certain state changes, leading to safer actions.

Additionally, since the policy is linear, each parameter's contribution can be analyzed individually based on their gradients. If I compute the gradient of the reward function with respect to each param, adjusting them in the direction that increases the gradient should improve performance. But doing this manually would be time-consuming and might not lead me directly to the optimal solution.

Instead, perhaps a more hands-on approach is better. Let's try modifying some params slightly around their current values and see how it affects the reward. For example:

- Increase params[0] from 4.5 to 5.5
- Decrease params[1] from -3.9 to -2.5 (lowering the cart velocity)
- Lower params[2] from -1.8 to -1.5
- Increase params[3] from 3.7 to 5.5
- Keep params[4], [6], [7], [8], and [9] as they are.

This adjustment should test whether increasing some parameters (like pushing the cart further) while decreasing others (like slowing down velocity and angular speed) improves the balance without causing the pole to fall over.

After making these changes, I'll run a few iterations of training. If the reward increases significantly or stabilizes better than before, this approach is worth keeping. If not, maybe more aggressive adjustments or different parameter ranges are needed.

In summary, my plan is to adjust some parameters slightly around their current values, focusing on the state's velocity and pole-related factors, to see if they can improve the cartpole environment's performance while staying within the allowed range of -6.0 to 6.0 for each param.
