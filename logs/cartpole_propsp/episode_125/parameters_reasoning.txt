SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 125 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.

<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to help this cartpole environment optimization problem. The goal is to find the global optimal policy by interacting with the system and adjusting the parameters of a linear policy. Let me break down how I'd approach this.

First, I understand that the state space consists of four elements: cart position, cart velocity, pole angle, and pole angular velocity. The action space has two options: push left or push right. The reward function gives +1 for each time step the pole is upright and within bounds; otherwise, it's zero.

I'm given that after 300 iterations, the best params have a reward of around 266.60. My task is to propose new params values aiming for higher rewards, up to 500. The challenge here is balancing exploration with exploitation without knowing where the maximum is yet.

Looking at the provided params and their rewards, I notice that some parameters yield high rewards (like params[0] = -5 and [1]=-2.4) but others perform worse. For instance, params[3] = 0.7 gives a reward of about 266.60, while higher values like 0.8 or even positive numbers aren't as effective.

I also see that parameters with negative pole angles (like [2]=-1.5 and [6]=-1.5) might be better for keeping the pole upright. However, if these are set too high, the cart could move out of bounds, which would hurt the reward.

Another consideration is the cart velocity parameter [1]. Setting it to -2.4 resulted in a good reward, but perhaps adjusting this could improve performance.

I think I should try parameters that have negative pole angles and adjust others to either increase or decrease their values. Maybe starting with [0]=-5, [1]=-2.4, [2]=-1.8, [3]=0.7, [4]=-3.9, [5]=1.1, [6]=-1.5, [7]=4.1, [8]=-2.1, and see how that performs.

After setting these, I'll run the simulation for a few more iterations to observe how the reward changes. If the reward increases, I can continue with similar strategies. But if it fluctuates or decreases, I might need to tweak other parameters like [3], [7], or [9].

It's important to note that without knowing where exactly the maximum reward is, I'm focusing on areas where promising results have been achieved. This approach should help me converge towards a good policy without getting stuck in local optima.
