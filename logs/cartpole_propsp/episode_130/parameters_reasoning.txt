SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help find the optimal policy for the cartpole environment using a linear policy optimizer. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward f(params), where params are the policy parameters.

First, I understand that the current approach uses gradient ascent on the episodic reward function with a certain learning rate. It's been running for 130 iterations and has given me several reward values. From what I see in the results, when I set all params to -5.0, I get an average reward of around 266 points. But there are other configurations that yield higher rewards, like when some parameters are positive or adjusted.

I'm thinking about why certain parameter values work better. For instance, having a more balanced distribution of positive and negative parameters seems beneficial because it might help the policy explore both directions in action space. The current approach uses a fixed learning rate; maybe lowering the learning rate could let the optimizer converge more precisely to a maximum by giving each step enough weight.

Another point is that sometimes adding noise or exploration strategies can help find better optima, especially if the reward landscape has multiple local maxima. Perhaps adjusting the variance of the policy, like using an exploration bonus in addition to the gradient ascent, could push the optimizer out of local optima and towards a higher reward.

Looking at the current setup, I see that after each iteration, the reward decreases. That might be because the learning rate is too high for some parameter values, causing oscillations or slow convergence. Lowering the learning rate by 0.1 (from 0.1 to 0.09) should make each step in the gradient ascent more significant relative to the current loss, which could help stabilize training.

I also notice that some reward values are lower than others, especially in later iterations. This might indicate that the optimizer is getting stuck near certain optima rather than escaping them and finding a better solution. Implementing strategies like temperature scaling or adjusting learning rates dynamically based on experience could address this by allowing the model to escape local optima.

Another consideration is whether using an adaptive learning rate (like RMSprop or Adam) would be beneficial. These methods adjust the learning rate per parameter, which can help in navigating the loss landscape more effectively than a fixed approach.

Additionally, the number of steps used for gradient estimation is 15 per iteration with noise added. If this batch size isn't sufficient to capture the true gradient, it might lead to unstable training or not converge properly. Perhaps increasing the batch size could provide better estimates and help find the optimal policy.

I also need to ensure that the exploration policies are set up correctly. Using an epsilon-greedy approach might be too strict in some cases, leading to either over-exploration without enough guidance or under-exploration where certain parameters aren't sufficiently varied. Maybe a more adaptive exploration strategy based on the current loss could help.

Lastly, I should also think about whether any parameter normalization or standardization is needed before applying gradient ascent. Normalizing the parameters so that each has zero mean and unit variance could help in training the optimizer more effectively by avoiding issues with varying scales among parameters.

Putting this all together, my plan is to lower the learning rate from 0.1 to 0.09, adjust any other components of the gradient descent method as needed, perhaps experimenting with different batch sizes for the gradients, and refining the exploration strategy based on the observed reward values. This should help in finding a more robust and optimal set of parameters.
