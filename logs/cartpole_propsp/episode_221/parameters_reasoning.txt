SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 221 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to find the global optimal policy for the cartpole environment. The user mentioned that the goal is around 500 iterations, but they're at iteration 221 with a reward of about 72.25. That's not great because a higher reward would be better.

First, I remember that the reward is +1 every time the pole stays upright and the cart isn't off-bounds. So, the episode ends when either the pole tips over or the cart goes beyond its bounds. The goal is to maximize this reward, so we want the pole to stay balanced as long as possible.

I see that there are 10 parameters in the linear policy. Each parameter can be adjusted between -6 and 6. The current parameters give a low reward of around 72, which isn't great because the goal is to get higher rewards. 

The next step is to explore these parameters by changing some values slightly while keeping others fixed. Since the exploration should use a step size of 1.0, I can increment or decrement certain parameters and see how it affects the reward.

Looking at the top performing params in the recent data, they have varying combinations. For example, params[0] is -5.2, [1]:6, etc. Maybe trying some extremes could help. If I set params[0] to -6 or 6, would that improve the reward?

I also notice that some parameters are higher than others. For instance, params[3] is always -1 in most top performers. That might be tricky because if it's too negative, it could make the cart move too much, which is bad for balancing.

Perhaps I should try increasing certain parameters to see their effects. Like, if I set [0]:6 and [4]: something else, would that improve balance? Or maybe setting some to lower values but not too low?

I'm also thinking about how action affects the state. The policy uses a linear function of state @ W + B. Changing W and B could change the action distribution. Maybe adjusting W in such a way that certain actions lead to better pole balancing.

Another idea is to check if the current parameters are near optimal. If I can find an improvement, maybe by increasing some positive weights or decreasing negative ones, it could lead to higher rewards.

I should also consider the exploration strategy. Since I'm using 1 as the step size, perhaps randomly trying different combinations within the parameter range will help explore without missing any better options.

Finally, after each iteration, I'll note down how the reward changes and adjust my search accordingly. If a new param set gives a higher reward, it's worth keeping; if not, maybe revert and try others.
