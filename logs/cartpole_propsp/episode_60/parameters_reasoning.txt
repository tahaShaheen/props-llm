SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 60 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to optimize the parameters for a linear policy in the CartPole environment. They've given me a bunch of previous parameter sets and their corresponding rewards. My job is to figure out the next set of parameters to try, aiming for a higher reward, especially since the global optimum is supposed to be around 500.

Looking at the examples, the top rewards are around 428, but that's still below 500. So, maybe the current parameters aren't exploring enough. The user mentioned that during exploration, a step size of 1.0 should be used. So, I need to make sure that the parameters I suggest are varying enough from previous ones, not just tweaking small values.

Looking at the parameters, the first few entries (params[0], params[1], etc.) have values like 6, 1.3, -3, 6, etc. Some of them are at the upper or lower bounds (-6 to 6). Maybe pushing some parameters further, but within the allowed range. However, since the step size is 1.0, I need to adjust parameters by 1.0 from their current values. Wait, but the previous examples have some parameters already at 6 or -6. So, maybe I can't go beyond that. But perhaps adjusting other parameters that haven't been explored as much.

Looking at the current top parameters, params[2] is often -3, but maybe trying -4 or -2. However, some of the previous attempts with -4 (like in params[2] = -4) resulted in lower rewards. So maybe that's not the way. Alternatively, looking at params[4] and params[5], which are around 5.3 and 2.7. Maybe increasing params[4] to 6.3? But the range is up to 6.0, so that's not allowed. So, maybe adjusting params[4] to 6.0 and see.

Wait, the parameters are constrained between -6.0 and 6.0 with one decimal place. So, I can't go beyond that. So, perhaps looking for parameters that are in the middle of the range. For example, some of the parameters are set to 6.0, which is the maximum. Maybe reducing some of those to 5.0 and increasing others. But how?

Alternatively, looking at the B terms (params[8] and params[9]). In the top examples, they are often 6.0. Maybe adjusting those to lower values. But I'm not sure. The policy is action = argmax(state @ W + B). So, the B is the bias term. If B is high, maybe that's making the action selection more biased towards one direction. But without knowing the exact impact, it's hard to say.

Another approach is to check which parameters haven't been varied much. For example, params[3] is often 6.0. Maybe trying 5.0 or 7.0 (but 7.0 is beyond the limit). So, 5.0. Similarly, params[6] is often -6.0. Maybe trying -5.0. But how does that affect the reward?

Also, looking at the previous attempts, some parameters like params[2] have been tried at -3, -2, -4. Maybe trying -1.0? But that's a big jump. However, the step size is 1.0, so maybe that's allowed. Wait, the step size is for exploration, but the parameters can be adjusted by 1.0 from their current values. But if the previous parameters were at -3, then adding or subtracting 1.0 would be -4 or -2. But those have already been tried. So maybe looking for other parameters that haven't been explored as much.

Looking at params[7], in some examples it's 6.0, in others 5.0. Maybe trying 6.0 again. Not sure. Alternatively, looking at params[4], which is 5.3 in some cases. Maybe increasing to 6.0, but that's already tried in some examples. For example, in the first example, params[4] is 5.3, but in another, it's 6.0. Wait, no, looking back, the first example has params[4] as 5.3, but in another example, params[4] is 6.0. Wait, no, in the example with f(params): 379.45, params[4] is 6.0. So maybe that's a possibility.

But how to choose which parameters to adjust? Since the user mentioned that if we're below 500, we should explore instead of exploit. So, even if some parameters seem to be working, we need to explore new areas. For example, changing some parameters that have been set to extremes (like 6.0 or -6.0) to something else, even if that's a big step.

Another idea: check which parameters are not at the extremes. For example, params[1] is often 1.3. Maybe trying 2.3 or 0.3. But in some examples, they've tried 0.3 and 2.3. For instance, in the example with params[1]: 0.3, the reward was lower. But maybe adjusting other parameters.

Alternatively, looking at the B terms. In the top examples, B is often 6.0. Maybe reducing that to 5.0 or 4.0. But again, without knowing the impact, it's hard to tell.

Perhaps the best approach is to take one of the previous parameters and make a significant change to one of the parameters, ensuring that it's not the same as any previous ones. For example, take the first example where params[0] is 6, params[1] 1.3, params[2] -3, etc. Maybe change params[2] from -3 to -4 (but that was tried before with lower reward). Alternatively, change params[3] from 6 to 5.0. Let's try that.

So, modifying params[3] from 6.0 to 5.0. Let's see. The previous example with params[3] as 5.0 had lower rewards. But maybe combining that with other changes. For example, changing params[3] to 5.0 and also adjusting params[6] from -6 to -5.0. That way, we're making two changes, which might lead to a better exploration.

Alternatively, take a parameter that's been set to 6.0 and lower it. For example, params[0] is 6.0 in many examples. Maybe set it to 5.0. But that might be a step in the right direction. Let's try that.

But how to ensure that this new parameter set hasn't been tried before. The user mentioned not to propose previously seen params. So, need to check if the new set is unique. However, since the user hasn't provided all previous attempts, I have to assume that the new set is different. But given the examples, I need to make sure that the new parameters aren't exactly the same as any in the examples.

For example, in the first example, params are [6,1.3,-3,6,5.3,2.7,-6,6,6,6]. If I change params[0] to 5.0, that's a new set. Let's try that. So:

params[0]: 5.0, params[1]: 1.3, params[2]: -3, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 5.3, params[5]: 2.7, params[6]: -6, params[7]: 6, params[8]: 6, params[9]: 6. But wait, this is similar to the example where params[0] was 5.0 and the reward was 397.95. So that's already tried. So, that's not allowed.

Hmm. Need to find a new combination. Let's think. Maybe change params[2] from -3 to -2. But that was tried in some examples. For example, in one of the examples, params[2] is -2 and the reward was 404.95. But that's lower than the top ones. So, maybe changing other parameters.

What about changing params[4] from 5.3 to 6.0? Wait, in one example, params[4] was 6.0 and the reward was 379.45. So that's already tried. Not helpful.

Alternatively, change params[5] from 2.7 to 3.7. Wait, in one of the examples, params[5] was 3.7 and the reward was 426.55. So that's already tried. So, that's not new.

Hmm. Maybe changing params[7] from 6 to 5.0. Let's see. For example, take the first example and change params[7] to 5.0. So:

params[0]:6, params[1]:1.3, params[2▍

</think>

params[0]: 6.0, params[1]: 2.3, params[2]: -3.0, params[3]: 6.0, params[4]: 6.0, params[5]: 3.7, params[6]: -5.0, params[7]: 6.0, params[8]: 5.0, params[9]: 6.0
