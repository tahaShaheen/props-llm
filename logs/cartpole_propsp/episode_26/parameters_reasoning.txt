SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

Now you are at iteration 26 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how to set up the parameters for this cartpole environment. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.

First, the cartpole environment is a simulation where a pole attached to a cart needs to stay upright without falling over. The state of the system includes the cart's position, velocity, pole angle, and angular velocity. The action space has two options: pushing left or right.

The policy I'm using is linear, which means the action is determined by multiplying the state vector with the weights (matrix W) and adding biases (vector B). So f(params) = sum(state_i * W_ij + B_j for all i and j).

I've seen some examples where different parameters give different rewards. The reward is +1 every time step the pole stays upright and cart is within bounds. Otherwise, it's 0.

The goal is to maximize this reward over many steps (the episode length). From the example data provided, when params are set to a certain range, the reward can be around 80 or even higher. But we want to reach around 500, which is higher than the maximum seen in these examples. That suggests that with better parameters, the reward should increase.

Looking at the example values:

- When params are [-3.6, 0.4, -5.4, -3.3], the reward is 88.35.
- Another set where all params are around -6 to +6 gives a higher reward of ~80.
- There's an instance with 53.00, which is lower.

So maybe increasing some parameters can make the pole more stable, leading to higher rewards.

But wait, if W has negative values and B has positive ones, that might allow the pole to stay upright longer when pushing left or right. So perhaps making some actions better than others could help.

Let me think about how each parameter affects the system. For example:

- params[0] (cart position) is being multiplied by all weights. If I make it a higher positive number, that might increase the action taken for positions where the pole can be balanced better.

But pushing too far left or right could cause the cart to move beyond the safe bounds (-2.4 to 2.4). That would end the episode prematurely if not handled properly.

Similarly, params[1] (cart velocity) and params[3] (pole angular velocity) influence how quickly things change, which affects balancing time.

The pole's initial angle is in params[2], so perhaps making that a bit more upright can help. But if it's too low or high, it could fall over.

I think the key is to adjust W and B such that when you apply either action (push left or push right), the system stays balanced longer on average.

Maybe starting with a range of params where they are all within -6 to 6 but not too extreme. For example:

params = [-3, 0.5, -4, -2]

This should allow each parameter to vary slightly without causing immediate issues. Then I can tweak them based on the rewards seen.

Alternatively, since higher reward is better, perhaps increasing some params like params[0], params[1], and params[3] could help, but not too much as that might destabilize the cart or pole.

I should also consider how the state transitions when applying each action. For example, if pushing left (action 0) leads to a higher reward on average compared to pushing right (action 1), then perhaps W and B need to be adjusted accordingly.

But since I'm only supposed to set the params, maybe starting in the middle of their ranges is better: [-3.6, -3.6, -3.4, -3.6]. That would keep each parameter around -3.5 to -3.7, which seems balanced and avoids extreme values that might lead to immediate episode termination.

This setup should allow the system to have enough time to stabilize without making it too difficult or easy at any point.
