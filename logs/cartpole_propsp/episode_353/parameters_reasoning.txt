SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to find the optimal policy for the cartpole environment using reinforcement learning. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward, which rewards each time step where the pole is upright and the cart is within bounds.

First, I need to understand the current state of my parameters. From the examples provided, it seems that some parameter combinations yield a high reward (like 500), while others don't perform as well. The goal is to find which set of parameters—within the specified range—gives the highest reward.

Since the policy is linear with 18 parameters, I can adjust these values between -6 and 6, including one decimal place. My initial plan is to use a grid search approach, adjusting each parameter step by step. However, manually adjusting all ten parameters would be time-consuming and error-prone. Instead, I should systematically explore the parameter space.

I'll start by varying one parameter at a time while keeping others fixed to see how it affects the reward. For instance, I can adjust params[0] from -6 to 6 in increments of 1.0, then evaluate f(params) each time. This method will help me identify which parameters are most influential on the reward.

Once one parameter is fully optimized, I'll move on to the next and repeat until all ten parameters are fine-tuned. It's important to keep track of the best reward achieved during this process so far. If a new combination gives a higher reward than any previously found, it becomes my current best.

Additionally, I should consider symmetries in the parameter space. For example, flipping params[0] and params[1] (since they are parameters 0 and 1) might not change the outcome if they're set symmetrically. This knowledge can reduce the number of unique parameter combinations I need to test.

I also realize that sometimes a slightly suboptimal parameter set could lead to better overall performance because of interactions between parameters. So, it's crucial to thoroughly explore each dimension without getting stuck in local optima.

Finally, after systematically testing all parameters and identifying the one set that yields the highest reward, I can present this as my optimal solution.
