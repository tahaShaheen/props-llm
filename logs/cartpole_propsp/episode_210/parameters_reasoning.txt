SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.
params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5; f(params): 500.00
params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -4; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5; f(params): 499.95
params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 4.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5; f(params): 499.35
params[0]: 6; params[1]: 1.3; params[2]: -6; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 6; params[9]: 6; f(params): 497.35
params[0]: 5; params[1]: 1.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 5; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -5; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 6; params[9]: 6; f(params): 497.15
params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 6; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5; f(params): 426.55
params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -4; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 6; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -5; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 6; params[9]: 6; f(params): 482.30
params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 6; params[9]: 5; f(params): 348.85


Now you are at iteration 210 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is working on optimizing the parameters for a linear policy in the CartPole environment. They've provided some training examples and the current iteration is 210 out of 400. The goal is to reach the global optimum around 500, but they're currently at 210, so they need to explore more.

Looking at the examples, the highest reward so far is 500.00 with certain parameters. But the user wants to avoid local optima and explore more. The instructions mention using a search step size of 1.0 during exploration. 

The current top parameters have some patterns. For instance, params[0], [1], [3], [5], [7], [8], [9] are often around 6, 2.3, 6, 6, 6, 5, 5. But there's variation in params[2], [4], [6]. For example, params[2] is -5 or -6, params[4] is 5.3 or 6, and params[6] is -6 or -5.

Since the user wants to explore, maybe I should perturb some parameters that are near the edges of the range. Let's check which parameters could be adjusted. For example, in the highest reward example, params[4] is 5.3. Maybe increasing that to 6.0 could help, but that's already in some examples. Alternatively, maybe decreasing some of the higher values.

Wait, the current highest is 500.00. But the user says the global optimum is around 500, so perhaps that's the maximum, but maybe there's a way to get even higher. However, the examples show that when they tried params[4] as 6, the reward dropped. So maybe the optimal is indeed around 500, but the user is aiming to confirm that.

Alternatively, maybe there are other parameters that haven't been explored enough. For instance, looking at params[2], which is -5 in the top example. What if we try -4.5 or -5.5? But the step size is 1.0, so maybe changing it by 1.0. Let's see.

Another approach: since the user wants to explore, perhaps changing some parameters that are at the extremes. For example, in the current top example, params[8] and [9] are 5.0. Maybe increasing them to 6.0, but that's already in some examples. Alternatively, decreasing them.

Wait, the user mentioned that during exploration, the step size is 1.0. So, for each parameter, we can add or subtract 1.0 from the current value. Let's look at the current top parameters and see which ones could be adjusted.

Looking at the first example with reward 500.00:
params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5.

If we increase params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3 (but wait, the allowed range is [-6.0, 6.0], so 6.0 is the max. So maybe 6.0. But in some examples, when params[4] was 6, the reward dropped. So maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, adjust params[2] from -5 to -6. But in another example, when params[2] was -6, the reward was lower (like 497.35). Hmm.

What about params[8] and [9]? They are 5 in the top example. If we increase them to 6, but in some examples, that led to lower rewards. For instance, in the example where params[8] and [9] were 6, the reward was 348.85. That's much lower. So maybe that's not good.

Alternatively, looking at params[6], which is -6. If we change that to -5. But in another example, when params[6] was -5, the reward was 482.30, which is lower than 500. So that's worse.

Hmm. Maybe looking for other parameters. Let's check params[1] is 2.3. If we increase it to 3.3, but that's outside the allowed range? No, the range is up to 6.0. So 3.3 is allowed. But the user's instruction says to use a step size of 1.0 during exploration. So maybe changing params[1] from 2.3 to 3.3 or 1.3.

Wait, the user's instruction says during exploration, use a search step size of 1.0. So for each parameter, we can add or subtract 1.0. So for example, if a parameter is at 2.3, we can try 3.3 or 1.3. Let's see.

In the current top example, params[1] is 2.3. Trying 3.3. Maybe that could lead to higher reward. Let's try changing params[1] from 2.3 to 3.3, keeping others the same. But I need to make sure that I'm not repeating previous params. Looking at the examples, there's one where params[1] is 1.3, but not 3.3. So that's a new value.

Alternatively, change params[2] from -5 to -4. But in another example, when params[2] was -4, the reward was 499.95, which is slightly lower than 500. So maybe not helpful.

Another parameter: params[4] is 5.3. If we decrease it by 1.0 to 4.3. But in an example, when params[4] was 4.3, the reward was 499.35. That's lower than 500.

What about params[8] and [9] being 5.0. If we increase them to 6.0, but that led to lower rewards in some examples. However, maybe there's a combination where other parameters are adjusted.

Alternatively, maybe changing params[0] from 6.0 to 5.0. Let's see. In one example, when params[0] was 5, the reward was 497.15. Lower than 500.

Hmm. So the current top is 500.00. To explore, maybe try changing one of the parameters that's not at the extremes. For example, params[1] is 2.3. Let's try increasing it by 1.0 to 3.3. Let's check if that's a new param. Looking at the examples provided, none have params[1] as 3.3. So that's a new one.

So the new params would be:

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 3.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5.

This is a new set of parameters not seen before. Let's try that. The step size is 1.0 for exploration, so changing params[1] from 2.3 to 3.3 is a step of +1.0.

Alternatively, maybe changing params[2] from -5 to -6. But in another example, when params[2] was -6, the reward was 497.35. Lower than 500. So maybe not helpful.

Another option: change params[6] from -6 to -5. But that led to lower rewards in some examples.

Alternatively, change params[7] from 6 to 5. But in the current top example, params[7] is 6. So changing to 5 might lower the reward.

Hmm. Maybe the best exploration move is to adjust params[1] to 3.3. Let's go with that.
