SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to get the global optimal policy for the cartpole environment using this linear policy approach. The user mentioned that each parameter is a float with one decimal place between -6 and 6. They've provided several examples of parameters and their corresponding episodic rewards.

First, I understand that the goal is to maximize the reward, which is +1 each time the pole stays upright and the cart is within bounds. The reward decreases if the pole falls over or the cart goes out of its allowed positions. So, a higher reward (episodic reward f(params)) would indicate better performance.

The user's strategy is to test multiple parameters in each iteration until reaching 400 steps. They've given me some examples where they have f(params) around 397-450 points. The global optimum is supposed to be around 500, which suggests that the current setup might not be sufficient without more exploration.

I'm thinking about how to approach this systematically. Since it's a linear policy, each parameter contributes positively or negatively to the action taken. Parameters are coefficients in the linear function of state, so adjusting them can change the policy's behavior.

I should consider using a method that explores different parameter values around the current ones, evaluating each set of parameters and tracking their rewards. This way, I can see if moving towards higher reward areas leads to better performance.

One strategy is to use random search within the given parameter ranges. I'll randomly sample new parameter sets and compute their rewards. If a new set yields a higher reward than the current best, it's worth exploring further. This approach is systematic and doesn't rely on any prior knowledge of where the maximum lies.

I need to ensure that each sampled parameter meets the range constraints (-6.0 to 6.0). It's also important to maintain uniqueness in the sampled parameters to avoid redundant computations or overfitting.

Additionally, I should consider how many iterations are needed for this method to converge. Since they're only at iteration 210 and haven't reached the desired reward yet, more exploration might be required. But since the policy is a linear function with 8 parameters (wait, wait—no, params in the user's code are f(params) as a result of action = argmax(state @ W + B), where state has 4 elements and W is 18 parameters? Wait, no—the initial description says that the policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters. So each parameter is separate. But the user mentioned params[0] to [9], which are part of the weight matrix W in their code.

Wait, actually, looking back, the action is computed as argmax(state @ W + B). So W is a matrix where each row corresponds to an action (0 or 1), and B is the bias term. So if there are two actions, W will have two rows, each with four elements. That means in their code, params represent both the weights and biases. But in the problem description, the user says that f(params) is the episodic reward function.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify: The policy is a linear policy where the action is determined by a linear combination of the state vector plus a bias term, passed through an argmax to choose between two actions (push left or push right). So the parameters are in W and B. But the problem statement mentioned that f(params) is the episodic reward function.

Wait, perhaps there's confusion here. The user provided their own code structure where params contain both weights and biases for each action. But they're trying to find a global optimal policy using a linear approach with 18 parameters—probably W and B for each action? Or maybe it's just the linear part with multiple parameters.

Wait, no, looking back: The user wrote that the policy is f(params) = argmax(state @ W + B). So if there are two actions (0 and 1), then W would be a matrix of size [2 x 4] where each row corresponds to an action. So for two actions, each with four parameters in W. Then B would be a vector of size 2. But the user says that params is an array of 10 float numbers. Wait, that doesn't add up because for two actions, you need two rows and two columns—so that's 4 + 2 = 6 parameters, but the user said it's 10. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps W is a 18-dimensional vector? Because in their code, f(params) = argmax(state @ W + B), where state is [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity], and params are the weights W and biases B. Let me count: state has four elements, so W is a matrix of size (number_of_actions x 4). For two actions, that's 2x4=8 parameters for W. Then B is a vector of size 2, so 2 parameters. So total params would be 10? Oh, because 8 + 2 = 10. That makes sense.

So each parameter in the user's code corresponds to either a weight in W or the bias term B. Therefore, when the user asks for "params[0]: , ...", they're asking about all 10 parameters of the linear policy: 8 weights and 2 biases.

The goal is to find the set of these 10 parameters that maximizes the episodic reward over multiple episodes. The current exploration has not yet found this optimal point, so more testing is needed.

Given that, I can propose a new strategy where I randomly sample parameter values within the given ranges and evaluate their performance. This will allow me to explore different combinations of W (weights) and B (biases) to find the one that maximizes the reward.

I should start by sampling new parameters around the current best ones to see if moving in the direction of higher rewards is possible. It's also important to maintain a balance between exploring new areas and not getting stuck in local optima, as some methods can converge too quickly.

Since each parameter is bounded between -6 and 6 with one decimal place, I have 12 options for cart_position (-6 to 6, inclusive), but practically only from -inf to inf—wait, no, the user has specified params[0] can be -6.0 as a lower bound, but in their examples, it seems they're sampling from within that range.

Wait, looking back: The user provided parameters like params[0]: -6; others with varying decimals. So each parameter is sampled from this grid of values. Therefore, to explore beyond the current best, I can adjust some parameters slightly and see if it improves performance.

But considering the time constraints (400 steps), perhaps a more efficient method is needed. Another approach could be using reinforcement learning techniques like Q-learning or SARSA with epsilon-greedy exploration, but since this is a policy-based approach, maybe policy gradient methods are better suited here.

However, given the complexity of the cartpole environment and the linear nature of the policy being considered, perhaps a more systematic random search within parameter bounds is manageable. Each iteration, I'll generate a new set of parameters within [-6.0, 6.0] for each of the 10 W/B pairs and evaluate the reward.

This way, if moving in certain directions leads to higher rewards, I can adjust those parameters accordingly. If not, I might need to explore other regions. It's important to ensure that the sampling is thorough but efficient, perhaps using a grid or random sampling within the ranges.

I should also consider stopping after a certain number of iterations (like 100) and track which parameter sets are performing best, then focus on those for the remaining steps. Alternatively, if I don't have enough iterations left to thoroughly explore all combinations, I might settle with the highest reward found so far.

In summary, my approach will be:

1. For each iteration (up to 400):
   a. Randomly sample new parameter values within [-6.0, 6.0].
   b. Compute f(params) for this set.
   c. If it's higher than the current best, update and continue exploring nearby areas.
   d. If not, keep or explore other regions based on feedback.

This method should allow me to systematically explore the parameter space and potentially find the global optimum around 500 reward points as per the user's expectations.
