SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 248 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.

<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to help improve the parameters of my cartpole environment's policy in the Cartpole environment on a 2D world. The goal is to balance the pole and keep the cart within certain bounds while maximizing the reward.

So, from what I understand, each iteration, I can choose a set of parameters for my linear policy and get an episodic reward. My task is to find the optimal parameters that yield the highest possible reward over multiple steps. The goal here seems to be around 500, which means it's looking for a state where the reward isn't just slightly above zero but significantly higher than in previous iterations.

Looking at the parameters provided, each one has values with up to one decimal place, ranging from -6.0 to 6.0. They are divided into two parts: W and B. The W matrix has 18 parameters arranged in a specific structure, and B is another vector of four parameters (params[0] to params[3]).

The user's current example shows that the policy doesn't have explored new parameter values beyond what was already seen before. They might be on a local optimum or just exploiting the existing good parameters without much improvement.

My approach should focus on exploration, searching both positive and negative directions around the current best parameters to see if I can find a better reward. Since we're in a 4-dimensional space (params[0] to params[3]), I'll need to systematically test different values within reasonable ranges.

I think using an epsilon greedy strategy could work here. That is, explore randomly for a certain percentage of iterations while exploiting the best parameters found so far. This balances exploration and maximization.

But before diving into that, I should consider how to structure my search. Maybe perform small random changes around each current parameter and see if any combination gives a higher reward than before. If not, proceed to more drastic adjustments. It's also important to keep track of the best reward encountered so far in different regions to avoid getting stuck.

I need to be careful not to just randomly tweak parameters but to methodically explore different combinations. Since each parameter can vary from -6.0 to 6.0 with one decimal place, there are several possibilities for each (18 in W and 4 in B). A thorough search would involve testing each possible combination within the allowed range.

I should also monitor the performance of each new set of parameters after each iteration. If a new parameter set yields a higher reward than the current best, update the best parameters and keep track of how many iterations it takes to reach that point.

Additionally, I can record the reward at each step for different regions (e.g., where params[0] is high or low) to see if certain ranges are consistently better. This might help in identifying which parameter ranges are worth exploring further.

I'll have to be methodical about this process, checking and updating my records as I go. It's a bit time-consuming, but it should lead me toward the global optimum rather than just getting stuck on local optima.
