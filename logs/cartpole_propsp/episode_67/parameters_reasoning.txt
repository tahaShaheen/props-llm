SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to help this user with their cartpole environment problem. They mentioned they're looking for the global optimal policy using a linear policy with 18 parameters. The reward function is positive when the pole is upright and the cart is within bounds.

First, I remember that in reinforcement learning, a linear policy takes the state as input and outputs an action based on linear weights. Here, the state has four elements: position, velocity, angle, and angular velocity. So the policy matrix W has 18 parameters because for each of the two actions (left or right), you have 4 parameters multiplied by 2 actions.

The user is asking how to maximize f(params) without previously seen params. They want to try a bunch of examples with different parameter values, up to four digits after the decimal point. So I should suggest a systematic way to explore this parameter space. Maybe start from an initial point and make small increments around it.

They also mention that during exploration, use a search step size of 1.0. That means each parameter can be adjusted by ±1 in their range. But the params are between -6.0 and 6.0, so I need to ensure I don't go beyond these limits.

Looking at the examples provided, the best reward was around 99.55, achieved with various combinations. So perhaps starting from one of those top parameters could lead us towards a better solution. But since it's an exploration phase, not exploitation yet, maybe focus on getting more data points in promising regions first.

I should also consider using an exploration strategy like Gaussian or uniform distributions to cover the parameter space thoroughly. Maybe start with initial points and gradually refine them based on rewards.

Additionally, I need to ensure that each params[0] through params[9] is between -6.0 and 6.0 as specified. Also, since it's a linear function of parameters, the reward should be smooth across the parameter space, making exploration easier without getting stuck in local optima.

Perhaps using Bayesian optimization or other global optimization methods could help, but I think for this problem, systematic random sampling within each parameter's range would work better to cover possible optimal points.

So, putting it all together, suggest an initial point near one of the top reward examples and then systematically explore nearby values in each dimension. This way, we can gather enough data to identify any potential global optimum without getting stuck too early.
