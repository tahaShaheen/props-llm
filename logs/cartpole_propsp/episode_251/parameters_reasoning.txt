SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.
params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5; f(params): 500.00
params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5; f(params): 500.00
params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -4; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5; f(params): 499.95
params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 4.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5; f(params): 499.35
params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -5; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5; f(params): 498.55
params[0]: 6; params[1]: 1.3; params[2]: -6; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 6; params[9]: 6; f(params): 497.35
params[0]: 5; params[1]: 1.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 5; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -5; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 6; params[9]: 6; f(params): 497.15
params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 5; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5; f(params): 475.30
params[0]: 6; params[1]: 3.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5; f(params): 385.35
params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 6; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5; f(params): 446.65


Now you are at iteration 251 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.

---
WARNING: This is attempt 2 out of 10. You have FAILED 1 times already. You have 8 attempts remaining. MAKE SURE THE FORMAT IS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT: 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, ...' with all values in range [-6.0, 6.0]. If you fail again, the entire episode will be discarded.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to optimize the parameters for a linear policy in the CartPole environment. They've provided some examples of previous parameters and their corresponding rewards. The goal is to reach a high episodic reward, ideally around 500. The current iteration is 251 out of 400, and they've already failed once, so I need to be careful with the format.

Looking at the examples, the top-performing parameters have values like 6, 5.3, -5, etc. The ones that gave 500.00 had params[0] and [3] as 6, params[2] and [6] as -5 and -6 respectively. The bias terms (params[8] and [9]) were around 5. 

But the user mentioned that if the current reward is below 500, they should explore instead of exploit. The examples show that some parameters with slight variations (like changing params[1] from 2.3 to 1.3 or 3.3) resulted in lower rewards. So maybe the optimal parameters are in the vicinity of the ones that achieved 500. However, the user wants to avoid local optima and explore more.

Since the current iteration is 251, and there are 400 steps, there's still time to explore. The user suggested using a search step size of 1.0 during exploration. So perhaps I should perturb some of the parameters that are near the top performers but haven't been tried yet. For example, looking at params[7], in the top examples it's 6, but maybe trying 5 or 7 (though 7 is out of range). Wait, parameters must be between -6.0 and 6.0. So maybe decrease params[7] from 6 to 5. 

Another parameter that might be worth changing is params[4], which was 5.3 in some cases. Maybe increasing it to 6.3 isn't allowed, but 6.0 is the max. So perhaps trying 6.0 for params[4]. Also, looking at params[2], which was -5 in the top ones. Maybe trying -4 or -6. But the user said to explore both positive and negative values. 

Wait, the user's instruction says to use a search step size of 1.0 during exploration. So for each parameter, I can adjust it by +/-1.0 from the current value. But which parameters to adjust? The ones that are in the current top parameters but have some variation. For example, in the first example, params[4] is 5.3. If I increase that to 6.3, but that's over 6.0, so maybe 6.0. Alternatively, decrease it to 4.3. But in the examples, when params[4] was 4.3, the reward was lower. 

Alternatively, looking at params[6], which is -6 in the top examples. Maybe trying -5.0 instead. But that might be a step towards exploitation. Wait, but the user said if you are below 500, explore. Since the current examples have some at 500, but maybe the user's current state is at a lower value. Wait, the user hasn't provided the current f(params) value for iteration 251. Wait, the user's last message says "Now you are at iteration 251 out of 400. Provide the results..." but they didn't give the current reward. Hmm, maybe the previous examples are all the ones that have been tried so far. 

Looking at the examples, the highest rewards are 500.00. The user says the global optimum should be around 500. So maybe the current parameters are near that, but need to tweak. However, the user wants to avoid local optima. So perhaps trying to change some parameters that are in the top but have not been varied much. For example, in the top examples, params[8] and [9] are 5. Maybe increasing them to 6.0, but in some examples they are already 6.0. 

Alternatively, looking at params[1], which was 2.3 in the top examples. Maybe trying 3.3 or 1.3. But in the examples, when it was 3.3, the reward was lower. So perhaps trying other parameters. 

Another approach: since the policy is linear, maybe the optimal parameters are such that the weights for cart position and pole angle are high. For example, in the top examples, W for cart position is [[6, 2.3], ...], which might be trying to push the cart in the direction that stabilizes the pole. 

But I need to generate a new set of parameters that hasn't been tried before. Let me check the previous examples. For example, in the first example, params[0] is 6, [1] 2.3, [2] -5, [3] 6, [4] 5.3, [5] 6, [6] -6, [7] 6, [8] 5, [9] 5. 

If I change params[7] from 6 to 5, that's a possible exploration step. Also, maybe change params[2] from -5 to -4. Let's try that. So params[2] becomes -4, and params[7] becomes 5. Also, maybe adjust the bias terms. Let's see:

params[0]: 6
params[1]: 2.3
params[2]: -4
params[3]: 6
params[4]: 5.3
params[5]: 6
params[6]: -6
params[7]: 5
params[8]: 6
params[9]: 6

This is a new combination not seen before. It changes params[2] from -5 to -4, params[7] from 6 to 5, and increases the bias terms to 6. This might explore a new area. Alternatively, maybe increase params[4] to 6.0 instead of 5.3. Let me try that:

params[0]: 6
params[1]: 2.3
params[2]: -5
params[3]: 6
params[4]: 6.0
params[5]: 6
params[6]: -6
params[7]: 6
params[8]: 5
params[9]: 5

But in the previous examples, when params[4] was 6, the reward was 446.65. That's lower than 500. So maybe that's not good. So perhaps changing params[4] to 5.3 is better. 

Another parameter to change: params[6] is -6 in the top examples. Maybe trying -5. Let's try that:

params[0]: 6
params[1]: 2.3
params[2]: -5
params[3]: 6
params[4]: 5.3
params[5]: 6
params[6]: -5
params[7]: 6
params[8]: 5
params[9]: 5

But this was tried before and got 498.55. So not as good as 500. So maybe that's not helpful. 

Alternatively, changing params[8] and [9] from 5 to 6. Let's try that:

params[0]: 6
params[1]: 2.3
params[2]: -5
params[3]: 6
params[4]: 5.3
params[5]: 6
params[6]: -6
params[7]: 6
params[8]: 6
params[9]: 6

This was tried in one of the examples (params[8] and [9] as 6) and got 497.35. So lower than 500. Hmm. 

So maybe the best approach is to make small changes to the parameters that achieved 500, but in a way that hasn't been tried yet. For example, changing params[1] from 2.3 to 3.3 (but that was tried and got lower reward). Alternatively, changing params[2] to -5.5? Wait, parameters are in increments of 1.0, but the user said the parameters are in the range [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place. So possible values are like -6.0, -5.9, ..., 6.0. But the user's examples have parameters with one decimal place, like 2.3, 5.3, etc. 

Wait, the user said that the params values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place. So possible values are numbers like -6.0, -5.9, ..., 6.0. So when exploring with a step size of 1.0, that would mean changing a parameter by 1.0, but since it's in decimal steps, maybe changing from 2.3 to 3.3 (adding 1.0) or 1.3 (subtracting 1.0). 

In the previous examples, when params[1] was 2.3, changing it to 3.3 gave a lower reward. So maybe trying other parameters. For example, changing params[3] from 6 to 5.0. Let's try that:

params[0]: 6
params[1]: 2.3
params[2]: -5
params[3]: 5.0
params[4]: 5.3
params[5]: 6
params[6]: -6
params[7]: 6
params[8]: 5
params[9]: 5

This is a new combination. Maybe this will lead to a better reward. Alternatively, changing params[7] from 6 to 5.0. 

Another idea: check which parameters in the top examples have the most variation. For example, in the first example, params[4] is 5.3. Maybe trying 5.3 + 1.0 = 6.3, but that's over 6.0. So 6.0. But when that was tried, the reward was lower. 

Alternatively, check if there's a parameter that hasn't been varied much. For example, in the top examples, params[8] and [9] are 5 or 6. Maybe trying to set them to 4.0. But that might not be helpful. 

Alternatively, looking at params[6], which is -6.0 in the top examples. Maybe changing it to -5.0. But that was tried and resulted in lower reward. 

Hmm, this is tricky. The user wants exploration, but how to choose which parameters to change. Since the user said to use a step size of 1.0 during exploration, perhaps pick a parameter that's currently in the top and adjust it by +/-1.0. For example, take the first example where params[0] is 6, params[1] is 2.3. Let's adjust params[1] by +1.0 to 3.3 (already tried and got lower reward), or -1.0 to 1.3. Let's try that:

params[0]: 6
params[1]: 1.3
params[2]: -5
params[3]: 6
params[4]: 5.3
params[5]: 6
params[6]: -6
params[7]: 6
params[8]: 5
params[9]: 5

This is a new combination. Maybe this could lead to a better reward. 

Alternatively, adjust params[2] from -5 to -6.0:

params[0]: 6
params[1]: 2.3
params[2]: -6.0
params[3]: 6
params[4]: 5.3
params[5]: 6
params[6]: -6
params[7]: 6
params[8]: 5
params[9]: 5

This is a new combination. 

I think I need to pick one of these possibilities. Let's go with changing params[2] from -5 to -6.0 and params[1] from 2.3 to 1.3. Wait, but that's two changes. Alternatively, pick one parameter. 

Let me pick changing params[2] from -5 to -6.0. That's a step of -1.0. So:

params[0]: 6
params[1]: 2.3
params[2]: -6.0
params[3]: 6
params[4]: 5.3
params[5]: 6
params[6]: -6
params[7]: 6
params[8]: 5
params[9]: 5

This is a new combination. This might explore a different area. Alternatively, changing params[6] from -6 to -5.0. But that's already tried. 

Alternatively, changing params[7] from 6 to 5.0. Let's try that:

params[0]: 6
params[1]: 2.3
params[2]: -5
params[3]: 6
params[4]: 5.3
params[5]: 6
params[6]: -6
params[7]: 5.0
params[8]: 5
params[9]: 5

This is a new combination. 

I think this is a valid exploration step. Let's go with this.
