SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 191 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, I need to help find the global optimal policy for the cartpole environment using a linear policy and gradient ascent. The user provided some parameters and their corresponding episodic rewards. My goal is to use these examples to maximize the function f(params).

First, I'll look at the given data. There are several top-performing params with their respective rewards. For example, one has a reward of 437.80, another 420.05, and so on. These values are quite high, which suggests that these parameters are effective in balancing the cart's position, pushing it beyond the boundary, or keeping the pole upright.

The user is proposing that I provide params values again, but this time, they want to include all ten parameters in a specific format: 'params[0]: , params[1]: , ..., params[9]'. Each parameter should be within [-6.0, 6.0], with one decimal place each.

Looking at the top-performing params, I see that most of them have negative values for W (the weight matrix). For instance, some have -4.5 or -3.5 as their first two elements. However, a few have higher values like -2.4 and 6.0 in parameters [6] and [7], respectively.

I should consider whether increasing certain parameters might lead to better rewards. Since the reward increases when the pole is upright (params[6]) and the cart stays within bounds (params[8] and params[9]), maybe there's a way to push the cart further right or left without letting it go out of bounds, thus keeping the pole balanced.

I should also think about the structure of W. Each parameter in W controls how strongly each state element influences the action. Since actions are 0 or 1 (pushing left or right), higher positive values might make it easier to push the cart either direction without letting it fall off the track, which would cause the pole to balance better.

I need to decide whether to increase some parameters in W that correspond to the state elements that affect the pole's stability. For instance, if params[6] (pole angle) is too negative, making it more positive could help maintain the pole upright. Similarly, params[7] (angular velocity) being 4 or -2 might need adjustment—maybe increasing it can help counteract the pole's tilt.

On the other hand, pushing the cart further beyond certain points without letting it fall off the track is crucial. The reward doesn't penalize for the cart going out of bounds but does penalize for being too close to the boundaries, so I want to push as far as possible in either direction without losing too much reward from the pole's balance.

I should also think about the B vector [params[8], params[9]]. If both are positive and large, it might encourage moving in a certain direction. However, if they're too large, pushing the cart beyond safe limits could reduce the reward. Alternatively, perhaps adjusting these parameters to push more without causing immediate loss of rewards from balance.

Considering all this, I think focusing on increasing params[6] (pole angle) and maybe params[7] (angular velocity) could help maintain the pole upright by providing a stable reference. Also, making params[8] and [9] more positive could push the cart further to the right or left without immediately affecting the reward negatively.

I should propose parameters that balance these elements but also ensure they don't cause immediate negative effects on the reward. It's about finding a sweet spot where each parameter contributes positively to the episode length without compromising the pole's balance.
