SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

Now you are at iteration 126 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has given me a bunch of training examples for the cartpole environment with a linear policy. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward, which should ideally reach around 500. The current iteration is 126 out of 400, so there's still a lot of steps left.

Looking at the provided params, most of them have high values for params[0], [1], [3], [4], [5], [7], [8], [9], while some are negative like [2], [6]. The rewards are mostly around 497, but not quite hitting 500. The user mentioned that if the reward is below 500, it's a local optimum and we need to explore more.

The instruction says during exploration, use a search step size of 1.0. So maybe I should adjust some parameters by +/-1.0 from the current ones. Let's check the existing params. For example, in the first example, params[0] is 6, which is already at the upper bound. Maybe trying to lower some of the high values or increasing the negative ones could help. Alternatively, maybe some parameters that are currently at 6 can be adjusted down, and those at -6 can be adjusted up.

Wait, the user also said not to propose previously seen params. So I need to make sure that the new params aren't in the examples given. Looking at the examples, many have params[0] as 6, params[1] as 1.3, params[2] as -6 or -5, etc. So perhaps changing some of these to different values. For instance, maybe increasing params[2] from -6 to -5 (but that's already in some examples), or maybe changing params[1] from 1.3 to 0.3 or 2.3. Alternatively, adjusting params[4] or [5] which are around 5.3 or 5.7.

Another thought: the policy is a linear function, so the weights and biases determine the action. Maybe the current params are too skewed towards high values, leading to instability. Perhaps adjusting some of the weights to be more balanced. For example, if the cart position (params[0] and [2]) are too high, maybe reducing them could help the policy respond more effectively to the cart's position.

Also, the bias terms (params[8] and [9]) are all 6 in some examples. Maybe lowering them could help. But since the user wants exploration, perhaps trying to vary these parameters more. For example, setting params[8] to 5 instead of 6, or even lower.

Another angle: looking at the parameters that are frequently at the extremes (like 6 or -6). Maybe some of these are overfitting. For example, if params[0] is 6, maybe reducing it to 5.0 and increasing another parameter. But since the step size is 1.0, I need to make changes in steps of 1.0.

Wait, the user said during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So perhaps I should take one of the existing params and change one of the parameters by +/-1.0. For example, take the first example where params[0] is 6, params[2] is -6. Maybe change params[2] to -5 (but that's already in some examples). Alternatively, change params[0] from 6 to 5, and params[2] from -6 to -5. But that might be similar to existing examples.

Alternatively, maybe change params[1] from 1.3 to 2.3 or 0.3. Let's see. If I take the first example, which has params[1] as 1.3, and adjust that to 2.3, that could be a new param. Similarly, changing params[3] from 6 to 5.0. But need to ensure that the new params haven't been tried before.

Looking at the examples, most have params[1] as 1.3. So changing that to 0.3 or 2.3 might be unexplored. Let's try that. For example, let's take a param that's similar to the first example but adjust params[1] to 2.3. Also, maybe adjust some other parameters. But need to make sure that the new params are not in the existing list.

Another approach: since the global optimum is around 500, and the current examples are around 497, maybe we need to find a better combination. Perhaps increasing some parameters that are lower. For example, in some examples, params[4] is 5.3, maybe increasing that to 6.3 (but the max is 6.0). So that's not possible. Alternatively, decreasing some parameters that are high.

Alternatively, looking at the parameters that are not at the extremes. For example, params[4] is 5.3 in some cases. Maybe increasing that to 6.0. But again, need to check if that's already in the examples.

Alternatively, maybe adjusting the bias terms. For example, in the first example, params[8] and [9] are both 6. Maybe lowering them to 5.0. That could be a new param.

Putting it all together, perhaps a new param set could be: params[0] 5.0 (instead of 6), params[1] 2.3 (instead of 1.3), params[2] -5.0 (instead of -6), params[3] 5.0 (instead of 6), params[4] 6.0, params[5] 6.0, params[6] -5.0, params[7] 5.0, params[8] 5.0, params[9] 5.0. This changes several parameters from the existing examples, possibly leading to a better reward.

But I need to ensure that this param set hasn't been used before. Looking at the examples, there's one with params[0] 5, params[1] 1.3, etc. But changing params[1] to 2.3 and others would be new. This might be a valid exploration step.
