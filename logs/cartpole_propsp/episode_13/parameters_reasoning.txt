SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to optimize the parameters for a linear policy in the CartPole environment. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward, which they mentioned should be around 500. The current examples show that the best so far is 228.80, which is way below 500. So, the user is probably in a local optimum and needs to explore more.

Looking at the provided examples, the top params have some patterns. For instance, params[0] is around 4, params[1] is -1.7, and some others have negative values. But since the global optimum is supposed to be higher, maybe there's a better combination of parameters that's not been tried yet.

The user mentioned that during exploration, a step size of 1.0 should be used. So, I need to perturb the current parameters by adding or subtracting 1.0 to each parameter to explore new areas. But I have to make sure not to repeat any previous params.

Looking at the current top params, like the one with params[0]:4, params[1]:-1.7, etc., maybe increasing some of the parameters that are currently lower could help. For example, params[7] is 3.2 in one case and 2.2 in another. Maybe increasing that to 4.2 or 5.2 could be worth trying. Also, some parameters like params[6] are at -4.9 or -5.9. Maybe adjusting those to more positive values might help.

Wait, but the user said to use a step size of 1.0 during exploration. So, if I take the current best params (like the one with 228.80) and add or subtract 1.0 to each parameter, that would be the way to go. Let's take that params set:

params[0]:4, params[1]:-1.7, params[2]:-4, params[3]:3.1, params[4]:0.3, params[5]:-2.2, params[6]:-4.9, params[7]:3.2, params[8]:1.3, params[9]:1.8.

Now, applying a step of +1.0 to some parameters and -1.0 to others. For example, increasing params[0] to 5, or decreasing to 3. Similarly for other parameters. But I need to ensure that the new params are within the [-6.0, 6.0] range and have one decimal place.

Let me think about which parameters might be critical. The W matrix has four rows, each with two weights. The B has two biases. Maybe adjusting the biases (params 8 and 9) could influence the action selection. For instance, increasing params[8] from 1.3 to 2.3 or 0.3. Similarly for params[9].

Another approach is to look for parameters that are near the edges of the range. For example, params[6] is at -4.9, which is close to -6.0. Maybe increasing that to -3.9 could help. Also, params[3] is at 3.1; increasing to 4.1 or 2.1.

But since the user wants exploration, I should generate several new params by adding and subtracting 1.0 to each parameter in the current best. Let's try modifying a few parameters:

Take the best params (params[0]:4, params[1]:-1.7, etc.), and for each parameter, create two variations: one increased by 1.0 and one decreased by 1.0. However, since there are 10 parameters, this would generate 20 variations. But the user wants to avoid repeating previous params. Looking at the examples, some of these variations might already exist, like params[7] at 2.2 or 3.2. So, need to check which ones are new.

Alternatively, pick a few parameters to change. For example, change params[6] from -4.9 to -3.9 (adding 1.0), and params[7] from 3.2 to 4.2. Also, adjust params[8] and [9] to see if increasing them helps. Maybe:

params[0]:5 (increase by 1), params[1]:-0.7 (increase by 1), params[2]:-3 (increase by 1), params[3]:4.1 (increase by 1), params[4]:1.3 (increase by 1), params[5]:-1.2 (increase by 1), params[6]:-3.9 (increase by 1), params[7]:4.2 (increase by 1), params[8]:2.3 (increase by 1), params[9]:2.8 (increase by 1). This is a variation where each parameter is increased by 1.0 from the original best. But need to check if this set is already in the examples. Looking at the examples, there's a similar set with params[0]:1, params[1]:-0.7, etc., but not exactly this. So this could be a new set.

Alternatively, another variation could be decreasing some parameters. For example, params[0]:3 (decrease by 1), params[1]:-2.7 (decrease by 1), etc. But need to ensure that these are not in the examples.

The key is to generate new parameters that haven't been tried before. Since the current best is 228.80, which is still low, exploration is needed. Let me create a new set by adjusting a few parameters with step size 1.0. For instance, take the current best and add 1.0 to params[0], params[3], params[7], and params[8], while subtracting 1.0 from params[1], params[2], params[5], params[6], and params[9]. But need to check the ranges.

Wait, params[1] is -1.7. Subtracting 1.0 would make it -2.7, which is allowed. params[2] is -4, subtract 1.0 to -5. params[5] is -2.2, subtract 1.0 to -3.2. params[6] is -4.9, subtract 1.0 to -5.9. params[9] is 1.8, subtract 1.0 to 0.8. params[0] is 4, add 1.0 to 5. params[3] is 3.1, add 1.0 to 4.1. params[7] is 3.2, add 1.0 to 4.2. params[8] is 1.3, add 1.0 to 2.3. That gives a new set:

params[0]:5, params[1]:-2.7, params[2]:-5, params[3]:4.1, params[4]:0.3, params[5]:-3.2, params[6]:-5.9, params[7]:4.2, params[8]:2.3, params[9]:0.8. 

Looking at the examples, there's one with params[0]:5, params[1]:-2.7, params[2]:-3, etc., but this one has params[2] as -5, which might be new. So this could be a valid candidate for exploration. This set hasn't been seen before in the examples provided. So this could be a good candidate to try next.
