SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let me think about how to approach this. The user has given me a bunch of training examples where the params are varied slightly, and in most cases, the reward is 500.00. However, there's one example where changing params[0] from 3.2 to 4.2 resulted in a lower reward (484.95), and another where changing params[9] to 5.2 gave 454.15. But other variations, like adjusting params[8] or params[7], still hit 500.00. 

The goal is to find the global optimum, which the user mentioned should be around 500. But since some of the examples already reach 500, maybe we need to explore more. The user also said that if we're below 500, we should explore instead of exploiting. Wait, but some examples are already at 500. However, the user's note says the global optimum should be around 500, but maybe there's a higher value possible? Or perhaps the examples provided are in a local optimum.

Looking at the examples, many of them have params[0] as 3.2, params[1] as 4.3, params[2] as 1.3, params[3] as 4.6, params[4] as -2.4, params[5] as 1.9, params[6] as -4.9, params[7] as -0.1, params[8] as 3.3, and params[9] as 4.2. All these variations give 500.00. But when they changed params[0] to 4.2, the reward dropped. Similarly, changing params[9] to 5.2 also dropped the reward. However, changing params[8] to 4.3 and params[9] to 5.2 gave 500 again. 

So maybe the current set of parameters is in a flat region where small changes don't affect the reward. To escape this, the user suggests exploration with a step size of 1.0. Since the current parameters are around 3.2 for params[0], maybe trying a larger step, like increasing params[0] by 1.0 to 4.2 (but that example already gave a lower reward). Alternatively, maybe trying negative steps. Wait, but the user says to search both positive and negative values. So perhaps trying to adjust other parameters. 

Looking at params[8] and params[9], which are the bias terms. In some examples, params[8] was 3.3, and in another, it was 4.3. Changing that didn't affect the reward. Similarly, params[9] was 4.2 in most examples, but changing it to 5.2 or 3.2 didn't change the reward. So maybe the bias terms are not the key here. 

Looking at the weight matrix W. For example, params[6] is -4.9. If we change that to -5.9, the reward was still 500.00. Similarly, changing params[7] from -0.1 to 0.9 or -1.1 also gave 500. So perhaps the weight parameters are in a region where small changes don't affect the reward. 

To explore, maybe we should take a larger step. For example, increasing params[0] by 1.0 (from 3.2 to 4.2) but that example gave 484.95, which is worse. Alternatively, decreasing params[0] by 1.0 to 2.2, but that example gave 223.25, which is worse. So maybe that's not the direction. 

What about other parameters? Let's look at params[4], which is -2.4. If we increase that by 1.0 to -1.4, would that help? Or decrease it to -3.4? In the examples, changing params[4] to -3.4 gave 500.00. So that's still in the same range. 

Another approach: look for parameters that haven't been varied much. For example, params[2] is 1.3 in most examples. What if we change that to 2.3 or 0.3? The examples show that changing params[2] to 2.3 or 0.3 still gave 500.00. So maybe that's not the key. 

Looking at params[5], which is 1.9. Changing it to 2.9 (as in one example) gave 500.00. So again, no change. 

Hmm. Maybe the current set of parameters is already in a region where the reward is maximized, and further exploration isn't helping. But the user says the global optimum is around 500, so perhaps 500 is the maximum possible. However, the user's note says that if you're below 500, you should explore. But here, the current examples are at 500, so maybe we need to check if there's a way to get higher than 500. 

Wait, but the examples given all have f(params) of 500.00. So maybe the maximum is indeed 500. However, the user says the global optimum should be around 500, implying that perhaps there's a way to get slightly higher. But given that all the examples are at 500, maybe that's the maximum. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is mistaken, but the instructions say to aim for the global optimum. Since the user says that the global optimum should be around 500, and all the examples are hitting 500, perhaps we're already at the maximum. However, the user's note says that if you are below 500, explore. But in this case, we are at 500. So maybe the answer is to stick with the current parameters. But the user also says to not propose previously seen params. 

Looking at the examples, the first one has params[0] to [9] as 3.2, 4.3, 1.3, 4.6, -2.4, 1.9, -4.9, -0.1, 3.3, 4.2. Then in the next example, params[8] is 4.3 and params[9] is 4.2. So maybe varying other parameters. For example, changing params[8] to 4.3 (as in one example) and params[9] to 5.2 (but that gave lower reward). 

Alternatively, trying to change multiple parameters at once. For example, increasing params[0] by 1.0 (to 4.2) and adjusting other parameters to compensate. But since that example gave lower reward, maybe that's not the way. 

Alternatively, trying to change params[6] from -4.9 to -3.9 (as in one example) and that still gave 500.00. So maybe the current parameters are in a flat region. 

Since the user says to explore with a step size of 1.0 during exploration, perhaps I should take a step in a different parameter. For example, let's look at params[7], which is -0.1. Changing that to -1.1 (as in one example) gave 500.00. So that's still in the same range. 

Another parameter to consider is params[8], which is 3.3 in most examples. What if we change that to 4.3? In one example, that was done and the reward was 500.00. So no change. 

Hmm. Maybe the best approach is to take a step in a parameter that hasn't been varied much. For example, params[3] is 4.6 in most examples. What if we increase it by 1.0 to 5.6? In one example, that was done, and the reward was 500.00. So that's still the same. 

Alternatively, decreasing params[3] to 3.6, which was done in an example and gave 500.00. 

So all these variations are still giving 500.00. Therefore, perhaps the maximum is indeed 500.00, and the user's note about the global optimum being around 500 is correct. Therefore, the current parameters are already optimal. 

But the user's instruction says to not propose previously seen params. So I need to find a new set of parameters that hasn't been tried yet. For example, changing params[6] from -4.9 to -5.9 (as in one example) gave 500.00. But maybe changing it further to -6.9? Wait, but the parameter range is [-6.0, 6.0], so -6.0 is the minimum. So changing params[6] to -6.0. 

Let me check if that's allowed. The parameters must be in [-6.0, 6.0] with one decimal place. So yes, -6.0 is allowed. So perhaps changing params[6] to -6.0. 

Another parameter to consider is params[4], which is -2.4. Changing that to -3.4 (as in an example) gave 500.00. What about changing it to -4.4? But that's beyond the range of -6.0, but -4.4 is within the range. Wait, the state is cart position, velocity, etc., but the parameters are in [-6.0, 6.0]. So changing params[4] to -3.4 is allowed, and that was done in an example. 

Alternatively, trying to change params[5] from 1.9 to 2.9 (as in an example) gave 500.00. What about changing it to 3.9? That's within the range. 

But since the user says to explore with a step size of 1.0 during exploration, perhaps taking a step of 1.0 in one of the parameters. For example, if params[0] is 3.2, adding 1.0 gives 4.2, but that example gave lower reward. Alternatively, subtracting 1.0 gives 2.2, which also gave lower reward. So maybe that's not the right direction. 

What about params[2] (1.3)? Adding 1.0 gives 2.3, which was tried and gave 500.00. Subtracting 1.0 gives 0.3, which was also tried and gave 500.00. So that's still in the same range. 

Another parameter: params[7] is -0.1. Adding 1.0 gives 0.9, which was tried and gave 500.00. Subtracting 1.0 gives -1.1, which was tried and gave 500.00. 

Hmm. All these steps are giving the same reward. So maybe the maximum is indeed 500.00, and there's no higher reward possible. Therefore, the current parameters are already optimal, but since the user says not to propose previously seen params, I need to find a new set. 

Perhaps changing multiple parameters. For example, increasing params[0] by 1.0 (to 4.2), but that example gave lower reward. However, maybe adjusting other parameters to compensate. For instance, if params[0] is increased to 4.2, but also adjust params[1] or other parameters. However, without knowing the exact relationship, this is speculative. 

Alternatively, trying to change a parameter that hasn't been varied much. For example, params[8] is 3.3. What if we change it to 4.3 (as in an example) and params[9] to 5.2 (which gave lower reward). But that's not helpful. 

Alternatively, changing params[8] to 2.3 and params[9] to 3.2. But that's just a guess. 

Alternatively, looking at the parameters that are in the middle of the range. For example, params[0] is 3.2, which is near the upper half of the range [-6.0, 6.0]. Maybe trying to lower it to 2.2, but that example gave lower reward. 

Another approach: check which parameters are most likely to affect the reward. The policy is a linear function, so the weights and biases determine the action. The state variables are cart position, velocity, pole angle, and angular velocity. The weights for each state variable determine how each contributes to the action choice. 

For example, if the cart position is important, then the first row of W (params[0] and params[1]) might be significant. Similarly, the pole angle (third row) is important for balancing. 

In the examples, the weights for cart position (params[0] and params[1]) are 3.2 and 4.3. Maybe increasing these further could help. But when params[0] was increased to 4.2, the reward dropped. So perhaps there's an optimal range. 

Alternatively, looking at the bias terms. The bias terms (params[8] and params[9]) are 3.3 and 4.2. Maybe adjusting them to different values. For example, changing params[8] to 4.3 and params[9] to 5.2, but that example gave lower reward. 

This is quite challenging. Since all variations seem to hit 500.00, maybe the maximum is indeed 500.00, and the current parameters are already optimal. However, the user says to explore if below 500, but since we're at 500, perhaps the answer is to propose a new set of parameters that haven't been tried yet, even if they might not improve the reward. 

For example, changing params[6] from -4.9 to -6.0 (the minimum allowed). Let's try that. So params[6] = -6.0. Other parameters remain as in the first example. That would be a new set of parameters not seen before. 

Alternatively, changing params[7] from -0.1 to 0.9 (already tried), but maybe changing it further. However, the maximum is 6.0, so 0.9 is within range. 

Alternatively, changing params[5] from 1.9 to 2.9 (already tried), but maybe to 3.9. 

Since the user says to not propose previously seen params, I need to find a new combination. Let's try changing params[6] to -6.0 and params[7] to 0.9. That's a new set. 

So the new params would be:

params[0]: 3.2; params[1]: 4.3; params[2]: 1.3; params[3]: 4.6; params[4]: -2.4; params[5]: 1.9; params[6]: -6.0; params[7]: 0.9; params[8]: 3.3; params[9]: 4.2;

This hasn't been tried before in the examples provided. Let's go with this.
