SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 64 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the next set of parameters for the cartpole environment. The user provided some examples and their corresponding rewards. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward f(params), aiming for around 500.

Looking at the examples, the highest reward so far is 428.05. But the user mentioned that the global optimum should be around 500, so there's room for improvement. The current examples have some parameters set to 6, others to lower values. Maybe I should explore different combinations, especially since the user said to use a search step size of 1.0 during exploration.

First, I should check which parameters are being used in the current top examples. The top ones have params[0], [1], [3], [4], [5], [7], [8], [9] set to higher values like 6, while some are negative, like params[2], [6]. Maybe there's a pattern here. For example, in the first example, params[0] is 6, params[1] is 1.3, params[2] is -3, etc. The reward is 428.05, but maybe adjusting some of these parameters could lead to a higher reward.

Since the user mentioned to explore both positive and negative values with a step size of 1.0, I should consider varying the parameters that are currently at the extremes. For example, in the current examples, params[0] is 6, which is the maximum allowed. Maybe reducing that by 1.0 to 5.0 could help. Similarly, params[2] is -3, so maybe increasing it to -2.0 or even -1.0?

Alternatively, looking at the parameters that are lower in the examples, like params[4] is 5.3 in some cases. Maybe increasing that to 6.0 could help. But I need to ensure that I'm not just tweaking the same parameters but also exploring new combinations.

Another thing to note is that the bias terms (params[8] and [9]) are often set to 6.0 in the top examples. Maybe adjusting those could also influence the reward. However, since the current examples have them at high values, perhaps lowering them slightly might help in some cases.

Wait, the user said not to propose previously seen params. So I need to make sure that the new parameters aren't exactly the same as the ones listed. For example, the first example has params[0] as 6, params[1] as 1.3, etc. So I should avoid those exact values but maybe vary them by 1.0 in either direction where possible.

Let me think of a strategy. Since the current examples have some parameters at 6.0, maybe trying to lower them and see if that helps. For instance, take params[0] from 6.0 to 5.0, and adjust other parameters accordingly. Also, check if the parameters that are lower (like params[2] at -3) could be increased to -2.0 or even 0.0.

Another approach is to look for parameters that haven't been explored much. For example, in the given examples, params[2] is mostly around -3, but maybe trying -4 or -2. Similarly, params[6] is often -6, but maybe trying -5 or -7 (but wait, the range is [-6.0, 6.0], so -6 is the minimum). So maybe -6 is already the lower bound, so can't go lower. So perhaps increasing params[6] to -5.0.

Also, looking at the parameters that are in the middle range, like params[1] is 1.3 in some cases. Maybe trying 0.3 or 2.3 to see if that affects the reward.

Wait, the user mentioned that during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So if a parameter is at 1.3, adding or subtracting 1.0 would take it to 0.3 or 2.3. Similarly for others.

So, considering that, let's pick a parameter that's been used in the examples and adjust it. For example, in the first example, params[2] is -3.0. Let's try increasing it by 1.0 to -2.0. Also, params[6] is -6.0, which is the minimum. Maybe increasing that to -5.0. Then, check other parameters.

Another parameter that's been used is params[4] at 5.3. Maybe increasing that to 6.0. Similarly, params[5] is 2.7. Maybe increasing to 3.7 or 1.7.

But I need to ensure that I'm not just making random changes. Maybe focus on the parameters that are in the W matrix. For example, the W matrix has four rows, each with two parameters. The bias B has two parameters. So, perhaps adjusting the W parameters to influence the action selection more effectively.

Alternatively, considering that the policy is a linear function, the parameters in W and B determine the decision boundary. So, perhaps adjusting the parameters that are in the W matrix to better capture the state's features.

But without knowing the exact dynamics, it's hard to say. So, perhaps a better approach is to take the current best parameters (the first example with 428.05) and perturb them by 1.0 in some parameters. For example, in that example, params[0] is 6.0. Let's lower that to 5.0. Also, params[1] is 1.3, so maybe lower to 0.3 or increase to 2.3. Similarly, params[2] is -3.0, so increase to -2.0. params[3] is 6.0, maybe lower to 5.0. params[4] is 5.3, increase to 6.0. params[5] is 2.7, increase to 3.7. params[6] is -6.0, increase to -5.0. params[7] is 6.0, lower to 5.0. params[8] and [9] are 6.0, maybe lower to 5.0.

But this is just one possibility. Alternatively, maybe changing params[0] to 6.0 (already max), so no change. Maybe changing params[1] from 1.3 to 0.3. But that's a step of -1.0. However, the user said to explore both positive and negative, so that's allowed.

Another thought: the current examples have a lot of parameters at 6.0, but maybe that's not optimal. Perhaps reducing some of those to see if the reward increases. For example, if params[0] is 6.0, maybe reducing to 5.0 and adjusting other parameters accordingly.

But I need to make sure that I'm not repeating the same parameters as before. Let's check the previous examples. For instance, the first example has params[0] as 6, params[1] as 1.3, params[2] as -3, etc. So if I adjust params[0] to 5, params[1] to 0.3, params[2] to -2, params[3] to 5, params[4] to 6, params[5] to 3.7, params[6] to -5, params[7] to 5, params[8] to 5, params[9] to 5. That would be a new set of parameters not seen before.

Alternatively, maybe increasing some parameters that are lower. For example, in some examples, params[4] is 5.3, which is close to 6.0. Maybe setting that to 6.0.

Another approach is to look at the parameters that have been changed in the examples. For example, in some cases, params[5] is 2.7 or 3.7. Maybe trying 4.7 or 1.7. But again, need to ensure that the new parameters haven't been used before.

Considering all this, perhaps the best approach is to take the first example (which has the highest reward) and perturb a few parameters by ±1.0. For example, changing params[0] from 6.0 to 5.0, params[2] from -3.0 to -2.0, params[6] from -6.0 to -5.0, and params[7] from 6.0 to 5.0. Then, keep the rest as in the first example. That would give a new set of parameters that haven't been seen before and explore different regions of the parameter space.

So, the new params would be:

params[0]: 5.0
params[1]: 1.3
params[2]: -2.0
params[3]: 6.0
params[4]: 5.3
params[5]: 2.7
params[6]: -5.0
params[7]: 5.0
params[8]: 6.0
params[9]: 6.0

This set hasn't been seen in the previous examples, and it's a variation of the first example with some parameters adjusted. This should help in exploring the parameter space further, possibly leading to higher rewards.
