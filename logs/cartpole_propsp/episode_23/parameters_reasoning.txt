SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is working on optimizing a linear policy for the CartPole environment. They've provided a bunch of training examples with different parameter values and corresponding episodic rewards. The goal is to find the global optimum, which they mention should be around 500. But looking at the examples, the highest reward so far is 224.50. That's still way below 500, so there's definitely more exploration needed.

First, I need to understand the pattern in the successful examples. Looking at the parameters that gave higher rewards, like the one with f(params)=224.50: params[0] is -3.8, params[1] is 2.5, params[2] and [3] are 5.6, params[4] is -5.6, params[5] is 3.6, params[6] is -5.3, params[7] is 6, and the bias terms are around 2.7 and 2.9. It seems like some of the weights are set to higher values, especially the positive ones, while others are negative. Maybe there's a balance between positive and negative weights that helps in stabilizing the pole.

The user mentioned that during exploration, a step size of 1.0 should be used. So, from the current iteration, I should consider perturbing the parameters by ±1.0 in some of the dimensions. However, the parameters are constrained between -6.0 and 6.0, so I need to make sure that any changes stay within that range.

Looking at the previous examples, some parameters that were effective had high positive values in certain weights and high negative in others. For instance, params[2], [3], [7] were 5.6 or 6.0, while params[4] and [6] were negative. Maybe increasing some of the positive weights further or adjusting the negative ones could lead to higher rewards.

But since the user emphasized exploring rather than exploiting, even if a certain parameter set gives a decent reward, it's better to explore new areas. So, I should look for parameters that haven't been tried yet, particularly in regions where previous attempts didn't reach. For example, in the earlier examples, some parameters were set to -5.8, but maybe pushing them further to -6.0 could help, or adjusting other parameters that were previously lower.

Another thing to note is that the reward increases when the parameters are tuned in a way that the policy can balance the pole longer. The linear policy's weights determine how the state variables influence the action. For example, if the cart's position (params[0] and [1]) are weighted in a way that moves the cart towards the center when it's off-balance, that would help. Similarly, the pole's angle and angular velocity (params[2]-[7]) need to be adjusted to correct the tilt.

But since the user wants exploration, maybe trying a new combination where some parameters are set to extremes. For example, setting params[0] to -6.0, params[1] to 6.0, and see how that affects the reward. However, I have to ensure that this hasn't been tried before. Looking at the provided examples, there's a params[0] of -5.8, but not -6.0 yet. Similarly, some other parameters might be at the edge of the range.

Alternatively, looking at the successful example with 224.50, maybe increasing params[3] from 5.6 to 6.0, or adjusting params[7] from 6 to 6.0. Also, checking if the bias terms (params[8] and [9]) can be adjusted. In that example, they were 2.7 and 2.9. Maybe increasing them further could help.

But again, the key is exploration. So, instead of tweaking the existing high-performing parameters slightly, perhaps trying a completely new set. For instance, setting params[0] to -6.0, params[1] to 6.0, params[2] to 6.0, params[3] to 6.0, params[4] to -6.0, params[5] to 6.0, params[6] to -6.0, params[7] to 6.0, and then the bias terms to 6.0 and 6.0. But that's a very aggressive move and might not be effective. However, since the user wants exploration, maybe trying that.

Wait, but the previous example with params[0] as -4.8 and others had a reward of 224.50. Maybe adjusting some of the parameters that were previously lower. For example, in that example, params[0] was -3.8, but if we increase it to -4.8 (which is within the range), maybe that helps. Or adjusting params[4] from -5.6 to -6.0.

But I need to make sure that the new parameters haven't been tried before. Looking through the examples, some parameters have been tested at -6.0, but not all. For example, in one of the examples, params[1] was -7.6, but that's outside the allowed range. Wait, no, the user said the params are in [-6.0, 6.0], so that example must be invalid. Wait, looking back at the user's provided examples, there's one with params[1]: -7.6, which is outside the allowed range. That's a mistake, but maybe it's a typo. But the user's instruction says that params are in [-6.0, 6.0], so that example might be incorrect. However, the user is providing these examples, so I have to work with them as given.

But back to the task. The user wants me to generate a new set of parameters that haven't been tried before. So, looking at the previous examples, I need to avoid repeating any of the existing ones. For example, in the 224.50 case, the parameters were:

params[0]: -3.8; params[1]: 2.5; params[2]: 5.6; params[3]: 5.6; params[4]: -5.6; params[5]: 3.6; params[6]: -5.3; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 2.7; params[9]: 2.9.

So, to explore new areas, maybe changing some of the parameters that were set to 5.6 or 6.0 to higher or lower values, but within the range. For example, increasing params[2] from 5.6 to 6.0, or decreasing params[4] from -5.6 to -6.0. Also, adjusting the bias terms from 2.7 and 2.9 to other values.

Another approach is to look for parameters that haven't been explored much. For instance, in the examples, some parameters like params[8] and [9] (the bias) have varied between -3.8 and 5.1, but maybe trying higher values like 6.0. Similarly, some weights might be set to lower values, so increasing them.

But since the user wants exploration with a step size of 1.0, perhaps taking a step in a direction that hasn't been explored yet. For example, in the successful example, params[0] was -3.8. If we take a step of 1.0 in the negative direction, that would be -4.8 (which was used in another example). But maybe taking a step in the positive direction, from -3.8 to -2.8 (which was also used in another example). Alternatively, trying a completely new parameter set where some parameters are at the extremes.

Alternatively, considering that the global optimum is around 500, which is much higher than the current examples, there's a need to find a better configuration. Maybe the current high-performing parameters are not optimal, and further exploration is needed. For example, adjusting the weights for the pole's angular velocity (params[6] and [7]) to be more responsive.

But without knowing the exact function f(params), it's challenging. However, based on the examples, higher rewards seem to come from certain combinations of high positive and negative weights. So, perhaps trying a new combination where some parameters are set to extremes, like:

params[0]: -6.0; params[1]: 6.0; params[2]: 6.0; params[3]: 6.0; params[4]: -6.0; params[5]: 6.0; params[6]: -6.0; params[7]: 6.0; params[8]: 6.0; params[9]: 6.0.

But this is just a guess. However, since the user wants exploration, this might be a valid move. But I need to ensure that this hasn't been tried before. Looking at the examples, there's a params[0] of -5.8, but not -6.0. Similarly, other parameters haven't been set to 6.0 in some cases. So, this could be a new exploration step.

Alternatively, maybe adjusting some of the parameters that were previously lower. For example, in the example with 224.50, params[6] was -5.3. If we increase that to -6.0, maybe that helps. Or adjust params[7] from 6 to 6.0 (already at the maximum). So, that's already the max. So, maybe adjusting other parameters.

But given the time constraints and the need to explore, the best approach is to take a step in a new direction. So, perhaps adjusting some parameters that were previously set to lower values. For example, in the successful example, params[0] was -3.8. If we take a step of 1.0 to the left (more negative), that would be -4.8, which was used in another example. But if we take a step to the right (less negative), that would be -2.8, which was also used. So, maybe trying a different parameter, like params[1] increasing from 2.5 to 3.5, which was used in another example. Hmm.

Alternatively, trying to adjust params[4] from -5.6 to -6.0, which is within the range. That could be a new parameter set. Let's try that. So, taking the previous successful example and changing params[4] from -5.6 to -6.0, and maybe adjusting other parameters slightly. For example:

params[0]: -3.8; params[1]: 2.5; params[2]: 5.6; params[3]: 5.6; params[4]: -6.0; params[5]: 3.6; params[6]: -5.3; params[7]: 6.0; params[8]: 2.7; params[9]: 2.9.

This changes params[4] to -6.0, which might be a new exploration step. Alternatively, adjusting other parameters. But I need to make sure that this hasn't been tried before. Looking at the previous examples, there's one with params[4] as -6.0, but in another context. For example, the example with params[0]: -4.8; params[1]: 0.5; params[2]: 2.6; params[3]: 2.6; params[4]: -2.6; params[5]: 1.6; params[6]: -2.3; params[7]: 3.6; params[8]: -1.3; params[9]: -1.1; f(params): 127.00. That's different.

So, the new parameter set with params[4] as -6.0 hasn't been tried before. Therefore, this could be a valid exploration step. Alternatively, adjusting multiple parameters. But since the user wants exploration with a step size of 1.0, changing one parameter by 1.0 is sufficient.

Another possibility is to take a step in the bias terms. For example, increasing params[8] from 2.7 to 3.7. That would be a step of 1.0. But again, need to check if that's been tried before. Looking at the examples, there's a params[8]: 3.7 in one example. So, that might have been tried.

Alternatively, adjusting params[5] from 3.6 to 4.6. That's a step of 1.0. Let's see if that's been tried. In one of the examples, params[5] was 4.6. So, that might be a valid step.

But given the time, maybe the best approach is to take a step in one of the parameters that was previously set to a lower value and increase it. For example, in the successful example, params[5] was 3.6. Increasing that to 4.6. Let's try that. So, the new parameters would be:

params[0]: -3.8; params[1]: 2.5; params[2]: 5.6; params[3]: 5.6; params[4]: -5.6; params[5]: 4.6; params[6]: -5.3; params[7]: 6.0; params[8]: 2.7; params[9]: 2.9.

This changes params[5] from 3.6 to 4.6. This is a new parameter set that hasn't been tried before. Alternatively, adjusting params[6] from -5.3 to -6.3, but that's outside the allowed range. So, can't do that. So, -6.0 is the max negative.

Alternatively, adjusting params[7] from 6.0 to 6.0 (already at max). So, that's not possible. So, maybe adjusting other parameters.

Another thought: looking at the example with the highest reward so far (224.50), the params[2], [3], [7] are all at 5.6 or 6.0. Maybe increasing params[2] to 6.0. So, changing params[2] from 5.6 to 6.0. That would be a new parameter set. Let's try that:

params[0]: -3.8; params[1]: 2.5; params[2]: 6.0; params[3]: 5.6; params[4]: -5.6; params[5]: 3.6; params[6]: -5.3; params[7]: 6.0; params[8]: 2.7; params[9]: 2.9.

This changes params[2] to 6.0, which might be a new exploration step. But need to check if that's been tried before. Looking at the examples, there's one with params[2] as 6.0, but in a different context. For example, the example with params[0]: -4.8; params[1]: 3.5; params[2]: 6; params[3]: 6; params[4]: -6; params[5]: 4.6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 3.7; params[9]: 3.9; f(params): 177.45. So, that's a different set. Therefore, the new parameters with params[2] as 6.0 haven't been tried in that exact combination.

So, this could be a valid exploration step. Alternatively, trying to adjust other parameters. But given the time and the need to explore, this seems like a reasonable move.
