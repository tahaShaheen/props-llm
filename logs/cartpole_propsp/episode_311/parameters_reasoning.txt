SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 311 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to help improve the cartpole environment's reward by adjusting the policy parameters. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward f(params). 

First, looking at the provided top performing parameters and their rewards: params[0] = 6, others vary but result in a reward of 500.00. Then, some more varied params also give around 500. Now, during iteration 311, the current params are [-6; -4.5; 3; 6; -6; 1.8; -3.5; 4.5; -2.5; -2.5] and the reward is 490.90, which is slightly lower than the top rewards.

I need to find parameters that push f(params) above 500. Let me think about how each parameter affects the state.

The cart's velocity (params[1]) being high could help balance the pole. A low pole angle (params[2]) would also help. The cart's position and angular velocity might not be as critical since the goal is within bounds.

I should increase params[0] to 6, which is already doing that. Maybe reduce params[1], but let's see. Alternatively, perhaps making some parameters more negative could decrease their impact? Let me check each parameter:

params[0]: 6 → high cart position, helps if pole upright.
params[1]: -4.5 vs current 6. Lower velocity might help in balancing the pole.
params[2]: 3 is actually a problem because it's above the lower bound of -0.418. The lower the angle, the better. Maybe set params[2] to -0.418 or even below?
Wait, if I reduce params[2], that would make the pole more upright. But since it's already 3, which is a lot higher than the max of -0.418, maybe setting it to a lower value could be beneficial. Alternatively, perhaps increasing params[2] could help in making the pole more upright.

Wait, the reward is +1 only when pole is upright (angle close to 0) and cart within bounds. So if params[2] is too low, maybe it doesn't contribute much until pole angle becomes zero. But with current params[2], pole angle is -6, which is bad. So increasing params[2] might bring the pole angle closer to zero.

Similarly, params[4] is cart velocity (-6), but if I increase that, perhaps the pole can be balanced better without the cart moving too fast.

What about params[3]: 6. Since it's a angular velocity parameter for pole, maybe making it too high could cause more disturbance. Maybe increasing it beyond 6 would not help unless it stabilizes.

I think trying to set params[2] and params[4] higher might be beneficial. Let me try some values:

params[0]: 6 (high cart position)
params[1]: perhaps 7? Lower velocity than current.
Wait, but the environment has params with limited decimal places: [-6.0; -4.5; ...]. So I can't change to 7.

Alternatively, maybe setting params[2] to a lower value like -3 or -3.5 could help pole upright faster without making it too low immediately.

Let me try:

params[0]: 6
params[1]: 6 (current) → Lower velocity might balance better.
params[2]: 3 (current, which is bad)
Wait, maybe set params[2] to -0.418, the lower bound, but that's already given as a possible parameter?

Alternatively, perhaps increase params[2] from 3 to -6? Wait, no, because the max for pole angle is -0.418, so it can't go beyond that.

Wait, maybe set params[2] = -0.418 (the lower bound). Let me see how that affects the reward.

If I set params[2] to a more negative value (lower), then the pole would need less time to reach 0 angle, which is good. But if it's too low, maybe for some reason the reward isn't as much? Or perhaps the cart can move more freely with lower angles?

I'm not sure. Let me try an example:

params[0] =6; params[1]=6; params[2]=-3.5 → which is the best performing case (f=500). 

Now, if I set params[4] to a higher value than -6, like -5, perhaps that helps balance the pole better without moving too fast.

Let me try:

params = [6, 6, -3.5, 6, -5, ...].

Wait, but what about params[2] which is currently 3 in top cases? Maybe increasing it to a lower value like -0.418 would help the pole angle reach zero faster.

But I'm not sure how much effect that has on velocity (params[1]). It might make the pole tilt too quickly, but if it's more upright sooner, maybe it helps with balance.

Alternatively, perhaps trying to set params[4] higher than -6 to increase cart velocity. Let me see:

If I set params[4]=-5 instead of -6 in one of the top cases, would that help?

Hmm, not sure. Maybe try some random values around 6 for each parameter and test.

I think a systematic approach is better: iterate through possible combinations of parameters in certain ranges to find which combination gives the highest reward.

But since I can't run code right now, perhaps I can reason about which parameters are more influential.

 params[0]: high cart position (good) → 6
params[1]: low velocity (good if pole upright) → 6
params[2]: high pole angle (bad) → 3
params[3]: high angular velocity of pole (bad)
params[4]: high cart velocity (good)
params[5]: -6 (poles are already falling, bad)
params[6]: -3.5 (pole is upright in top cases)
params[7]: high (angular velocity of pole; bad)
params[8]: low (-2.5) → bad
params[9]: same as 8.

So the main issues are params[4], params[2], and params[6]. Maybe increasing these could help.

Let me try:

params = [6, -4.5 (from top), -3.5, 6, ...]

Wait, but I can't change params[1] in that case because it's already at the top value. So perhaps setting params[2] to -0.418 and params[4] to a higher velocity.

Let me try:

params = [6; 6; -3.5; 6; -6; -6; ...]

Wait, that might be worse because pole angle is -6 and cart velocity is -6, both bad.

Alternatively, perhaps making some of them more negative but others less?

I'm not sure. Maybe trying to set params[2] to a lower value than current (from top) could help the pole reach upright faster without too much disturbance.

Let me try:

params = [6; 6; -3.5; 6; -6; ...]

Wait, that's still bad for pole angle and cart velocity. Maybe reducing params[2] and increasing some others?

Alternatively, perhaps setting params[4] higher than current (from top) to help balance the pole without too much speed.

I think after trying several combinations, maybe something like [6; 6; -3.5; 6; -6; ...], but I'm not sure if that works. Maybe I should try more systematic testing by varying each parameter in small increments and see which combination gives a higher reward.

But since the system has multiple parameters, it's challenging without actual code to test all combinations. However, based on the top cases where params[2]=-3.5 gave 500, perhaps adjusting that might help.

So maybe set params[2] = -4 instead of -3.5 and see if that improves the reward.
