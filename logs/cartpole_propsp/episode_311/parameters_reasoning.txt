SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 311 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has provided a bunch of training examples for the cartpole environment with different parameter values and their corresponding episodic rewards. The goal is to find the global optimal policy, which they mention should be around 500. The current iteration is 311 out of 400, so there are still 89 steps left. 

Looking at the examples, several of them have a reward of 500.00. The top ones are very similar, with params[0] at 6, params[1] at 2.3, params[2] at -5, params[3] at 6, params[4] at 5.3, params[5] at 6, params[6] at -6, params[7] at 6, params[8] and [9] at 5. However, there are some variations in params[4] and [3], like in one example params[3] is 5 instead of 6, and params[4] is 5.2 or 5.3. But those have slightly lower rewards, like 499.95 or 499.35. 

The user mentioned that if we're below 500, we should explore instead of exploit. Since the current examples are already hitting 500, but maybe there's a way to tweak some parameters to get even higher. However, the user also said that the global optimum is around 500, so maybe those examples are already near optimal. But the instruction says to explore if we're below 500. Wait, but the examples here are already at 500.00. However, the user might be suggesting that there's a better solution, but the examples given are already at 500.00. 

Wait, but the user's note says that the global optimum should be around 500. So if the examples are already at 500, maybe that's the maximum. But the user's instruction says that if you're below that, you should explore. However, the current examples are at 500.00, which is the target. But maybe there are variations that could lead to slightly higher rewards. However, since the examples are already at 500, perhaps the best is to stay there. But the user might be expecting to explore further, but the note says that if you're below 500, you should explore. Since the current examples are at 500, maybe we should not explore but stick with the existing parameters. 

But the user also said that during exploration, use a search step size of 1.0. But since the current parameters are already at the maximum, maybe we need to check if there are any other parameters that could be adjusted. However, looking at the examples, the parameters that are varying are in the W matrix and B. For example, in some cases, params[3] is 5 or 6, but when it's 6, the reward is 500.00. Similarly, params[4] is 5.3 or 5.2. But when it's 5.3, the reward is higher. 

Wait, but in the first example, params[4] is 5.3 and the reward is 500.00, and in another example, params[4] is 5.2 and the reward is 499.95. So that suggests that changing params[4] from 5.3 to 5.2 reduces the reward. So maybe the optimal value for params[4] is around 5.3. Similarly, in another example, params[3] is 5 instead of 6, and the reward is lower. So maybe keeping params[3] at 6 is better. 

But the user's instruction says to not propose previously seen params. So the existing examples have already tried some combinations. So perhaps we need to explore other parameters. For example, looking at params[2], which is -5 in most examples. What if we change that to -4 or -6? But in the examples, when params[2] was -4, the reward was 499.95, which is slightly lower. Similarly, changing params[2] to -6 might not be better. 

Another parameter is params[1], which is 2.3 in most examples. In one example, it's 3.3, leading to a lower reward. Another example has params[1] as 1.3, which also led to a lower reward. So 2.3 seems to be a good value for params[1]. 

Looking at the B parameters, params[8] and [9] are both 5 in the examples. In one case, params[8] was 6 and the reward dropped to 334.95, which is a big drop. So keeping params[8] and [9] at 5 is better. 

So the current best parameters are the ones that have 500.00 reward. However, the user wants to avoid proposing previously seen params. The first example given has params[0] to [9] as 6, 2.3, -5, 6, 5.3, 6, -6, 6, 5, 5. So if I need to propose a new set, I need to vary some parameters but not the ones that are already in the top examples. 

But how to choose which parameters to vary? The instruction says to explore with a step size of 1.0. So perhaps perturbing one parameter by +/-1.0. For example, looking at params[6], which is -6 in the examples. If I change that to -5 or -7 (but -7 is outside the range of [-6.0, 6.0], so -5.0. Let's try that. 

Alternatively, looking at params[7], which is 6. Changing that to 5 or 7 (but 7 is outside the range). So 5.0. 

Another parameter is params[4], which is 5.3. If we change that to 6.3 (but that's beyond 6.0), so 6.0. Or 4.3. But in one example, when it was 4.3, the reward was 499.35. So maybe 5.3 is better. 

Alternatively, looking at params[2], which is -5. If we change that to -6 or -4. But when it's -4, the reward was 499.95, which is slightly lower. 

So maybe the best approach is to explore by changing one parameter that's in the current top parameters but not in the ones that have been tried. For example, looking at params[0], which is 6.0. What if we change that to 5.0? But that's a step of -1.0. 

Alternatively, looking at params[5], which is 6.0. Changing that to 5.0. 

But the user wants to avoid previously seen parameters. Since the first example has params[0] as 6, params[1] as 2.3, etc., changing any of those parameters would be a new set. However, we need to ensure that we don't repeat the exact same parameters. 

So, let's pick a parameter that hasn't been varied much. For example, in the examples, params[6] is -6.0. What if we increase that by 1.0 to -5.0? Let's try that. 

So, changing params[6] from -6 to -5.0. Let's see. The original parameters were:

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5.

Changing params[6] to -5.0. So the new params would be:

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -5; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5.

But wait, in one of the examples, params[6] was -5 and the reward was 498.55, which is lower than 500. So that might not be good. So maybe that's not a good direction. 

Alternatively, what about changing params[7] from 6 to 5.0? Let's try that. 

params[7] is 6.0. Changing to 5.0. So new params:

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 5; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5.

But in one example, when params[7] was 5, the reward was lower. However, maybe there's a better combination. 

Alternatively, let's look at params[8] and [9], which are 5.0. In one example, params[8] was 6.0 and that led to lower reward. What if we change params[8] to 6.0 and see? But that's already tried. 

Alternatively, what about changing params[1] from 2.3 to 3.3 or 1.3? But those were tried and gave lower rewards. 

Another idea: maybe changing params[4] from 5.3 to 6.0. Let's try that. 

So, params[4] is 5.3. Changing to 6.0. 

New params:

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 6.0; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5.

This is a new set. Since in the examples, params[4] was 5.3, 5.2, 4.3, etc., but not 6.0. So this might be a new exploration. 

Alternatively, changing params[3] from 6 to 5.0. But that was tried and gave lower reward. 

Another parameter to consider is params[2], which is -5.0. What if we change it to -6.0? Let's try that. 

params[2]: -6.0. So new params:

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -6; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8맊

Okay, I think I need to pick one parameter to change. Since the user wants to avoid previously seen parameters, and the examples have tried several variations, but not all. Let's go with changing params[4] from 5.3 to 6.0. That's a step of +0.7, but the instruction says to use a step size of 1.0. Wait, the instruction says during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So changing a parameter by +/-1.0. 

params[4] is 5.3. Changing by +1.0 would make it 6.3, which is beyond the allowed range (max is 6.0). So that's not allowed. Changing by -1.0 would make it 4.3. Which was tried and gave lower reward. 

Hmm. So maybe that's not a good direction. 

What about params[5], which is 6.0. Changing that by -1.0 to 5.0. Let's try that. 

New params:

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 5; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5.

This is a new set. Since in the examples, params[5] was 6.0, but not 5.0. 

Alternatively, changing params[0] from 6.0 to 5.0. 

New params:

params[0]: 5; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5.

This is also a new set. 

But which one is more likely to give a better result? It's hard to say, but since the user wants to explore, we need to pick one. 

Alternatively, looking at params[7], which is 6.0. Changing to 5.0. 

New params:

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 5; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5.

This is another new set. 

Since the user wants to explore, and the instruction says to use a step size of 1.0, I'll go with changing params[7] from 6.0 to 5.0. 

So the final parameters would be:

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 5; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5.
</think>

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 5; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5
