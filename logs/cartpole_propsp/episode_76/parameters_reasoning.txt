SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 76 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to find the global optimal policy for the cartpole environment. The user mentioned that the current best score is around 500, and the goal is to reach higher than that. But since we're at iteration 76 of a maximum of 400 steps, maybe there's still room to improve.

First, I need to understand the parameters involved in the policy. The linear policy uses W with 18 parameters and B as [params[8], params[9]]. So each parameter affects how the state is transformed into an action.

I should start by thinking about how these parameters influence the pole balance and cart position. A higher score means a better balance of pole upright, cart within bounds, etc. So increasing some parameters could help push the system closer to this optimal point.

Looking at the best results provided earlier, when params[0] is 6.6 and others are varied, the scores range from 99.55 to 157.70. This suggests that certain combinations can yield decent results but not necessarily the global optimum yet.

Since we're at iteration 76, maybe there's a slight improvement we can make in the next few steps without hitting the maximum number of steps. I should consider increasing some parameters slightly and then see how it performs right away.

For instance, looking at params[0], which is the first parameter in W, if I increase it a bit while keeping others moderate, perhaps the system's balance improves. Similarly, adjusting other parameters to have more leverage on different aspects like pole angle control could help.

I should also be cautious not to make any moves that could take us out of bounds or cause the cart to move too far. So, balancing increases in certain parameters with corresponding decreases in others might keep everything within acceptable ranges.

Maybe starting with a small increase in params[0] andparams[2], since they control pole angle, and see how the score changes right away. If that's not enough, I can gradually introduce more significant adjustments in subsequent iterations.

I also need to ensure that each step uses a different set of parameters so that we don't converge too quickly without exploring other possibilities. That way, each improvement is genuine progress towards the global optimum rather than just refining a local area.

Additionally, it's important to monitor both the score and the number of steps taken. While the user mentioned not to provide any additional text, keeping track of how our score increases with each iteration will help us see if we're heading in the right direction.

In summary, my plan is to adjust the parameters incrementally, focusing on areas that can improve the pole balance and cart stability without causing overshoot or extreme movement. By making these small adjustments at each step, I should be able to approach the global optimal score more effectively than before.
