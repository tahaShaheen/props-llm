SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

Now you are at iteration 258 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user provided some training examples and the current iteration is 258 out of 400. The goal is to find the optimal parameters for the CartPole environment. The previous examples show that some parameters are giving around 500 reward, which is the global optimum mentioned. But the user says if we're below that, we should explore instead of exploit.

Looking at the top examples, the first few have params like [6, 2.3, -5, 6, 5.3, 6, -6, 6, 5, 5] with f(params) 500.00. Then there's another one with params[2] as -4 and others slightly different, but the reward is lower. The most recent examples have lower rewards, like 348.80 and 397.05, which are much lower. 

The user's instruction says that during exploration, we should use a search step size of 1.0. So maybe we need to perturb the parameters that are part of the high-reward examples. Let's take the first example with 500 reward and try to tweak some parameters by +/-1.0. For example, params[2] is -5 in the first example. If we change that to -6 or -4, but in the examples, changing params[2] to -4 gave a lower reward. Maybe other parameters? Let's look at params[6], which is -6. If we change that to -5 or -7 (but the range is up to -6.0, so maybe -5). 

Alternatively, check the B terms (params[8] and params[9]). In the first example, they are 5 and 5. Maybe increasing them to 6 or decreasing to 4. But in another example, params[8] and [9] are 6 and 6, but that gave a lower reward. Hmm.

Wait, the user says not to propose previously seen params. So we need to generate new ones. Let's take the first example with 500 reward. Let's pick a parameter that's at the edge of the range and perturb it. For example, params[0] is 6.0. If we decrease it by 1.0 to 5.0. Similarly, params[3] is 6.0. Maybe decrease that to 5.0. Also, params[7] is 6.0. Let's try changing that to 5.0. 

Alternatively, maybe increase some parameters. For example, params[1] is 2.3. Adding 1.0 would make it 3.3. But since the range is up to 6.0, that's allowed. However, we need to ensure that we don't repeat previous params. Let's check the previous examples. The first example has params[0] as 6, params[1] as 2.3. If we change params[1] to 3.3, that's new. Similarly, maybe adjust params[4] which is 5.3. Adding 1.0 would be 6.3, but that's over the limit. So maybe 6.0. 

Another approach: look at the parameters that have been changed in the lower reward examples. For instance, in one example, params[8] was changed from 5 to 6, which led to lower reward. So maybe reducing params[8] back to 5. But that's already in the high-reward example. 

Alternatively, check other parameters. Let's look at params[2] which is -5. If we change that to -6 (since the range is [-6.0, 6.0]), but in one example, changing params[2] to -6 gave lower reward. However, maybe other parameters can be adjusted. For example, params[6] is -6. If we change that to -5. 

So, let's try modifying a few parameters from the high-reward example. Let's take the first high-reward example: [6, 2.3, -5, 6, 5.3, 6, -6, 6, 5, 5]. Let's change params[2] from -5 to -6 (since that's allowed), and params[6] from -6 to -5. That would give a new set of parameters. Also, maybe adjust params[8] from 5 to 6. Let's see:

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 2.3, params[2]: -6, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 5.3, params[5]: 6, params[6]: -5, params[7]: 6, params[8]: 6, params[9]: 5. 

Wait, but in the examples, when params[2] was -6, the reward was lower. But maybe changing params[6] to -5 and params[8] to 6 could lead to a better result. Alternatively, maybe adjust params[7] from 6 to 5. 

Alternatively, let's try changing params[4] from 5.3 to 6.0. That might be a possible step. Let's see:

params[0]: 6, params[1]: 2.3, params[2]: -5, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 6.0, params[5]: 6, params[6]: -6, params[7]: 6, params[8]: 5, params[9]: 5. 

But in the examples, when params[4] was 5.3, the reward was 500. If we increase it to 6.0, maybe that's a new parameter set. 

Alternatively, since the user says to explore with step size 1.0, maybe perturb one parameter at a time. Let's pick a parameter that's in the middle of the range and change it by +/-1.0. For example, params[1] is 2.3. Changing it to 3.3 or 1.3. Let's try 3.3. 

So, params[0]: 6, params[1]: 3.3, params[2]: -5, params[3]: 6, params[4]: 5.3, params[5]: 6, params[6]: -6, params[7]: 6, params[8]: 5, params[9]: 5. 

This is a new parameter set that hasn't been tried before. Let's go with that.
