SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what the next step should be. The user provided a bunch of previous params and their corresponding rewards. The goal is to find the global optimum, which is supposed to be around 500. Right now, the highest reward from the examples is 413.65, which is still below 500, so we need to explore more.

Looking at the examples, many of the params have values around 6 or -6, especially in W and B. The highest rewards are from params where some elements are 6, like params[0], [3], [7], and [8], [9]. But maybe there's a better combination that hasn't been tried yet.

The user mentioned that during exploration, we should use a search step size of 1.0. So, perhaps we can take some of the existing high-performing params and adjust them by +/-1.0 in some parameters to explore new areas. For example, in the first example, params[0] is 6. Maybe increasing it to 7 isn't allowed since the range is [-6.0, 6.0]. Wait, no, the params are within that range. So, maybe adjusting other parameters. Let's see.

Looking at the first example: params[0] is 6, params[1] is 1.3, params[2] is -3, params[3] is 6, params[4] is 5.3, params[5] is 2.7, params[6] is -6, params[7] is 6, params[8] is 5, params[9] is 5. The reward is 413.65. Maybe adjusting params[1] from 1.3 to 2.3 (adding 1.0) could help. Also, params[4] is 5.3, which is close to 6. Maybe increasing that to 6.3 isn't allowed. So perhaps trying to adjust other parameters.

Another approach is to look for parameters that are at the extremes (like 6 or -6) and see if changing them slightly might lead to higher rewards. For instance, in the first example, params[6] is -6. If we change that to -5, maybe that could help. But since the user said to use a step size of 1.0 during exploration, we need to make changes in steps of 1.0. However, the current params are already at the extremes. So maybe trying to adjust other parameters that are not at the extremes.

Wait, but the params are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with one decimal place. So, for example, if a parameter is 5.3, adding 1.0 would take it to 6.3, which is outside the allowed range. So that's not possible. Therefore, perhaps looking for parameters that are in the middle and adjusting them.

Alternatively, maybe the current examples are all in a local optimum, and we need to explore different regions. For example, some parameters might be negative when they should be positive, or vice versa. Let's check the examples. In the first example, params[2] is -3. Maybe changing that to -4 or -2. But in the second example, params[2] is -4 and the reward is lower. So maybe -3 is better. But I'm not sure.

Another thing to consider is the structure of the policy. The action is the argmax of the state multiplied by W plus B. So, the weights W and the bias B determine the linear combination. To maximize the reward, the policy needs to correctly balance the cart. This likely involves adjusting the weights so that the policy responds appropriately to the cart's position, velocity, pole angle, and angular velocity.

Looking at the W matrix, each row corresponds to a state variable. For example, the first row (params[0] and [1]) corresponds to cart position. The second row (params[2] and [3]) is cart velocity, etc. The B is the bias for each action. So, the policy is choosing between two actions based on the linear combination of the state and the weights, plus the bias.

Perhaps the current examples have high values in some of the W parameters but not all. Maybe adjusting the parameters that are not at the extremes. For example, in the first example, params[4] is 5.3, which is close to 6. Maybe increasing that to 6 would help. But in the fourth example, params[4] is 6, and the reward is 379.45, which is lower than the first example. So that's not helpful. Hmm.

Alternatively, looking at the bias terms (params[8] and [9]). In the first example, they are 5 and 5. In other examples, they are sometimes 6. Maybe increasing them further? But they can't go beyond 6.0. So perhaps not.

Another angle: the user mentioned that the global optimum should be around 500. The current highest is 413. So, there's a lot of room for improvement. Maybe the current exploration is not sufficient. Since the user said to explore both positive and negative values, maybe trying some parameters that are negative where they are currently positive, or vice versa.

For example, in the first example, params[2] is -3. If we change that to -2 (adding 1.0), but that might not be the right direction. Alternatively, changing some other parameters. Let's think about the policy. The action is determined by the linear combination. For the policy to balance the cart, when the cart is to the left (negative position), the policy should push right (action 1). So, the weights for cart position (params[0] and [1]) should be such that when the cart is left, the value for action 1 is higher. Similarly for other variables.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe the best approach is to take one of the existing high-performing params and perturb some of the parameters by +/-1.0 to explore new regions. For example, take the first example (params[0] to [9] as given) and change params[1] from 1.3 to 2.3 (adding 1.0), or params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3 (but that's over the limit). So instead, maybe change params[4] to 6.0 (since 5.3 + 0.7 = 6.0). But the step size is 1.0. So, perhaps changing params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3 is not allowed, so maybe that's not possible. Alternatively, changing params[4] from 5.3 to 4.3 (subtracting 1.0). But that might not be helpful.

Alternatively, looking at params[6] which is -6 in the first example. If we change that to -5 (adding 1.0), maybe that's a step in the right direction. Let's try that. So, changing params[6] from -6 to -5. That's a step of +1.0. Let's see what that would do. The first example's params would then be: params[6] is -5. Maybe that could help. But how to know? Since we can't simulate, we have to make an educated guess.

Another approach: look for parameters that are not at the extremes and adjust them. For example, in the first example, params[1] is 1.3. Maybe changing that to 0.3 (subtracting 1.0) or 2.3 (adding 1.0). If we try adding 1.0 to params[1], making it 2.3, which is in the allowed range. Then, the new params would be params[0]:6, params[1]:2.3, etc. But looking at the examples, there's already an entry where params[1] is 2.3 (the fifth example) with a lower reward. So maybe that's not the direction.

Alternatively, looking at params[5] in the first example, which is 2.7. Adding 1.0 would make it 3.7, but I don't know if that helps. However, the user said to explore, so maybe trying that.

But without knowing which parameters are more influential, it's tricky. Maybe the best approach is to take the first example (which has the highest reward so far) and perturb one parameter by +/-1.0. For example, changing params[2] from -3 to -4 (subtracting 1.0). But in the second example, params[2] is -4 and the reward is lower. So maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, changing params[2] from -3 to -2 (adding 1.0). That would be a new parameter not seen before.

So, let's try changing params[2] from -3 to -2. That's a step of +1.0. Then, the new params would be:

params[0]:6; params[1]:1.3; params[2]:-2; params[3]:6; params[4]:5.3; params[5]:2.7; params[6]:-6; params[7]:6; params[8]:5; params[9]:5.

This hasn't been tried before, so it's a new exploration. Maybe this could lead to a higher reward. Alternatively, changing another parameter. But since we need to generate one set of params, this could be a candidate.

Alternatively, changing params[8] and [9] from 5 to 6. But in some examples, they are 6. Let's see, in the first example, they are 5. Maybe increasing them to 6. So, changing params[8] and [9] to 6. That would be a step of +1.0. Let's try that. Then, the params would be:

params[0]:6; params[1]:1.3; params[2]:-3; params[3]:6; params[4]:5.3; params[5]:2.7; params[6]:-6; params[7]:6; params[8]:6; params[9]:6.

This might be a new set of parameters. Since the previous examples have some with higher values in B, but maybe increasing them further could help.

But I'm not sure. However, the user said to explore, so trying these changes is necessary. Let's go with changing params[8] and [9] to 6. That's a possible step.
