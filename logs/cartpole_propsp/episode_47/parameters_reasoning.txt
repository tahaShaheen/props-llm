SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

Now you are at iteration 47 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is working on optimizing a linear policy for the CartPole environment. They've provided a bunch of training examples where the episodic reward is consistently 500.00, which is the maximum possible in this environment. The current iteration is 47 out of 400, and they need me to suggest new parameters that haven't been used before.

First, I need to recall that the global optimum is around 500, so if we're already hitting that, maybe we're in a local optimum. But the user mentioned that if we're below 500, we should explore. However, in the examples given, all the f(params) are 500.00, which suggests that the current parameters are already achieving the maximum reward. But the user's instruction says that if we're below 500, we should explore. However, in this case, we're at 500, so maybe we need to check if there's a way to improve further or confirm that we're at the global optimum.

Wait, but the user says the global optimum should be around 500. So if we're already hitting 500, maybe we're done. However, the user might be expecting that there's a way to get even higher, but according to the problem statement, the maximum possible reward is 500, so that's the upper bound. Therefore, any parameters that achieve 500 are already optimal.

But the user's instruction says that during exploration, we should use a search step size of 1.0. However, in the examples provided, the parameters that achieve 500 are already present. The challenge here is that the user wants to avoid proposing previously seen parameters. So, I need to find new parameters that haven't been tried yet, but that might be difficult if the current ones are already optimal.

Looking at the examples, most of the parameters have values like 3.2, 4.3, 1.3, etc. The B parameters (params[8] and [9]) are around 3.3 to 4.2. Maybe there's a way to tweak some of the other parameters. For instance, looking at params[0], which is 3.2 in most examples. What if we increase it by 1.0 to 4.2? But wait, in one of the examples, params[0] was 4.2, and the reward was 482.15, which is lower. That suggests that changing some parameters might decrease performance. However, maybe other parameters can be adjusted.

Alternatively, looking at params[4], which is -2.4 in many examples. If we adjust that, maybe to -3.4 or -1.4, but in the examples, those were tried and resulted in 500.00 as well. So perhaps that parameter is not critical. 

Another approach: since the current parameters are achieving 500, maybe we can try perturbing some parameters by 1.0 step to explore. For example, take one of the existing parameters and change one of them by +1.0 or -1.0. Let's pick a parameter that hasn't been changed much. For instance, params[6] is -4.9 in most examples. If we add 1.0, making it -3.9, but that was already tried (in one of the examples, params[6] was -3.9 and achieved 500.00). Similarly, if we go to -5.9 or -6.0, which were also tried. So maybe that's not helpful.

What about params[7]? In some examples, it's -0.1, but in others, it's -1.1 or 0.9. Those were tried and still achieved 500.00. So perhaps that parameter isn't critical either.

Looking at params[8] and [9], which are B. In some examples, they are 3.3 and 4.2, but in others, 4.3 and 3.2. Those variations didn't affect the reward. So maybe the B parameters are more flexible.

But the user wants to avoid previously seen parameters. So, I need to find a combination that hasn't been tried yet. Let's look for parameters that are different. For example, in the examples, params[2] is mostly 1.3, but in one case, it was 2.3 and 0.3. Those were tried and still achieved 500.00. So perhaps that's not the issue.

Another thought: maybe the user is expecting that even though the reward is 500, there's a better policy. But according to the problem statement, 500 is the maximum possible. So, if the current parameters achieve 500, they are already optimal. However, the user's instruction says that if you're below 500, explore. But in this case, we are at 500. Therefore, maybe the answer is that we can't improve further and the current parameters are optimal. However, the user might want to continue exploring to confirm that there's no better policy.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to adjust some parameters to reach a slightly higher reward, but given that 500 is the maximum, that's not possible. Therefore, the best approach is to stick with the parameters that achieve 500.00, but ensure that they haven't been used before. However, the user has already provided many examples where the same parameters are used. So, the challenge is to find new parameters that also achieve 500.00.

Wait, but the user's instruction says that the global optimum is around 500. So, if we are already at 500, we don't need to explore further. However, the user's instruction says that if you're below that, explore. Since we are at 500, maybe we can stop. But the problem is that the user might not know that and is expecting us to continue exploring. However, given the information, I think the best answer is to suggest parameters that have not been used before but are similar to the existing ones, ensuring that they are within the [-6.0, 6.0] range and with 1 decimal place.

For example, looking at params[0], which is 3.2 in most examples. What if we try 3.2 + 1.0 = 4.2, but that was tried and resulted in lower reward. So that's not good. Alternatively, maybe changing a different parameter. For instance, params[5] is 1.9 in most examples. If we change that to 2.9 or 0.9. But in one example, params[5] was 2.9 and achieved 500.00. So that's possible.

Alternatively, let's look for a parameter that hasn't been varied much. For example, params[1] is 4.3 in all examples. What if we change that to 5.3 or 3.3? Let's try changing params[1] to 5.3. But that might be outside the range of previous examples. However, the user says that the parameters can be in the range [-6.0, 6.0], so 5.3 is acceptable. Let's try that. But I need to ensure that this combination hasn't been used before. Since in the examples, params[1] was always 4.3, changing it to 5.3 would be new.

So, let's create a new set of parameters where params[1] is 5.3, keeping others the same. For example:

params[0]: 3.2; params[1]: 5.3; params[2]: 1.3; params[3]: 4.6; params[4]: -2.4; params[5]: 1.9; params[6]: -4.9; params[7]: -0.1; params[8]: 3.3; params[9]: 4.2.

This hasn't been tried before, and it's within the allowed range. This might be a candidate. However, I need to check if this is a valid move. Since the user says to explore with a step size of 1.0 during exploration, but in this case, we are changing params[1] from 4.3 to 5.3, which is a +1.0 step. That fits the exploration step size.

Alternatively, changing another parameter. For example, params[3] is 4.6. Changing that to 5.6 (a +1.0 step). Let's try that:

params[0]: 3.2; params[1]: 4.3; params[2]: 1.3; params[3]: 5.6; params[4]: -2.4; params[5]: 1.9; params[6]: -4.9; params[7]: -0.1; params[8]: 3.3; params[9]: 4.2.

This was already tried in one of the examples, where params[3] was 5.6 and achieved 500.00. So that's already covered. Therefore, that's not a new parameter set.

Another parameter to change: params[2] is 1.3. Changing it to 2.3 (a +1.0 step) was tried before and achieved 500.00. So that's not new.

What about params[7] changing from -0.1 to +0.9 (which was tried in an example). So that's already done.

Hmm. Maybe changing params[8] from 3.3 to 4.3 (a +1.0 step). In one of the examples, params[8] was 4.3 and achieved 500.00. So that's already tried.

Alternatively, changing params[9] from 4.2 to 5.2. That's a +1.0 step. Let's check if that's been tried. In the examples, params[9] was 4.2, 3.2, etc. So changing to 5.2 hasn't been tried. So that's a new parameter set.

So, the new parameters would be:

params[0]: 3.2; params[1]: 4.3; params[2]: 1.3; params[3]: 4.6; params[4]: -2.4; params[5]: 1.9; params[6]: -4.9; params[7]: -0.1; params[8]: 3.3; params[9]: 5.2.

This is a new parameter set, with params[9] increased by 1.0. Since the user wants exploration with step size 1.0, this fits. Even though the previous examples had params[9] as 4.2, 3.2, etc., this is a new value. So this could be a candidate.

Alternatively, changing another parameter. For example, params[4] is -2.4. Changing it to -3.4 (a -1.0 step). That was tried in an example and achieved 500.00. So that's already done.

Another idea: changing params[6] from -4.9 to -5.9 (a -1.0 step). That was tried and achieved 500.00. So that's already done.

Hmm. So the only new parameters I can think of are those that change params[1] to 5.3 or params[9] to 5.2. Let's go with changing params[9] to 5.2. That's a valid exploration step and hasn't been tried before. Let's propose that.
