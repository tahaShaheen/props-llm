SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.
params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5; f(params): 500.00
params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5; f(params): 500.00
params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -4; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5; f(params): 499.95
params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 4.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5; f(params): 499.35
params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -5; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5; f(params): 498.55
params[0]: 6; params[1]: 1.3; params[2]: -6; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 6; params[9]: 6; f(params): 497.35
params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 6; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5; f(params): 416.30
params[0]: 6; params[1]: 3.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5; f(params): 354.80


Now you are at iteration 271 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user provided some examples of params and their corresponding rewards. The goal is to find the optimal params that maximize the episodic reward. From the examples, the highest reward is 500.00, and there are a few params that reach that. Looking at those, the first two examples have params[0] at 6, params[1] at 2.3, params[2] at -5, params[3] at 6, and so on. The differences between the top ones are in params[4], params[5], params[6], etc. 

But the user mentioned that the global optimum should be around 500, and if we're below that, we should explore instead of exploit. Since the current iteration is 271 out of 400, there's still room for exploration. However, the examples given already have some params hitting 500.00. But maybe there's a way to tweak them further.

Looking at the first example that hits 500.00: params[0] is 6, params[1] 2.3, params[2] -5, params[3] 6, params[4] 5.3, params[5] 6, params[6] -6, params[7] 6, params[8] 5, params[9] 5. The next example is similar but with params[4] at 5.0 instead of 5.3, and it also gives 500.00. So maybe varying params[4] around 5.3 could be a way to explore.

The user's instruction says during exploration, use a search step size of 1.0. So, perhaps adjusting some parameters by ±1.0 from the current values. Let's check which parameters are in the examples. For instance, params[4] is 5.3 in one case, and 5.0 in another. If I increase params[4] to 6.3, or decrease to 4.3, but need to stay within the range of -6.0 to 6.0. Wait, 5.3 +1.0 is 6.3, which is over 6.0. So maybe 6.0 is the max. Similarly, decreasing 5.3 by 1.0 would be 4.3. 

Looking at the third example, which has params[4] at 5.3, but params[2] is -4 instead of -5. That gives a slightly lower reward. So maybe adjusting params[2] from -5 to -6 or -4? But the first example has params[2] at -5 and gets 500.00. 

Alternatively, looking at params[6] in the first example: it's -6. In another example, it's -5, which gives a lower reward. So maybe keeping params[6] at -6 is better. 

But since the user wants exploration, perhaps changing some parameters that are near the edge. For example, params[0] is already at 6.0, which is the maximum. Maybe changing params[1] from 2.3 to 3.3 or 1.3. Wait, in one example, params[1] is 1.3 and the reward is lower. But maybe trying 3.3? However, in the examples, when params[1] was 3.3, the reward was 354.80, which is much lower. So that's not good. So maybe not changing params[1] much. 

Looking at params[8] and params[9], they are both 5 in the top examples. Maybe changing them to 6 or 4. Let's see. If I increase params[8] to 6, but in one example, params[8] is 6 and params[9] is 6, but that gave a reward of 497.35. So that's lower. Maybe keeping them at 5 is better. 

Another parameter to check is params[7], which is 6 in the top examples. If I change that to 5 or 7 (but 7 is over the limit). So maybe 5. But that might lower the reward. 

Alternatively, looking at params[5], which is 6 in the top examples. If I decrease that to 5, but in one example, params[5] was 6, and that's part of the 500.00 reward. So maybe not changing that. 

Hmm, perhaps the best approach is to take one of the top examples and make a small change. For example, take the first example with 500.00 and adjust one parameter by ±1.0. Let's pick params[4], which is 5.3. If I increase it to 6.0 (since 5.3 + 0.7 is 6.0, but the step size is 1.0, so maybe 5.3 + 1.0 = 6.3, which is over the limit. So the maximum is 6.0. So changing params[4] from 5.3 to 6.0. Let's try that. 

So the new params would be: params[0]:6, params[1]:2.3, params[2]:-5, params[3]:6, params[4]:6.0, params[5]:6, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:5, params[9]:5. But wait, in the examples, when params[4] was 6.0, the reward was 416.30, which is much lower. So that's worse. So maybe that's not a good idea. 

Alternatively, decrease params[4] by 1.0 to 4.3. But in one example, that gave 499.35. So that's slightly lower than 500.00. Maybe not helpful. 

What about changing params[2] from -5 to -6? Let's see. In one example, params[2] was -6 and params[1] was 1.3, which gave lower reward. But if I take the first example and change params[2] from -5 to -6, keeping other parameters the same. Let's try that. 

So new params: params[0]:6, params[1]:2.3, params[2]:-6, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:6, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:5, params[9]:5. 

But I need to check if this has been tried before. Looking at the examples, there's one where params[2] is -6 and params[1] is 1.3, but that's a different set. So this might be a new combination. 

Alternatively, maybe changing params[6] from -6 to -5. But in the examples, when params[6] was -5, the reward was lower. 

Another parameter to consider is params[8] and params[9]. In the top examples, they are both 5. If I increase them to 6, but that example had lower reward. So maybe not. 

Alternatively, changing params[7] from 6 to 5. But that might lower the reward. 

Hmm, maybe the best approach is to take the first example with 500.00 and slightly vary one parameter. For instance, params[4] is 5.3. If I change it to 5.3 + 1.0 = 6.3, but that's over the limit. So 6.0. But that example had lower reward. So that's not good. 

Alternatively, check other parameters. For example, params[3] is 6.0. If I decrease it by 1.0 to 5.0. Let's see. So new params: params[3]:5.0. But I don't know what that would do. 

Alternatively, maybe changing params[8] from 5 to 6. Let's try that. So params[8]:6, keeping others same. 

But in one example, params[8] and params[9] were both 6, and the reward was 497.35. Which is lower than 500.00. So maybe that's worse. 

Wait, but the user says that during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So even if the current best is 500, we should explore by changing parameters by ±1.0. So perhaps changing one of the parameters in the top example by 1.0. 

Let me pick a parameter that's in the middle of the range. For example, params[1] is 2.3. Changing it by +1.0 to 3.3 or -1.0 to 1.3. But in the examples, when params[1] was 3.3, the reward was 354.80, which is worse. When it was 1.3, the reward was 497.35. So maybe changing params[1] to 1.3. But that example already exists. However, the user says not to propose previously seen params. So if that combination is already in the examples, we can't use it again. 

Looking at the examples, the one with params[1] at 1.3 is in the list. So we can't use that. So need to find a new combination. 

Another parameter to change could be params[5], which is 6.0. Changing it to 5.0. Let's see. So new params: params[5]:5.0. But I don't know the effect. 

Alternatively, params[6] is -6.0. Changing it to -5.0. But in the examples, that gave lower reward. 

Hmm, maybe I should look for parameters that are not at the extremes. For example, params[4] is 5.3. Changing it to 4.3 (which is 5.3 -1.0) or 6.3 (but capped at 6.0). Let's try 4.3. But in the examples, when params[4] was 4.3, the reward was 499.35. So that's slightly lower. 

Alternatively, maybe changing params[2] from -5 to -4. But in one example, that was tried with params[4] at 5.3, and the reward was 499.95. So that's close to 500. 

But the user says not to propose previously seen params. So if that's already in the examples, we can't use it. 

Looking back, the third example has params[2] at -4 and params[4] at 5.3, which gives 499.95. So that's a different set. So maybe changing params[2] from -5 to -6, but that would be a new set. 

So, new params: params[0]:6, params[1]:2.3, params[2]:-6, params[3]:6, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:6, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6, params[8]:5, params[9]:5. 

This hasn't been tried before in the examples provided. So that's a new set. Let's go with that.
