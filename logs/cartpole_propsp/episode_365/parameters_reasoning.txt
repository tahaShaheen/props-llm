SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 365 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to set up these parameters for the cartpole environment so that the policy optimizer can achieve a reward of 500, which is the goal they're aiming for. The parameters are in the range of -6.0 to 6.0 with one decimal place each.

First, I remember that the policy is linear and uses 18 parameters (W matrix has 4x2=8 elements and B vector has 2 elements). So, when someone provides these params, we can compute the episodic reward for a certain state trajectory.

Looking at the existing top performing params, they're already around 500. But I'm not sure if those are optimal or just the best among others. Maybe there's a way to tweak them slightly to get exactly 500.

I also notice that during exploration, we use a step size of 1.0 for searching. That probably means each parameter change is small, but it might be necessary to make precise adjustments since the reward depends on each parameter in a specific way.

Since the global optimum is around 500, I think maybe tweaking these params just a bit can push the total reward up by 2 or something. Maybe increasing some parameters and decreasing others strategically could balance things out without making any significant jumps that go beyond 500.

I should try modifying each parameter slightly, both in positive and negative directions, to see how it affects the reward. For example, I'll increase params[0] a bit, decrease params[1], etc., and check if the f(params) increases enough to reach exactly 500 or stay around that range.

I also need to make sure not to repeat any parameters from previous iterations because that could lead us back to similar results. So, I'll try one change at a time and see how it affects things.

Maybe after trying each param, I can calculate f(params) incrementally to ensure I'm on the right track without missing out on the optimal value.
