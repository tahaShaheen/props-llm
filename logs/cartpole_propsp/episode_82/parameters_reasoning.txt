SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 82 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to maximize the function f(params) for the cartpole environment. The goal is to get the pole upright and keep the cart within certain bounds. I've been given some parameters and their corresponding episodic rewards, which are like the cumulative points from each time step.

First, I see that the params array has 10 elements with decimal places, ranging from -6.0 to 6.0. That gives me a good range to explore. The user mentioned trying different param values, especially in regions where they've seen higher rewards. They’ve provided several examples, like when params[0] is 6.6 and others are set to certain values, resulting in varying rewards.

I notice that some parameters have negative values, which might help stabilize the pole but could cause the cart to move more. Positive values seem better for keeping the pole upright, so I should focus on increasing those parts of the params array.

The user wants me to propose new param values in the same range while trying to maximize f(params). Since I saw that some parameters like 6.6 and 5.7 resulted in higher rewards, maybe I can try a few more points around these regions. Let me think about what combinations would give me higher rewards.

I should consider varying params[0] and params[1], which are the first two elements of the array. Both seem important for balancing the pole. Maybe increasing both could lead to better rewards. Also, I might want to explore parameters like 5.7, -2.4, or other negatives to see if that helps.

Wait, in one example, when params[0] is 6.6 and others are set to certain values, it gave a reward of about 157.70. That's quite high, so I should aim to get close to that. Let me try tweaking the parameters around those values but also trying some other combinations.

I think I'll try different param ranges for each key parameter and see how they affect the reward. Maybe start with params[0] = 6.0, params[1] = -2.4, and see what happens. Then perhaps adjust other parameters a bit to balance things out.

Also, considering the negative values might be useful in some areas to prevent the pole from falling over. So I'll try including negative numbers here as well. For instance, maybe having a moderately positive value for params[0] and a more negative value for params[2] could help stabilize the cart movement without letting the pole fall.

After trying these combinations, I can see which ones give me higher rewards and adjust accordingly to move closer towards the global optimum of around 500. It's about iterative improvement based on reward feedback.
