SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 206 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has given me some examples of parameters and their corresponding episodic rewards. The goal is to find the global optimal policy, which they mentioned should be around 500. The current highest reward in the examples is 500.00, which comes from the first param set. But the user says that if I'm below that, I should explore instead of exploit. 

Looking at the examples, the top params have some commonalities. For instance, params[0], [3], [5], [7] are often 6, and [2], [6] are -6. The biases (params[8] and [9]) are around 5 or 6. However, the other parameters like [1], [4] vary a bit. The first example has params[1] as 2.3 and params[4] as 5.3, which might be part of the optimal set.

But the user mentioned that during exploration, I should use a step size of 1.0. So maybe I need to perturb some of the parameters that are near the current high-performing ones. Let's check the current top params again. The first one with 500.00 has params[0] to [7] as 6, -5, 6, -6, 5.3, 6, -6, 6. The biases are 5 and 5.

Wait, maybe I should look for parameters that are slightly different but could lead to higher rewards. For example, in the first example, params[2] is -5, but in another example, it's -6. Maybe changing that could help. Also, params[1] is 2.3; perhaps increasing or decreasing it by 1.0 would be a step. Let's try changing params[1] from 2.3 to 3.3 (as in one of the examples, but that gave a lower reward). Alternatively, maybe trying 1.3 or 3.3. But the user says to explore with step size 1.0, so if the current value is 2.3, adding or subtracting 1.0 would be 3.3 or 1.3. However, in the examples, 1.3 sometimes leads to lower rewards, but maybe there's a different combination.

Another thought: the first example has params[4] as 5.3. Maybe adjusting that to 6.3 or 4.3. But in the examples, 4.3 gave a lower reward. However, the user says to explore, so perhaps trying 6.3. But the parameters are limited to [-6.0, 6.0], so 6.3 is invalid. So the maximum is 6.0. So maybe trying 6.0 for params[4] instead of 5.3. Wait, but in the first example, params[4] is 5.3 and the reward is 500. Maybe increasing it to 6.0 could help. But I need to check if that's allowed. The parameters can be up to 6.0. So changing params[4] from 5.3 to 6.0 would be a step of +0.7, but the user said to use a step size of 1.0. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps changing params[4] by +1.0 (from 5.3 to 6.3, but that's over the limit). So maybe not possible.

Alternatively, looking at other parameters. Let's see, in the first example, params[2] is -5. If I change that to -6 (as in another example), but that example had a lower reward. But maybe that's part of a different combination. However, the user says to explore, so even if some parameters lead to lower rewards, maybe combining them with other changes could lead to higher.

Wait, the user's instruction says that during exploration, use a search step size of 1.0. So perhaps I need to take a step of 1.0 in some parameter direction. For example, if the current param is 2.3, adding or subtracting 1.0 gives 3.3 or 1.3. Let's consider that. Also, for parameters that are at the extremes, like 6.0, maybe they can't be increased further, but can be decreased.

Looking at the first example, which has the highest reward so far. Let's take that as a base and try to perturb it. The base is:

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5.

Now, let's consider which parameters to change. For example, params[1] is 2.3. Changing it to 3.3 (adding 1.0) or 1.3 (subtracting 1.0). Let's try both. Also, params[4] is 5.3; changing to 6.3 (invalid) or 4.3. But 4.3 is within the range. However, in one of the examples, when params[4] was 4.3, the reward was lower. But maybe combining that with other changes could help.

Alternatively, looking at params[8] and [9], which are 5 and 5. Increasing them to 6.0 might help. Let's try that. For example, changing params[8] to 6.0 and params[9] to 6.0. But in one of the examples, when both were 6, the reward was 497.35, which is lower than 500. So that might not be helpful. But maybe other parameters need to be adjusted in combination.

Another approach: check which parameters are not at the extremes. For example, params[1] is 2.3, which is not at the maximum (6.0) or minimum (-6.0). So changing it by 1.0 in either direction could be a step. Let's try changing params[1] from 2.3 to 3.3. Then, other parameters remain the same. But in one of the examples, when params[1] was 3.3, the reward was lower (306.35). That's way lower. So that might not be good. Alternatively, changing params[1] to 1.3. In one example, that gave 497.35, which is slightly lower than 500. So maybe that's not helpful.

What about other parameters? Let's look at params[2] which is -5. Changing it to -6 (step of -1.0) or -4 (step of +1.0). In the examples, when params[2] was -6, the reward was lower (like 497.35). But when it was -4, the reward was 499.95, which is very close to 500. So maybe that's a direction to explore. Let's consider changing params[2] from -5 to -4 (adding 1.0). Then, the new params would be:

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -4; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5.

But this is the second example, which had a reward of 499.95. So that's very close to 500. Maybe we can tweak other parameters. For instance, changing params[4] from 5.3 to 6.0. Let's try that. So params[4] becomes 6.0. Then, the new params would be:

params[0]:6; params[1]:2.3; params[2]:-4; params[3]:6; params[4]:6.0; params[5]:6; params[6]:-6; params[7]:6; params[8]:5; params[9]:5.

This is a new set of parameters. Let's see if that could lead to a higher reward. Since changing params[4] from 5.3 to 6.0 is a step of +0.7, but the user says to use a step size of 1.0. Hmm, but maybe that's not exactly a step of 1.0. Alternatively, maybe changing params[4] by +1.0 (from 5.3 to 6.3) is invalid. So the maximum is 6.0. So that's the closest possible. Maybe that's a valid step.

Alternatively, looking at params[8] and [9], which are 5 and 5. Increasing them to 6.0. Let's try that. So changing params[8] to 6.0 and params[9] to 6.0. Then, the params would be:

params[0]:6; params[1]:2.3; params[2]:-4; params[3]:6; params[4]:5.3; params[5]:6; params[6]:-6; params[7]:6; params[8]:6; params[9]:6.

In one of the examples, this set had a reward of 497.35. Which is lower than 500. So that might not help. But maybe combining with other changes.

Alternatively, changing params[8] to 6.0 and keeping params[9] at 5. Let's try that. So params[8] becomes 6.0. Then, the new set is:

params[0]:6; params[1]:2.3; params[2]:-4; params[3]:6; params[4]:5.3; params[5]:6; params[6]:-6; params[7]:6; params[8]:6; params[9]:5.

This is a new set. Maybe this could lead to a higher reward. But without knowing the actual function's value, it's hard to tell. However, the user is asking me to propose parameters based on exploration steps.

Another parameter to consider is params[4], which is 5.3. If I change it to 6.0 (as above), but that's a step of +0.7. Maybe that's not a full step. Alternatively, if I change it to 4.3 (step of -1.0), but that's in the example where the reward was lower.

Alternatively, looking at params[3], which is 6.0. Since that's already at the maximum, maybe decreasing it by 1.0 to 5.0. Let's try that. So changing params[3] from 6 to 5. Then, the new set would be:

params[0]:6; params[1]:2.3; params[2]:-4; params[3]:5; params[4]:5.3; params[5]:6; params[6]:-6; params[7]:6; params[8]:5; params[9]:5.

But this is a new set. Not sure about the reward, but it's a different configuration.

Alternatively, looking at params[7], which is 6.0. Changing it to 5.0 (step of -1.0). That could be another direction.

But considering the user's instruction to explore with a step size of 1.0, perhaps the best approach is to take one parameter that's not at the extremes and adjust it by +1.0 or -1.0. For example, in the current top example (params with reward 500.00), params[1] is 2.3ʎ. Changing that to 3.3 or 1.3. But earlier examples show that 3.3 leads to lower rewards. However, maybe other parameters need to be adjusted in combination. But without more information, it's hard to know.

Alternatively, considering that the user might want to try changing a parameter that's in the middle of the range. For example, params[4] is 5.3, which is close to 6.0. Maybe changing it to 6.0 (as above) could help, even though it's not a full step of 1.0. Alternatively, maybe changing another parameter.

Another parameter is params[5], which is 6.0. Since that's already at the maximum, can't increase it. Maybe decrease it by 1.0 to 5.0. Let's try that. So:

params[0]:6; params[1]:2.3; params[2]:-5; params[3]:6; params[4]:5.3; params[5]:5; params[6]:-6; params[7]:6; params[8]:5; params[9]:5.

This is a new set. Not sure about the reward, but it's a different configuration.

Alternatively, changing params[6] from -6 to -5 (step of +1.0). So:

params[0]:6; params[1]:2.3; params[2]:-5; params[3]:6; params[4]:5.3; params[5]:6; params[6]:-5; params[7]:6; params[8]:5; params[9]:5.

This is another new set. But again, without knowing the function's response, it's hard to predict.

Given all these possibilities, perhaps the best approach is to take the current highest reward example and make a small change in one parameter. For example, changing params[2] from -5 to -4 (as in the second example, which had 499.95). But that's very close to 500. Maybe that's not enough. Alternatively, changing params[4] from 5.3 to 6.0 (as above), even though it's not a full step of 1.0. Or maybe changing params[8] or [9] to 6.0.

Alternatively, considering that the user might want to try a different combination. For example, changing params[1] to 1.3 (step of -1.0) and params[8] to 6.0. Let's see:

params[0]:6; params[1]:1.3; params[2]:-5; params[3]:6; params[4]:5.3; params[5]:6; params[6]:-6; params[7]:6; params[8]:6; params[9]:5.

This is a new set. Not sure about the reward, but it's a different configuration.

Given the uncertainty, perhaps the best way is to propose a parameter set that is a single step from the current highest, even if it's a small change. For example, changing params[4] from 5.3 to 6.0, as that's within the allowed range and a step of +0.7. Even though it's not a full 1.0 step, it's the closest possible.

Alternatively, if the user insists on a step of exactly 1.0, then perhaps changing params[1] from 2.3 to 3.3 (even though that example had a lower reward) or to 1.3 (which is close to 500).

Given that the example with params[2] changed to -4 had a reward of 499.95, which is very close to 500, maybe that's a good candidate for further exploration. So changing params[2] from -5 to -4, and then tweaking other parameters.

But since the user is asking for a single proposal, perhaps the best is to take the current highest example and change one parameter by 1.0 step. For example, changing params[1] from 2.3 to 1.3 (step of -1.0), resulting in:

params[0]:6; params[1]:1.3; params[2]:-5; params[3]:6; params[4]:5.3; params[5]:6; params[6]:-6; params[7]:6; params[8]:5; params[9]:5.

This is a valid set, and even though the example with params[1] at 1.3 had a lower reward, it's possible that other parameters could be adjusted to improve it. However, without knowing the actual function's response, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, changing params[4] from 5.3 to 6.0 (as above). Let's proceed with that.
</think>

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 2.3; params[2]: -5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 6.0; params[5]: 6; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 5; params[9]: 5
