SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

params[0]: 1.2; params[1]: 2.8; params[2]: -4.3; params[3]: -5.6; params[4]: -0.8; params[5]: -3.9; params[6]: 0.7; params[7]: 3.2; params[8]: -0.3; params[9]: -0.7; f(params): 48.80
params[0]: -3.6; params[1]: -3.6; params[2]: -3.4; params[3]: -3.6; params[4]: -3.5; params[5]: -3.7; params[6]: -3.7; params[7]: -3.5; params[8]: -3.6; params[9]: -3.6; f(params): 47.25
params[0]: -3.6; params[1]: -3.6; params[2]: 1.5; params[3]: -3.3; params[4]: 5; params[5]: 0.7; params[6]: -3.4; params[7]: 4; params[8]: 2.8; params[9]: 3.6; f(params): 46.80
params[0]: -3.6; params[1]: 0.4; params[2]: -5.4; params[3]: -3.3; params[4]: 4; params[5]: 0.7; params[6]: -3.4; params[7]: 4; params[8]: 2.8; params[9]: 3.6; f(params): 77.10


Now you are at iteration 33 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to help improve my policy for the cartpole environment. The goal is to balance the pole as much as possible while keeping the cart within a certain range. The current parameters are being tested, and some results have been recorded.

I remember that each parameter's value can be adjusted between -6.0 and 6.0 with one decimal place. My task is to explore these parameters systematically to find the combination that maximizes the episodic reward. I'm using a linear policy where the action is determined by multiplying the state vector by the weight matrix W, then adding bias B.

Let me think about how to approach this. Since it's an exploration vs exploitation problem, I need to balance searching for better parameters without missing out on good ones yet. The user mentioned exploring with step size 1.0 during exploration and exploiting where possible.

Looking at the examples provided, when params[4] (pole angular velocity) is increased from -3.5 to 5, the reward drops significantly. This suggests that some directions in parameter space are detrimental. Conversely, other parameters like pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad) have more varied impacts.

I should focus on adjusting the parameters that have both positive and negative effects. For instance, params[3] (pole angular velocity) seems problematic when pushed too high or low. Similarly, params[2] (pole angle) has a bigger impact in extremes, so maybe tweaking it differently would help.

Perhaps I can start by increasing params[4] but keeping other parameters within more reasonable ranges where they have less of an effect on the reward. Also, considering that the reward is positive for upright pole and cart position within bounds, perhaps reducing some negative effects while improving others could be beneficial.

Maybe I should focus on balancing all parameters to find a sweet spot where increasing one parameter doesn't decrease the reward too much but maybe improves other aspects like pole stability or cart movement. Or perhaps there's an optimal point where all parameters are adjusted in such a way that they balance each other out for maximum reward.

I'll also need to be cautious not to over explore one parameter and miss others, so keeping them within their mean values could help stabilize the exploration process. Additionally, I should consider using random sampling around current best points when exploring new areas of the parameter space where rewards are low.

Perhaps I can set up a systematic grid search around the parameters that have more significant impacts on the reward. For example, if params[4] is highly influential, adjusting it more carefully while keeping other parameters in their average or adjusted ranges might yield better results.

Wait, but since this is an iterative process, maybe the best approach is to start with a range of each parameter, sample several points, and then iteratively refine which ones are worth exploring further based on their impact on reward. That way, I can focus more on parameters that have less pronounced effects initially and only allocate resources where they make a significant difference.

Another consideration is whether the current best parameters from previous iterations should guide my next exploration or if I need to start anew with new points. Since each iteration gives me the reward for a set of params, perhaps starting each new iteration with all params at their mean values would help in finding areas around where the current best is achieved.

Alternatively, maybe using an adaptive search strategy where I adjust the step sizes based on how much each parameter contributes to the expected reward could be more efficient. For example, if a parameter's adjustment leads to a small change in reward, I might focus less on it and explore others more thoroughly.

I should also consider whether using some form of gradient ascent or other optimization techniques would help, but since this is a discrete parameter space with 10 parameters each having up to one decimal place (so about 26 possible values per parameter), an exhaustive search isn't feasible. Instead, I need to use a systematic approach that samples points in the parameter space and evaluates their rewards.

Maybe I can perform a Monte Carlo simulation where I randomly sample points from the parameter space and select the ones with the highest reward as candidates for further exploration. Then, based on those, adjust which parameters to prioritize next.

Additionally, looking at the examples provided, when params[4] increases beyond -3.5, the reward starts dropping significantly. This suggests that increasing some negative impacts might not be beneficial, so perhaps I should focus on other parameters where their adjustment has less of an effect but could improve the overall state in a way that compensates for these negatives.

Perhaps I can also consider whether adding more exploration during each iteration would allow me to find better points without missing the current best. But that might slow down the process since each evaluation is computationally intensive.

I should also remember not to propose any parameters already used, as the user emphasized the need to explore new values without revisiting previous ones.

Overall, I think a good approach would be to:

1. Generate a set of randomly sampled points within the parameter space.
2. For each point, evaluate its episodic reward using the policy.
3. Keep track of which points yield high rewards.
4. Use these best points as candidates for further exploration.
5. Focus on exploring areas around these best points where their adjustments might lead to higher rewards without too much loss from other parameters.

This way, I can systematically explore regions that are more likely to contain the optimal parameter set without having to randomly sample every possible point in a vast parameter space.
