SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

Now you are at iteration 46 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of training examples where the params are mostly giving a reward of 500.00, which is the maximum possible. However, there are a few examples where the reward is lower, like 224.45 and 482.15. The goal is to find the global optimal policy, which the user mentioned should be around 500. But the examples show that many params already reach 500. So maybe the current params are already in a good region, but the user wants to ensure we're not stuck in a local optimum.

Looking at the params that gave 500, they have some common values. For instance, params[0] is 3.2, params[1] is 4.3, params[2] is 1.3, params[3] is 4.6, params[4] is -2.4, params[5] is 1.9, params[6] is -4.9, params[7] is -0.1, params[8] is 3.3, and params[9] is 4.2. But there are variations in some parameters, like params[8] and params[9] sometimes change, but the reward remains 500. That suggests that those parameters might not be critical, or there's some flexibility.

However, the user's instruction says that if we're below 500, we should explore instead of exploit. But in this case, most of the examples are already at 500. So maybe we need to check if there's a way to improve further. Wait, the user mentioned that the global optimum should be around 500, but the examples already reach that. So perhaps the current params are already optimal, but the user wants to confirm that there's no better solution.

But looking at the examples, some variations in params still give 500. So maybe the function is flat in some regions, and the optimal is already achieved. However, the user might be expecting us to explore further to ensure that there's no higher value. Alternatively, maybe the examples provided are just part of the training data, and the actual optimal is slightly higher.

Wait, the user's note says that if you are below 500, you should explore. But if you are at 500, you might be at the global optimum. However, the user also says that the global optimum should be around 500. So perhaps the examples are already at the optimal, and the answer is to keep the same params. But the user might want to check other possibilities.

Alternatively, maybe there's a better set of params that can achieve a higher reward. But the examples given have already reached 500.00, which is the maximum possible. Since the reward is +1 per step, and the maximum episode length is 500 steps (assuming that's the case), then 500.00 is the maximum possible reward. Therefore, any params that achieve 500.00 are already optimal.

So the answer would be to keep the same params as the ones that achieved 500.00. However, the user's instruction says not to propose previously seen params. But all the examples given have already achieved 500.00, so maybe the next step is to explore nearby values to see if there's any improvement, but since the maximum is already achieved, there's no need.

But the user might have a typo, or the maximum reward is actually higher. However, given the problem description, the maximum reward per episode is 500. So the answer is that the current params are optimal. Therefore, the best response is to propose a params that's similar but not exactly the same as the previous ones, but still within the range. However, since the user says not to propose previously seen params, we need to find a new set that's close but different.

Looking at the params that achieved 500, for example, the first one has params[8] as 3.3 and params[9] as 4.2. Another example has params[8] as 4.3 and params[9] as 4.2. Maybe changing those slightly. For instance, increasing params[8] to 3.4 and params[9] to 4.3. But we need to ensure that the values are within [-6.0, 6.0] and have one decimal place.

Alternatively, looking at other parameters. For example, params[6] is -4.9 in many examples. Maybe changing that to -3.9 or -5.9. But the user's instruction says during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So if we take a step of 1.0 from -4.9, that would be -5.9 or -3.9. But in the examples, those values have already been tried and still gave 500.00. So perhaps those are not critical.

Another parameter that varies is params[4], which is -2.4 in most cases, but in one example it's -3.4 and another -1.4. Those also gave 500.00. So maybe changing params[4] to -2.4 ±1.0, like -3.4 or -1.4, but again, those have been tried.

Given that, perhaps the best approach is to slightly perturb some parameters that haven't been changed much. For example, params[0] is 3.2 in most cases. Maybe increasing it to 4.2 or decreasing to 2.2. But in the examples, 4.2 was tried and gave 482.15, which is lower. So maybe not. Alternatively, changing params[7] from -0.1 to 0.9 or -1.1, which were tried and still gave 500.00.

So perhaps the optimal is already achieved, and the answer is to return a params that's similar but with minor changes. However, the user says not to propose previously seen params. Therefore, we need to find a new set. For example, changing params[10] (but wait, params is 10 elements, 0-9). So maybe changing params[7] from -0.1 to 0.0, or params[8] from 3.3 to 3.4. Let's pick a parameter that hasn't been changed much. For instance, params[2] is 1.3. Changing it to 1.4. But need to check if that's within the range.

So, the response could be:

params[0]: 3.2; params[1]: 4.3; params[2]: 1.4; params[3]: 4.6; params[4]: -2.4; params[5]: 1.9; params[6]: -4.9; params[7]: -0.1; params[8]: 3.3; params[9]: 4.2;

But I need to ensure that this hasn't been tried before. Looking at the examples, in one case params[2] was 2.3, 0.3, etc. So 1.4 is a new value. This would be a small step from 1.3 to 1.4, which is within the exploration step size of 1.0. However, the user might prefer to explore more broadly. Alternatively, changing params[0] from 3.2 to 4.2 (but that was tried and gave lower reward). So maybe better to stick with the current values but vary others.

Alternatively, changing params[8] from 3.3 to 3.4. That's a small step. Let's try that. So:

params[0]: 3.2; params[1]: 4.3; params[2]: 1.3; params[3]: 4.6; params[4]: -2.4; params[5]: 1.9; params[6]: -4.9; params[7]: -0.1; params[8]: 3.4; params[9]: 4.2;

This hasn't been seen before, so it's a new set. But since the reward is already 500.00 in previous examples, maybe it's safe to try. However, the user's instruction says to explore if below 500, but since we're already at 500, maybe we should not. But the user says the global optimum should be around 500, so maybe we can stop here. But the problem is that the user is expecting us to continue exploring until the maximum iterations.

But the user says that the global optimum is around 500, and the examples already reach that. Therefore, perhaps the answer is to return the same params as before, but the user says not to propose previously seen params. Hence, a slight variation is needed. Therefore, the best approach is to make a small change to one of the parameters that hasn't been altered much, like changing params[8] from 3.3 to 3.4.
