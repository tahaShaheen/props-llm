SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 62 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is working on optimizing a linear policy for the CartPole environment. They provided a bunch of training examples with different parameter values and their corresponding episodic rewards. The goal is to find the global optimum, which they mentioned should be around 500. The current iteration is 62 out of 400, so there's still a lot of steps left.

Looking at the examples, most of the high rewards (like 428, 426) come from params where certain values are set to 6 or -6, especially in params[0], [3], [6], [7], and [8], [9]. However, the rewards are still below 500, which is the target. The user's instruction says that if the current value is below 500, exploration is needed instead of exploitation. So, even though some parameters have high rewards, we need to explore more to find the optimal.

The exploration step size is 1.0, so I should adjust parameters that are currently at the extremes (like 6 or -6) by adding or subtracting 1.0. Let me check the examples again. For instance, in the first example, params[0] is 6, which is the max. Maybe decreasing it by 1.0 to 5 could help. Similarly, params[6] is -6; increasing it by 1.0 to -5 might be worth trying. Also, params[8] and [9] are 6 in some cases. Maybe reducing those to 5 could lead to better exploration.

Another thing to note is that some parameters like params[2] are set to -3 or -4. Maybe adjusting those as well. But since the user wants exploration, focusing on the parameters that are at the extremes would be better. Let's pick a few parameters to tweak. For example, take the first example with high reward (params[0]:6, [3]:6, [6]:-6, [7]:6, [8]:6, [9]:6). Let's adjust params[0] from 6 to 5, params[3] from 6 to 5, params[6] from -6 to -5, and keep others the same. That might open up new areas to explore.

Alternatively, maybe increasing some parameters that are lower. For example, in some examples, params[4] is 5.3 or 6. Maybe increasing that to 7.0, but wait, the parameters are limited to [-6.0, 6.0], so can't go beyond that. So, no. So the exploration has to stay within that range. So adjusting from 6 to 5, or -6 to -5.

Another approach: look for parameters that haven't been explored much. For example, in the given examples, most of the params are around 6 or -6, but maybe some parameters like params[1] are set to 1.3, 0.3, 2.3. Maybe trying different values there. For example, if params[1] is 1.3, maybe trying 2.3 or 0.3, but that's already in the examples. However, the user says not to propose previously seen params. So need to avoid those.

Wait, the user mentioned that during exploration, the step size is 1.0. So, for example, if a parameter is at 6, we can try 5 (6-1) or 7 (but 7 is beyond the limit, so only 5). Similarly, for -6, we can try -5. So, the idea is to take parameters that are at the extremes and move them inward by 1.0.

Looking at the first example again: params[0] is 6, params[3] is 6, params[6] is -6, params[7] is 6, params[8] and [9] are 6. Let's adjust each of these by -1 or +1 where possible. For example, params[0] becomes 5, params[3] becomes 5, params[6] becomes -5, params[7] becomes 5, params[8] becomes 5, params[9] becomes 5. That would be a big change, but maybe that's the way to explore new regions.

Alternatively, maybe only adjust one parameter at a time. But since the user allows exploration with step size 1.0, perhaps adjusting multiple parameters. However, the user might prefer a single step. But the instruction says to provide the next set of params. Let me think of a specific example.

Let's take the first example with the highest reward (428.05). The params are:

params[0]:6, [1]:1.3, [2]:-3, [3]:6, [4]:5.3, [5]:2.7, [6]:-6, [7]:6, [8]:6, [9]:6.

To explore, adjust the parameters that are at the extremes. So:

- params[0] (6) → 5
- params[3] (6) → 5
- params[6] (-6) → -5
- params[7] (6) → 5
- params[8] (6) → 5
- params[9] (6) → 5

So the new params would be:

params[0]:5, params[1]:1.3, params[2]:-3, params[3]:5, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:2.7, params[6]:-5, params[7]:5, params[8]:5, params[9]:5.

This is a possible move. However, I need to ensure that this hasn't been tried before. Looking at the examples provided, there's one where params[0] is 5, params[3] is 5, params[6] is -5, params[7] is 5, and params[8] and [9] are 5. For example, the 7th example has params[0]:5, [3]:5, [6]:-5, [7]:6, [8]:6, [9]:6. But in this case, the other parameters are different. So maybe this is a new combination.

Alternatively, maybe adjust only some of them. For example, decrease params[0] to 5, leave others as is. But the user wants exploration, so multiple changes might be better.

Another angle: looking at the parameters that have lower values. For example, params[2] is -3 in some examples. Maybe trying -4 or -2. But the user said to use a step size of 1.0 during exploration. So if it's -3, maybe -4 or -2. However, in the examples, there's already a case where params[2] is -4 (e.g., in the 10th example). So maybe avoid that.

Alternatively, check other parameters. For example, params[4] is 5.3 in some examples. Maybe increasing it to 6.3? No, because the max is 6.0. So can't. So maybe decrease it to 4.3. But that's already in some examples.

Hmm. Maybe the best approach is to take the highest reward example and adjust the parameters that are at the extremes (6 or -6) by 1.0. That would be the exploration step. So, adjusting params[0], [3], [6], [7], [8], [9] as mentioned earlier.

Thus, the proposed params would be:

params[0]:5, params[1]:1.3, params[2]:-3, params[3]:5, params[4]:5.3, params[5]:2.7, params[6]:-5, params[7]:5, params[8]:5, params[9]:5.

This should be a new set of parameters not seen before, and it's an exploration step from the high-reward example. Let's check if this is in the provided examples. Looking through the examples, I don't see this exact combination. The 7th example has params[0]:5, [3]:5, [6]:-5, [7]:6, [8]:6, [9]:6, but here [7] is 5 and [8],[9] are 5. So this is different. So it's a new set. That should be acceptable.
