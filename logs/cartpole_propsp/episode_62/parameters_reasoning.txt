SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 62 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help someone find the global optimal policy for the cartpole environment using this linear policy approach. The environment is a bit tricky because the pole has to stay upright and the cart can't go over a certain position. The reward system gives +1 every time step if the pole is upright and the cart is within bounds, otherwise it's negative.

They mentioned that each action is either -1 or 1 (push left or right). The policy function uses a linear model with parameters W and B. I remember the state is [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity], so there are four features in total. Since W has 18 parameters and includes some structure for each feature's weight, that makes sense.

The user wants me to follow an iterative approach where they'll provide training examples by choosing specific params values, then evaluate the policy with those params, and adjust them based on f(params) at each step until reaching a certain number of iterations. They provided a list of top performing params from previous runs, each with their reward and current iteration.

My task is to come up with new params within the given range that aim to maximize f(params). Since they are already doing good but perhaps could do better, I need to propose some values based on exploration in both positive and negative directions. The user suggested using a step size of 1.0 during exploration, so I'll follow that.

I think about which parameters have the most significant impact on performance. Parameters 2 (pole_angle) and 4 (cart_velocity) are likely critical because they affect the cart's motion. If these can be adjusted better, it might improve overall rewards. Also, parameters 0 (cart_position), 1 (cart_velocity), 5 (pole_angular velocity), and 6 (pole_angle) seem important for pole stability.

Maybe I'll tweak parameters around those areas to see if the cart's balance or pole's angle improves without making other parameters too extreme. For example, increasing parameter 0 a bit might help with cart position, while decreasing parameter 2 could improve pole angle.

I also consider that parameter 3 (pole_angular velocity) and 7 (cart_velocity) are connected through the state; perhaps adjusting one affects the other negatively or positively. It's a balance to find where it goes without overshooting extremes.

Putting this together, I'll suggest some adjusted values that explore both higher positions for cart, lower pole angles, and maybe increased pole velocity in an attempt to stabilize the system better. Let me make sure I'm within the allowed range of [-6.0, 6.0] and with one decimal place.
