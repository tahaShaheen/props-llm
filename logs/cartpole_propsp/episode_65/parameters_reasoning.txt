SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 65 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to find the global optimal policy for this cartpole environment using a linear policy network. The user has provided some parameters and their corresponding episodic rewards. My task is to select 40 values for params[0] through params[9], each with one decimal place, such that when plugged into f(params), it's as high as possible.

First, I need to understand the structure of the reward function. From what I see, the reward increases by +1 every time the pole is upright and the cart is within a certain position. If the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds, the episode ends with an episode reward of 0. So higher rewards are better.

Looking at the given examples, some parameters lead to higher rewards than others. For instance, params[0] being around 6.6 gives a reward of around 157.70, which is very high. Other combinations have lower rewards. The user's goal is to reach around 500, but it seems that with the given examples, some are at 99 or even less.

I should consider varying each parameter slightly and seeing how they affect the reward. Since parameters are in the range of -6.0 to 6.0, I can try adjusting each one to see if it improves the reward without making any other parameter worse off.

For example, increasing params[3] (the angular velocity of the pole) might help balance the pole better and keep it upright. Maybe raising it from -2.1 to -1.8 could make a difference. Similarly, adjusting params[0] and [1], which affect the cart's position and velocity, can influence how fast the cart moves and whether it stays within bounds.

I also need to ensure that other parameters don't become worse. For instance, if I increase params[3], I should check that params[2] (angle) isn't too negative because that might make the pole more prone to tipping over due to gravity.

It's possible that a combination of these adjustments could yield a higher reward without significantly negatively impacting others. Maybe starting with some parameters at their maximum and others adjusted based on how they affect the reward is a way forward. But since I can only set each parameter once, I have to be strategic about where to place them to maximize the overall reward.

After trying several combinations, if one doesn't perform well, I'll need to adjust it back or try a different approach. The key is to find that sweet spot where all parameters are contributing positively and collectively to the total reward.
