SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 111 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is working on optimizing a linear policy for the CartPole environment. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward, which they mentioned should be around 500. The current examples show that the highest reward so far is 492.25. But the user wants to reach the global optimum, which is likely higher.

Looking at the provided examples, the top-performing parameters have certain patterns. For instance, params[0], [1], [3], [5], [7], [8], [9] are often set to 6 or 5.3, 5.7, etc. However, some parameters like [2], [4], [6] are negative. Maybe there's a balance between positive and negative values here.

The user mentioned that during exploration, a step size of 1.0 should be used. Since the current best is around 492, which is below 500, exploration is needed. The previous attempts have mostly adjusted parameters in the positive range, but maybe tweaking some negative parameters could help.

Looking at the parameters, maybe params[2] and [6] are set to -6. Could increasing those to less negative values help? Or perhaps adjusting params[4] and [5] which are around 5.3 and 5.7. Also, the bias terms (params[8] and [9]) are often 6. Maybe lowering them slightly?

Another thing to consider is the action selection. The policy uses argmax on the linear combination. If the weights are too high, the action might be too aggressive. Maybe some parameters need to be adjusted to allow more nuanced decisions.

Since the user wants exploration, I should try changing some parameters by 1.0 step. For example, take the top example with 492.25 and adjust one parameter. Let's look at params[2] which is -6. Maybe changing it to -5 (since previous examples had -5 in some cases). Or perhaps adjusting params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3? Wait, but the range is [-6.0, 6.0], so 6.3 is invalid. So, maybe 6.0 is the max.

Alternatively, check if any parameters are at the edge of the range. For example, params[0] is 6, which is the maximum. Maybe reducing that to 5.0 and see if that allows other parameters to adjust better.

But since the user wants exploration, perhaps making a change that's not too small. Let's pick a parameter that's currently at a high value and decrease it. For example, params[0] is 6.0. Let's try 5.0. Also, maybe adjust params[2] from -6 to -5. Similarly, check other parameters.

Another approach: look for parameters that are the same across top examples and see where variation occurs. For instance, params[1] is consistently 1.3 in the top examples. Maybe that's a good value. However, in one example, it was 0.3 and the reward was lower. So keeping 1.3 might be better.

Alternatively, check if changing params[8] and [9] from 6 to 5 might help. But in some cases, they were 5 and the reward was lower. However, maybe combining changes in multiple parameters could lead to better results.

Wait, the user said during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So, for each parameter, we can add or subtract 1.0. Let's take the top example (params[0]: 6; params[1]: 1.3; params[2]: -6; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 5.7; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 6; params[9]: 6; f(params): 492.25) and perturb one parameter by 1.0. Let's pick params[2], which is -6. Adding 1.0 would make it -5. Similarly, maybe adjust params[6] from -6 to -5. Also, check if changing params[4] from 5.3 to 6.3 (but that's over 6.0, so 6.0). So, maybe set params[4] to 6.0.

Alternatively, adjust params[8] and [9] from 6 to 5. But that might lower the reward. However, since we need exploration, maybe try that.

Another thought: the current top example has params[2] and [6] at -6. Maybe increasing those to -5 could help. Let's try changing params[2] from -6 to -5 and params[6] from -6 to -5. Also, check if params[4] can be increased from 5.3 to 6.0. Let's make those changes and see.
