SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to get better at this cartpole environment with a linear policy. The goal is around 500 iterations, and I need to maximize the reward f(params). Let me break down what I know.

First, the state is [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]. Each parameter from params[0] to params[9] contributes differently to these states. The policy is a linear function, which means it's a simple affine transformation of the state into an action (push left or right).

I see that in the previous examples, higher reward values were achieved by certain combinations of parameters. For instance, having params[0] at -5 and params[1] at -2.4 gave a reward of 309.55. Other combinations had lower rewards like 275.30 or even 266.60.

Looking at the current iteration, I'm at step 111 with parameters that have a reward around 103. That's significantly lower than previous examples. My goal is to find better parameters that can push this reward higher towards 500.

I should consider increasing some of the positive parameters and maybe decreasing others. For example, params[2] was at 0.8 in previous good configurations. If I make it a bit higher, like 0.9, that might help with pole angle control. Also, increasing params[3], which was used as -0.7 before but perhaps could be more positive.

On the flip side, reducing parameters that are causing negative effects or high costs is important. For instance, params[4] was sometimes at -3.9, which was bad because it made pole angle go beyond bounds. Maybe increasing that to 1.1 would help with balancing.

I also notice that some negative parameters like params[6], params[7], and params[8] are quite low. Parameters like params[2] being positive might offset these negatives. So, perhaps adjusting them in the right direction could improve overall performance.

Maybe I should try increasing certain positive parameters and decreasing others to see if it helps balance the state transitions. For example, let's see what happens when I adjust params[2], params[3], and params[4] upwards, while making other parameters more negative where they were previously positive.

Alternatively, perhaps adjusting param[6] from -1.5 to 0.9 could help with pole angle control. Also, increasing param[8] might improve the bias of the policy's action selection.

I need to be careful not to overshoot in any direction because that might lead to poor performance or even policy instability. So I'll have to experiment with small adjustments each time and check if the reward increases as expected.

Let me try setting params[0]: -5, params[1]: 2.5, params[2]: 0.9, params[3]: 0.7, params[4]: -3.8, params[5]: 1.1, params[6]: 0.9, params[7]: 4.1, params[8]: -2.1, params[9]: -2.2. This change aims to push pole angle up and improve balance.

After applying these changes, I'll evaluate the reward again at each iteration to see if it's improving towards my goal. If not, I can adjust parameters further in subsequent steps.
