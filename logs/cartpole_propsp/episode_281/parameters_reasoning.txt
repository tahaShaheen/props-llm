SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.
--- TOP 3 BEST PERFORMING PARAMS ---
params[0]: 6; params[1]: 6; params[2]: -3; params[3]: 6; params[4]: -6; params[5]: 1.8; params[6]: -3.5; params[7]: 4.5; params[8]: -2.5; params[9]: -2.5; f(params): 500.00
params[0]: 6; params[1]: 6; params[2]: -3.5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: -6; params[5]: 1.8; params[6]: -3.5; params[7]: 4.5; params[8]: -2.5; params[9]: -2.5; f(params): 500.00
params[0]: -6; params[1]: -4.5; params[2]: 3; params[3]: 6; params[4]: -6; params[5]: 1.8; params[6]: -3.5; params[7]: 4.5; params[8]: -2.5; params[9]: -2.5; f(params): 500.00
--- MOST RECENT 2 PARAMS ---
params[0]: -6; params[1]: 6; params[2]: -3.5; params[3]: 6; params[4]: -6; params[5]: 1.8; params[6]: -3.5; params[7]: 4.5; params[8]: -2.5; params[9]: -2.5; f(params): 49.95
params[0]: -6; params[1]: 3; params[2]: 3; params[3]: 4.5; params[4]: -6; params[5]: 1.8; params[6]: -3.5; params[7]: 4.5; params[8]: -2.5; params[9]: -2.5; f(params): 132.05


Now you are at iteration 281 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to help someone optimize the cartpole environment's policy using a linear policy network. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward. Let me break down what they need.

First, from the description, the current params are in the range [-6.0, 6.0] with one decimal place. They've provided some examples of these params and their corresponding rewards (f(params)). But I can see that many of the top performers have f=params=500, which is already quite high.

The user wants to reach at least a reward of 500 by following specific steps. Each iteration they provide three parameters followed by the reward. They want me to continue this process until I find the right set or exceed 500.

Let me look at their examples:

1. params[0]:6, others as specified, f=500.
2. Similarly another one with same reward but different params[8] and [9].
3. Then a more recent example with lower reward (49.95) and parameters that include -6, 6, etc.

The most promising ones seem to have all the first two parameters set as 6 or -6, which is interesting because it flips between +1 and -1 for those actions, depending on how they're used in the policy network.

I should consider if there's a pattern here. The examples with f=500 start with params[0] = 6 but have varying others except perhaps some specific ones. Maybe the optimal is around certain points.

The user has already provided three iterations where f=500, so they've met that threshold. But maybe further exploration can find an even higher reward or confirm it's stable.

I need to suggest new parameters in a similar style. Let me think of combinations that have some 6s and -6s but different others. Also, perhaps keeping the same structure as previous successful ones but varying other params slightly.

For example:

params[0]:6, params[1]:6, params[2]:-3, params[3]:6, params[4]:-6, params[5]:1.8, params[6):-3.5, params[7]:4.5, params[8]-2.5, params[9]-2.5.

This is one of the top performers and gives 500. Maybe tweaking the middle parameters or others can help reach a similar reward without any changes except perhaps other ones.

Alternatively, I could vary some other parameters to see how they affect the result. But since f=500 is already achieved, maybe it's enough.

I should also consider if the current best params are varying in certain ways that might be causing issues. For example, having a pole angle beyond -0.418 or velocity too high could make the environment worse.

But looking at the examples, some have parameters like -3.5 for B[6], which is within range, but perhaps others can be adjusted to maintain balance.

I think the best approach is to provide slightly different combinations that still have the same structure and see if they reach 500 or improve further.
