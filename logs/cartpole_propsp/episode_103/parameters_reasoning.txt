SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 103 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to find the optimal policy for the cartpole environment using reinforcement learning. The goal is to balance the pole and keep it upright within a certain range of positions. 

First, I'll look at how the reward works: every time step where the pole is upright (within -0.418 radians) and the cart is within [-2.4, 2.4] meters, I get +1 point. If either condition isn't met, the episode ends.

The policy here is a linear one with 18 parameters stored in W and B. The reward function f(params) will help me determine which params are better by giving higher scores when the pole stays upright and cart remains within bounds for more steps.

I've noticed that using lower param values seems to result in lower f(params), while higher ones get a boost. This suggests that the optimal point is somewhere in between, possibly around 500 as mentioned before.

The user has shared some top params with their respective rewards: one at -5 and gets 309.55 points, another at -6 for 171.85 points. These indicate that lower initial param values can yield higher rewards in the early steps but might not scale well beyond a certain point.

I should try some intermediate values between these extremes to see how they fare. Maybe around -4 or so. 

Looking at the recent example where params were [-5, -2.4, 0.9, -0.7, -3.8, 1.1, -1.5, 4.1, -2.1, -2.2], f(params) was 204.75. This is pretty decent but not the highest I've seen yet.

I'll try to pick some values in between these extremes. Let's consider -6 for params[0] and 2.5 for others. That might balance out their effects on the reward function.

So, I'll set params as [-6.0, 2.5, ...]. Then I'll run through this setup in the RL algorithm to see if it improves the reward compared to previous attempts.
