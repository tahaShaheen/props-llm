SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

Now you are at iteration 103 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to optimize the parameters for a linear policy in the CartPole environment. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward, which they mentioned should be around 500. The current iteration is 103 out of 400, so there's still time for exploration.

Looking at the provided examples, the top rewards are around 492.25, which is close to 500 but not quite there. The parameters that achieved this have some patterns. For instance, params[0], [1], [3], [4], [5], [7], [8], [9] are often set to higher values like 6, 5.3, 5.7, etc. However, some parameters like [2], [6] are negative, such as -6 or -5. 

But the user mentioned that if the reward is below 500, it's a local optimum and they should explore more. The current best is 492.25, so there's room for improvement. The exploration step size is 1.0, so maybe adjusting some parameters that are currently at the extremes (like 6 or -6) by adding or subtracting 1.0 could lead to better results.

Looking at the parameters that achieved 492.25, they have params[0] and [1] at 6 and 1.3, params[2] and [3] at -6 and 6, and so on. Maybe tweaking some of these values. For example, if params[2] is -6, maybe increasing it to -5 (since that's a step of 1.0) could help. Similarly, checking if params[4] and [5] could be adjusted from 5.3 and 5.7. Also, the bias terms (params[8] and [9]) are at 6, but maybe reducing them slightly could help.

Another thing to consider is diversity in the parameters. The examples provided have some repetition, so introducing new combinations might be necessary. For instance, changing params[1] from 1.3 to 2.3 (as in one of the examples) gave a lower reward, but maybe other changes could be better.

I should also check if any parameters are at the lower bound (-6) or upper bound (6) and see if perturbing them could lead to higher rewards. For example, params[2] is -6 in several high-reward examples. Maybe increasing it to -5 and seeing if that helps. Similarly, params[3] is 6 in some cases; reducing it to 5 might be worth trying.

Another approach is to look for parameters that are not at the extremes. For example, params[1] is 1.3 in many cases. Maybe trying 0.3 or 2.3 could yield different results. However, in one example, changing params[1] to 2.3 resulted in a much lower reward, so that might not be the right direction. But perhaps other parameters could benefit from similar adjustments.

Also, the bias terms (params[8] and [9]) are often set to 6. Maybe reducing them to 5 or even lower could help in some cases. Alternatively, increasing them further, but since the upper bound is 6, that's already the maximum.

I need to ensure that the new parameters proposed haven't been seen before. Looking at the examples, some combinations are repeated. So, introducing a new set where maybe params[2] is -5 instead of -6, or params[4] is 6 instead of 5.3, could be a way to explore new areas.

Putting this all together, a possible next step is to take one of the high-performing parameters, like the one with 492.25, and adjust some of the parameters that are at the extremes. For example, changing params[2] from -6 to -5, params[6] from -6 to -5, and maybe adjusting params[8] and [9] from 6 to 5. This would create a new set of parameters that haven't been tried yet and could potentially lead to higher rewards.
