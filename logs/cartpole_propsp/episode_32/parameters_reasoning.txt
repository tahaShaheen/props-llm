SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.
params[0]: -3.6; params[1]: 0.4; params[2]: -5.4; params[3]: -3.3; params[4]: 3.2; params[5]: 0.8; params[6]: -3.4; params[7]: 4; params[8]: 2.8; params[9]: 3.6; f(params): 88.35
params[0]: -3.6; params[1]: 0.4; params[2]: -5.4; params[3]: -3.3; params[4]: 5; params[5]: 0.7; params[6]: -3.4; params[7]: 4; params[8]: 2.8; params[9]: 3.6; f(params): 86.40
params[0]: 6; params[1]: -3; params[2]: 1.5; params[3]: 2.8; params[4]: 1.5; params[5]: -0.2; params[6]: -1; params[7]: 4.7; params[8]: 3.3; params[9]: 2.2; f(params): 61.65
params[0]: -2.1; params[1]: 1.2; params[2]: 2.8; params[3]: -4.3; params[4]: 1.9; params[5]: 2.8; params[6]: -1.7; params[7]: -0.7; params[8]: -2.8; params[9]: -1.1; f(params): 53.00
params[0]: 1.2; params[1]: 2.8; params[2]: -4.3; params[3]: -5.6; params[4]: -0.8; params[5]: -3.9; params[6]: 0.7; params[7]: 3.2; params[8]: -0.3; params[9]: -0.7; f(params): 48.80
params[0]: -3.6; params[1]: -3.6; params[2]: -3.4; params[3]: -3.6; params[4]: -3.5; params[5]: -3.7; params[6]: -3.7; params[7]: -3.5; params[8]: -3.6; params[9]: -3.6; f(params): 47.25
params[0]: -3.6; params[1]: -3.6; params[2]: 1.5; params[3]: -3.3; params[4]: 5; params[5]: 0.7; params[6]: -3.4; params[7]: 4; params[8]: 2.8; params[9]: 3.6; f(params): 46.80
params[0]: -3.6; params[1]: 0.4; params[2]: -5.4; params[3]: -3.3; params[4]: 5; params[5]: 0.7; params[6]: -3.4; params[7]: 4; params[8]: 2.8; params[9]: 3.6; f(params): 86.40


Now you are at iteration 32 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to find the global optimal policy for the cartpole environment using reinforcement learning. The user mentioned that this is a 2D world with a pole on a cart, which needs to balance itself upright on the cart without falling over. The state includes the cart's position, velocity, pole angle, and angular velocity.

The policy they're using is linear, which means it's modeled as action = argmax(state @ W + B), where state is [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]. The parameters are 18 in total, spread out over four equations. So, the goal is to find the optimal values for these 18 parameters.

The reward function gives +1 every time step if the pole is upright (within -0.418 radians) and the cart is within [-2.4, 2.4]. Otherwise, it's zero. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

The user provided some training examples with parameters and their corresponding f(params). Now, I need to provide new params values based on these examples and see how the reward changes.

Looking at the first example:
params[0]: -3.6; params[1]: 0.4; params[2]: -5.4; params[3]: -3.3; params[4]: 5; params[5]: 0.7; params[6]: -3.4; params[7]: 4; params[8]: 2.8; params[9]: 3.6; f(params): 88.35

In the second example, the parameters are:
params[0]: -3.6; params[1]: 0.4; params[2]: -5.4; params[3]: -3.3; params[4]: 5; params[5]: 0.7; params[6]: -3.4; params[7]: 4; params[8]: 2.8; params[9]: 3.6; f(params): 86.40

Comparing these, the only difference is in the cart velocity parameter (params[4]). In both cases, it's 5. So, the reward decreased from 88 to 86. Therefore, increasing params[4] by a small amount seems to improve performance.

Looking at the third example:
params[0]: 6; params[1]: -3; params[2]: 1.5; params[3]: 2.8; params[4]: 1.5; params[5]: -0.2; params[6]: -1; params[7]: 4.7; params[8]: 3.3; params[9]: 2.2; f(params): 61.65

Here, cart velocity is -3, which seems worse than the previous examples. The reward went from 86 to 61. So, a lower velocity isn't good and worsens performance.

Another example:
params[0]: -2.1; params[1]: 1.2; params[2]: 2.8; params[3]: -4.3; params[4]: 1.9; params[5]: 2.8; params[6]: -1.7; params[7]: -0.7; params[8]: -2.8; params[9]: -1.1; f(params): 53.00

Here, the velocity is positive (1.9) but not as high as before. Reward went from 61 to 53. So, a lower velocity is better than 4.7 but higher than 2.8. Hmm.

The fourth example:
params[0]: -3.6; params[1]: -3.6; params[2]: -3.4; params[3]: -3.6; params[4]: -3.5; params[5]: -3.7; params[6]: -3.7; params[7]: -3.5; params[8]: -3.6; params[9]: -3.6; f(params): 47.25

Here, the velocity is lower (-3.5). Reward went from 61 to 47. So, a higher negative velocity (more negative) reduces performance.

The fifth example:
params[0]: -3.6; params[1]: 0.4; params[2]: -5.4; params[3]: -3.3; params[4]: 5; params[5]: 0.7; params[6]: -3.4; params[7]: 4; params[8]: 2.8; params[9]: 3.6; f(params): 86.40

In this case, cart velocity is positive (5), which improved performance compared to the second example where it was 0.4.

So, from these examples, I see that increasing the cart velocity parameter (params[4]) seems beneficial as it increases reward, while making it too low leads to higher negative rewards and lower performance.

I should test parameters around these values, but maybe try a range of params[4] between -3.5 and 6 or something. But perhaps starting with params[4] as 4.0 might be a good balance since it was positive in the fifth example.

So, I'll propose params[4] = 4.0 and leave others as per the examples to see how f(params) changes.
