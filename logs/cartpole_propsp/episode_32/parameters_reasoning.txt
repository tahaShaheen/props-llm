SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of training examples for the CartPole environment with different parameter values and their corresponding episodic rewards. The goal is to find the global optimal policy, which they mentioned should be around 500. The current highest reward from the examples is 398.45, so there's room for improvement.

First, I need to analyze the existing parameters to see what patterns might lead to higher rewards. Looking at the top examples, the first one has params[0] at 6, params[1] at 0.3, params[2] at -4, params[3] at 6, and so on. The rewards here are in the 300s, but the highest is 398.45. However, the user says the global optimum is around 500, so maybe we need to explore more.

The user mentioned that during exploration, a search step size of 1.0 should be used. So, I should consider varying the parameters by ±1.0 from the current values. But I need to avoid repeating previously seen params. Let's check the existing parameters to see which ones are already used.

Looking at the examples, some parameters are repeated, like params[0] at 6, params[3] at 6 or 6.2, params[8] and [9] at 6 or 5.3. Maybe increasing some of the positive values or adjusting the negative ones could help. Also, the bias terms (params[8] and [9]) are often around 4.3 to 6. Maybe adjusting those could influence the action selection more effectively.

Another thing to note is that the current highest reward is 398.45. To reach 500, we might need to find a better combination. Perhaps some parameters that were previously set to lower values could be increased. For example, params[2] is often set to -4 or -5. Maybe increasing that to -3 or even positive values could help? But that's a guess. Alternatively, looking at the weights for the pole angle (params[4] and [5]) which are around 4.3 and 1.7. Maybe increasing those could make the policy more responsive to the pole's angle.

Wait, but the user said to use a step size of 1.0 during exploration. So, if I take the current best parameters (the first one with 398.45) and adjust each parameter by ±1.0, that might be a good approach. Let's take that example:

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 0.3; params[2]: -4; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 4.3; params[5]: 1.7; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 6; params[9]: 6.

If I increase params[2] from -4 to -3 (since that's a step of +1.0), or maybe decrease it further to -5. Also, check params[4] and [5]. Maybe increasing params[4] to 5.3 or 5.2? But in the examples, some have higher values. Alternatively, maybe adjusting the bias terms. For example, params[8] and [9] are at 6. Maybe lowering them to 5.3 or 4.3, but that's a step of -1.0.

Alternatively, looking at other parameters. For instance, params[1] is at 0.3. Maybe increasing that to 1.3 or 2.3? But in the examples, there's a param with params[1] at 1.3, which had a lower reward. Hmm. Maybe that's not the direction.

Another approach: look for parameters that are at the extremes (like 6 or -6) and see if adjusting them could help. For example, params[0] is at 6. Maybe reducing it to 5 or 4? But in the examples, when params[0] was 5, the reward was lower. So perhaps keeping it at 6 is better. Similarly, params[3] is at 6. Maybe increasing to 7.2? But the user said parameters are in the range [-6.0, 6.0], so 7.2 is out of bounds. Wait, the user specified that params are in the range [-6.0, 6.0], so any adjustment must stay within that. So, for example, params[3] can't go beyond 6.0.

So, considering that, maybe adjusting some parameters that are at the lower end. For example, params[2] is at -4. Maybe increasing to -3. Similarly, params[6] is at -6. Maybe increasing to -5. Also, params[7] is at 6. Maybe decreasing to 5.2 or 5.0?

Alternatively, looking at the other parameters. For instance, in the first example, params[4] is 4.3 and params[5] is 1.7. Maybe increasing params[5] to 2.7? But in one of the examples, params[5] was 2.7 and the reward was 291.95, which is lower than 398. So that might not be helpful.

Another angle: the policy is a linear function, so the weights and biases determine the action. The action is the argmax of the linear combination. So, perhaps the optimal parameters are those that make the linear function more sensitive to the state variables that are critical for balancing the pole, like the pole angle and angular velocity.

In the existing examples, params[4] and [5] (which correspond to pole angle and angular velocity) are often around 4.3 and 1.7. Maybe increasing those could make the policy react more strongly to the pole's position. For example, increasing params[4] to 5.3 or 5.2, and params[5] to 2.7. However, in some examples, those higher values led to lower rewards, so maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, looking at the bias terms (params[8] and [9]). If they are too high, the policy might always choose one action. Maybe adjusting them to lower values could allow for more balanced decision-making. But in the first example, the bias terms are at 6, which might be pushing the action towards one side. Maybe reducing them to 5.3 or 4.3?

But how to decide which parameters to adjust? Since the user says to explore with a step size of 1.0, I need to generate new parameters by modifying the current best ones (the one with 398.45) by ±1.0 in some parameters, while keeping others the same. But I need to avoid repeating previous params. Let me check the existing ones again.

The first example is:

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 0.3; params[2]: -4; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 4.3; params[5]: 1.7; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 6; params[9]: 6.

So, to explore, I can adjust one or more parameters by ±1.0. Let's try changing params[2] from -4 to -3 (since that's a step of +1.0). Then, maybe also adjust params[4] from 4.3 to 5.3. Also, adjust params[8] and [9] from 6 to 5.3. Let's see:

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 0.3; params[2]: -3; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 1.7; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 5.3; params[9]: 5.3.

This would be a new set of parameters, not seen before in the examples. Alternatively, changing params[6] from -6 to -5, and params[7] from 6 to 5.2. That might also be a good exploration step.

Another possibility: increase params[1] from 0.3ᐠ to 1.3 (a step of +1.0). But in some examples, that led to lower rewards, but maybe with other parameter changes, it could be better.

Alternatively, decrease params[3] from 6 to 5.0. But that might reduce the influence of that state variable.

I think the key is to make a few changes with step size 1.0 to the current best parameters. Let's pick one parameter to change. For example, let's take the first example and increase params[2] from -4 to -3. That's a step of +1.0. So:

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 0.3; params[2]: -3; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 4.3; params[5]: 1.7; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 6; params[9]: 6.

This is a new parameter set. Let's check if it's in the existing examples. Looking through the list, I don't see this exact combination. So that's a valid exploration step. Another option is to increase params[4] from 4.3 to 5.3. Let's try that:

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 0.3; params[2]: -4; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 5.3; params[5]: 1.7; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 6; params[9]: 6.

This is another new set. Alternatively, changing params[8] and [9] from 6 to 5.3. Let's do that:

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 0.3; params[2]: -4; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 4.3; params[5]: 1.7; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 5.3; params[9]: 5.3.

This is another new set. Maybe trying one of these. Since the user wants exploration, any of these steps could be a good candidate. I'll pick one of them. Let's go with changing params[2] from -4 to -3 and also adjust params[8] and [9] from 6 to 5.3. That gives:

params[0]: 6; params[1]: 0.3; params[2]: -3; params[3]: 6; params[4]: 4.3; params[5]: 1.7; params[6]: -6; params[7]: 6; params[8]: 5.3; params[9]: 5.3.

This is a new parameter combination, not seen before. It's a step of +1.0 in params[2] and -0.7 in params[8] and [9], but since the step size is 1.0, maybe adjusting those to 5.3 is acceptable. Alternatively, if I change params[8] and [9] to 5.0, but 5.3 is within the allowed range.

Alternatively, maybe changing multiple parameters. For example, increasing params[4] to 5.3 and decreasing params[8] and [9] to 5.3. That could be another approach. But I need to make sure not to repeat existing parameters.

In any case, the key is to generate a new parameter set that's within the bounds and hasn't been tried before. Based on that, I'll proceed with the first suggestion: adjusting params[2] from -4 to -3 and params[8] and [9] to 5.3.
