SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to find the optimal policy for the cartpole environment using a linear policy as described. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward by adjusting the parameters of the policy.

First, I understand that the policy is linear and has 18 parameters (2 actions x 9 params). Each parameter can vary between -6.0 and 6.0 with one decimal place precision. The current setup provides some examples of parameter values and their corresponding rewards, but I don't have a direct interaction or feedback mechanism yet.

Since we're only looking for the global optimum around a reward value of 500, which is considered local here, I need to explore more parameter combinations systematically. The search step size is set at 1.0 during exploration, so it's manageable but thoroughness is key.

I should focus on parameters that have the most significant impact on the reward. From the examples provided, the pole angle and cart velocity seem crucial because they directly affect balance and movement stability. So I'll prioritize adjusting these two parameters heavily while keeping others within a reasonable range to prevent over-sensitivity or unnecessary complexity.

Starting with params[2] (-1.8) as it's more influential than, say, param 3 (0.7), which might not be as critical. Similarly, params[5] (1.1) is another important factor affecting the cart's movement and pole stability.

I'll also need to consider how these parameters interact with others. For instance, increasing a parameter could improve the pole angle and balance but might also make it harder for the pole to stay upright if the cart moves too quickly. It's a trade-off that needs careful consideration based on the current reward.

Additionally, looking at the exploration strategy—since each step in the search increases a parameter by 1.0—I can methodically go through each parameter, adjusting them one by one and evaluating the resulting reward. This way, I ensure that each parameter contributes meaningfully to improving the policy's performance without unnecessary detours.

I should also be cautious about overextending parameters beyond their effective range because extremes might lead to instability in the system, which could result in a lower reward or even an episode termination. Balancing within the acceptable range is essential for both safety and reward optimization.

Finally, after several iterations, I can observe how the reward stabilizes around 500, indicating that further exploration isn't necessary. The current best parameters from the examples might already be close to optimal, so fine-tuning each parameter accordingly could lead us to the global optimum within the given constraints.
