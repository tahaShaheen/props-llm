SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

Now you are at iteration 32 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user is working on optimizing a linear policy for the CartPole environment. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward, which they mention should be around 500. They've provided a bunch of training examples where the reward is either 500 or lower. Now, they're at iteration 32 out of 400 and need the next set of parameters.

Looking at the examples, most of the params that gave 500 had certain values. For instance, params[0] is 3.2, params[1] is 4.3, params[2] is 1.3, params[3] is 4.6, params[4] is -2.4, params[5] is 1.9, params[6] is -4.9, params[7] is -0.1, params[8] is 3.3, and params[9] is 4.2. However, some variations in these parameters led to lower rewards, like when params[8] was changed to 5.3, the reward dropped. Also, changing params[1] to 5.3 resulted in a lower reward.

The user mentioned that during exploration, they should use a search step size of 1.0. So, maybe I should look for parameters that are slightly different from the current ones but within the range of [-6.0, 6.0]. Since the previous examples had some parameters at the extremes (like -6.0 or 6.0), maybe adjusting those could help. However, the examples that gave 500 had params like -4.9, -2.4, etc., which are close to the lower end.

Wait, the user also said that if they're below 500, they should explore instead of exploit. But in the examples, many of the params gave exactly 500. Maybe there's a plateau here, and the global optimum is around 500. However, the user's note says the global optimum should be around 500, so maybe the current examples are already near that. But perhaps there's a way to tweak some parameters to get slightly higher.

Looking at the parameters that gave lower rewards, like when params[8] was 5.3 and params[9] was 5.2, but that still gave 500. Hmm. Maybe trying to adjust other parameters. For example, in the example where params[7] was changed from -0.1 to 1.9, the reward dropped to 484.40. So, maybe the original values for params[7] are better.

Another thing to note is that the parameters that gave 500 had params[8] as 3.3 and params[9] as 4.2 or similar. Maybe trying to adjust those. But the user said not to propose previously seen params. So, I need to find new combinations.

Since the search step size is 1.0 during exploration, maybe adding or subtracting 1.0 from some parameters. For example, taking the current best params (like the ones with 500) and changing one parameter by 1.0. Let's see:

Take the first example where params[0] is 3.2. Adding 1.0 would make it 4.2, subtracting would make it 2.2. But I need to check if those have been used before. The user provided examples with params[0] as 3.2, so maybe trying 4.2 or 2.2. However, looking at the examples, some parameters are already at 4.3 or 5.3, but those didn't give 500.

Alternatively, looking at params[6] which was -4.9. If I change that to -5.9 or -3.9. But in the examples, -5.9 and -3.9 were tried and still gave 500. So maybe that's not the way.

Wait, the user's note says that the global optimum should be around 500, so maybe the current examples are already near that. However, the user is at iteration 32, so there's still time to explore. Maybe trying to adjust some parameters that haven't been changed much. For example, params[4] is -2.4 in most examples. What if we change that to -3.4 or -1.4? In the examples, changing params[4] to -3.4 gave 500, but to -1.4 gave 448.80. So maybe -2.4 is better.

Another parameter is params[7], which was -0.1 in most examples. Changing that to 0.9 or -1.1. In the examples, those were tried but still gave 500. So maybe that's not the key.

Looking at params[8] and params[9], which are the bias terms. In some examples, they were 3.3 and 4.2, others had 4.3 and 4.2. Maybe adjusting those. For example, trying params[8] as 2.3 or 4.3. But in the examples, 2.3 was tried and gave 500.

Hmm, this is tricky. Since the user said to explore with step size 1.0, maybe pick a parameter that's in the middle and adjust it. Let's pick params[2], which is 1.3. Adding 1.0 gives 2.3, subtracting gives 0.3. Both have been tried in the examples and gave 500. So maybe that's not helpful.

What about params[5], which is 1.9. Changing it to 2.9 or 0.9. In the examples, 2.9 was tried (with other changes) and gave 500. But in one example, changing params[5] to 0.9 (but other parameters changed) gave 484.40. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe look for parameters that haven't been varied much. For example, params[0] is 3.2, params[1] is 4.3, params[2] is 1.3, params[3] is 4.6, params[4] is -2.4, params[5] is 1.9, params[6] is -4.9, params[7] is -0.1, params[8] is 3.3, params[9] is 4.2. Maybe changing params[0] to 4.2 (adding 1.0) and see. But I need to make sure it's not previously used. Looking back, in the examples, there was a params[0] of 3.2, 4.3, 5.3, 2.2 (from subtracting 1.0). So 4.2 hasn't been used yet. Let me check the examples again.

Looking at the examples, one had params[0] as 3.2, another as 4.3, another as 5.3, but not 4.2. So maybe trying 4.2 for params[0]. Let's say:

params[0]: 4.2; params[1]: 4.3; params[2]: 1.3; params[3]: 4.6; params[4]: -2.4; params[5]: 1.9; params[6]: -4.9; params[7]: -0.1; params[8]: 3.3; params[9]: 4.2. 

This hasn't been used before. But I need to check all previous examples. Wait, the user provided several examples where some parameters were changed, but this combination might be new. Alternatively, changing another parameter. For example, params[7] from -0.1 to 0.9 (but that was tried and gave 500). So maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, changing params[6] from -4.9 to -5.9 (which was tried and gave 500) or -3.9 (also tried). So maybe that's not helpful.

Another approach: since the reward is already 500 in many cases, maybe the optimal is indeed around there, and the user needs to explore further. Maybe trying to adjust multiple parameters. For example, increasing params[1] from 4.3 to 5.3 (but that was tried and gave lower reward). So not helpful. Alternatively, decreasing params[1] to 3.3. But that hasn't been tried yet.

So, maybe trying:

params[0]: 3.2; params[1]: 3.3; params[2]: 1.3; params[3]: 4.6; params[4]: -2.4; params[5]: 1.9; params[6]: -4.9; params[7]: -0.1; params[8]: 3.3; params[9]: 4.2. 

This changes params[1] from 4.3 to 3.3. Since that hasn't been tried before, it's a new parameter set. Alternatively, changing params[3] from 4.6 to 5.6 (but that was tried in one example, giving 500). So maybe not.

Alternatively, changing params[8] from 3.3 to 4.3 (as in one example, which gave 500). But that's already been tried.

Hmm, this is challenging. The user wants to avoid previously seen params. Let me check all the previous examples again to ensure the new parameters are not duplicates.

Looking back, the first example had params[0] as 3.2, params[1] as 4.3, params[2] as 1.3, params[3] as 4.6, params[4] as -2.4, params[5] as 1.9, params[6] as -4.9, params[7] as -0.1, params[8] as 3.3, params[9] as 4.2. Then in the next example, params[8] was 4.3, which was different. Then another example with params[6] as -3.9, -5.9, -6.0, etc. So, perhaps changing params[6] to -3.9 again? Wait, but that was already tried and gave 500. So maybe not.

Another idea: change params[7] from -0.1 to 0.9 (which was tried, but in that case, the reward was 500). So maybe that's okay. But the user said not to propose previously seen params. Wait, in the examples, there was an entry where params[7] was 0.9 and gave 500. So if I use that again, it's a duplicate. So need to avoid that.

What about changing params[4] from -2.4 to -3.4? That was tried and gave 500. So that's not new. How about changing params[5] from 1.9 to 0.9? In one example, changing params[5] to 0.9 (but other parameters were also changed) gave 484.40. So that's worse. Not helpful.

Alternatively, changing params[2] from 1.3 to 2.3 (which was tried and gave 500). So that's already done.

Hmm. Maybe the best approach is to take the current best parameters (the ones that give 500) and perturb one parameter by 1.0. For example, take the first example and change params[0] from 3.2 to 4.2 (adding 1.0). Since that hasn't been tried before, it's a new parameter set. Let's go with that.
