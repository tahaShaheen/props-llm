SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to find the global optimal policy for this cartpole environment. The user mentioned that the goal is around 500, which suggests it's a challenging optimization problem where you need to explore thoroughly rather than just exploit the current best solution.

First, I remember that in reinforcement learning, especially when dealing with parameterized policies like linear policies as described here, the performance can be highly dependent on the parameters. The policy is defined by 18 parameters (W has 9 elements and B has 9), so the search space for these parameters isn't too large, but it's manageable.

The user provided some examples where different parameter values lead to varying f(params) rewards. For instance, when params[0] was set to -6, the reward was 195.60, which is quite high. On the other hand, when params[0] was increased beyond that, like to 6 or even higher, the reward started to decrease.

I notice that some parameters are consistently at their extremes while others vary. For example, params[3] and [7] seem to be around -0.7, which is interesting because it's a common value in these types of policies. The other parameters are more varied but still within reasonable bounds.

The goal is to maximize f(params), so I should focus on increasing the reward as much as possible. From the examples given, when params[0] was set to -6, the reward was very high, around 195.60. When params[0] was increased slightly or even more, the reward started to drop again.

I think the key is to find a balance where increasing certain parameters can lead to higher rewards without causing other parameters to decrease below their minimal acceptable levels. For example, if I increase params[2], which affects the pole angle's velocity, that could improve the situation for balancing the pole but might affect other aspects of the system.

Also, since the policy is a linear one, any deviation from the optimal point could lead to a suboptimal reward. So, it's crucial to carefully adjust each parameter without causing too much harm to the others.

In my interaction with the system, I should focus on adjusting params that seem promising based on their examples. For instance, since params[0] and [1] are consistently at -6 or 6.6 in some examples, maybe tweaking them could provide a better reward. Also, considering how params[2], [3], etc., affect the system's dynamics might help fine-tune the policy.

I need to be cautious not to go too far with any single parameter because it might counteract the benefits of others. For example, if I make params[0] too high, it could penalize other parameters more significantly in their respective examples.

Overall, my strategy should involve systematically varying each parameter within its possible range while monitoring the resulting f(params) to find where the reward is maximized without causing too much disruption to the system's performance.
