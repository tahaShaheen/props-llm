SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 97 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.

Alright, I need to figure out what parameters to choose for the cartpole environment to maximize the reward. The goal is to balance the pole and keep it upright within specific bounds while keeping the cart within a certain position.

Looking at the provided examples, some of them have negative values in params[0] and [2], which might help stabilize the pole. For instance, params like [-5; -2.4; 0.8; etc.] result in higher rewards, around 309 or more. These seem promising because they're positive and don't make the cart too far from zero.

I should also consider the other parameters. Since the reward is maximized when the pole is upright, having a negative angle (params[2]) would help maintain balance. However, if it's too negative, the pole might fall over quickly. But in these examples, params[2] is around 0.8, which seems sufficient.

I also notice that some parameters are positive and others negative. For example, [-6; -2.4; ...], which give even higher rewards. These could be better options because they push the cart further without losing balance too much.

On the other hand, having a high pole angular velocity (params[5]) might make things harder if it's unmanageably large, but these examples don't show that happening in the best cases. So maybe just having more negative values is safer.

I need to ensure I'm not repeating parameters from previous iterations and that each step contributes positively to the reward. It seems like using a mix of positive and slightly negative values across all relevant parameters can help achieve higher rewards consistently.

In summary, choosing parameters around [-6; -2.4; 0.8; etc.] might be effective because they balance stability with manageable movement. This setup should give a good reward without causing the cart to fall out of bounds or have an unstable pole.
