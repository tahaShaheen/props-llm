SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to find the optimal parameters for this cartpole environment. The goal is to balance the pole without letting it fall or make the cart go too far. The policy we're using is a linear one with 18 parameters arranged in a matrix W and bias B.

First, I remember that the reward function gives positive points every time the pole stays upright and the cart stays within bounds. So, our goal is to maximize the sum of these rewards over time steps.

Looking at the params provided earlier, they're all between -6 and 6 with one decimal place. The goal was around 500, which suggests that higher values are better for f(params). 

I need to adjust the parameters in such a way that each action (left or right) gives positive rewards when beneficial. If I set params[0] high enough, that would push me towards pushing left, but maybe too much could make it move too far. Similarly, params[1], which is the cart's velocity, should be positive because more movement in the cart can help balance.

I also notice that parameters 2 and 3 are for pole angle and angular velocity. A negative value would penalize a wider angle or faster angular velocity, which isn't good because we want the pole upright. So, params[2] and [3] should be as low (negative) as possible to encourage keeping the pole upright.

Looking at the recent examples where f(params) was high, like 437.80 and 420.05, it seems that having certain ranges for params is better. I think the current iteration has params[0] set higher than -3.5, which might be too much. Maybe pushing params[0] lower could help balance.

I also see some negative values in recent iterations, like params[6] being 4.5 or -3.5 depending on the example. That suggests that keeping the pole upright is crucial and requires balancing between too much left push (which might make it go out of bounds) and not pushing enough to tip the pole.

So, I should adjust params[0], [1], [2], and [3] carefully. Maybe set params[0] lower than -3.5 but still within the -6 limit to avoid making the cart too far. Parameters 4,5 could be adjusted based on whether pushing right would help balance more.

I'm a bit confused about how the reward is calculated in the environment, so maybe I should look at that as well. The reward depends on both pole uprightness and cart position within bounds. So, each action's choice must consider both aspects to maximize the sum over time.

Overall, my plan is to lower params[0] a bit, increase params[1], keep params[2] and [3] low (but not too negative), and perhaps adjust others based on what the episodes show. This should help in balancing the pole while keeping the cart within safe limits.
