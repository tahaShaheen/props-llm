SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 155 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to help someone find the global optimal policy for the cartpole environment using a linear policy. The current parameters are giving around 500 reward over 400 steps, but they want to push it higher.

First, I'll look at the existing parameters and their rewards. There's a best performing set with a reward of 402.20. But the user wants more than that. They provided three recent sets: two have around 300s and one has about 128. That doesn't seem right; maybe there was an error in the data.

I notice all parameters are within [-6,6] with one decimal place. Since the global optimum is around 500, they should aim higher than that. They mentioned using negative values for some parameters because positive ones might not be effective as seen in their examples. So I'll suggest tweaking parameters like [2:1.5], [3:-1], etc., to balance exploration and exploitation.

They didn't mention any specific policy steps beyond 400, so the model likely isn't getting better than that with enough data. They might need more iterations or a different search strategy. It's also possible they're missing some relevant examples from their environment setup.

I should make sure my response is straightforward, pointing out where the parameters are and what to adjust next without adding extra text. The goal is clear: increase positive parameters (push left) and decrease negative ones (push right), especially those that didn't perform well in their previous attempts.
