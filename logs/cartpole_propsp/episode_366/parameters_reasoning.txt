SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.
--- TOP 3 BEST PERFORMING PARAMS ---
params[0]: 6; params[1]: 6; params[2]: -3; params[3]: 6; params[4]: -6; params[5]: 1.8; params[6]: -3.5; params[7]: 4.5; params[8]: -2.5; params[9]: -2.5; f(params): 500.00

params[0]: -6; params[1]: -4.5; params[2]: 3; params[3]: 6; params[4]: -6; params[5]: 1.8; params[6]: -3.5; params[7]: 4.5; params[8]: -2.5; params[9]: -2.5; f(params): 500.00

params[0]: 7; params[1]: 6; params[2]: -3.5; params[3]: 7; params[4]: -6; params[5]: 1.8; params[6]: -3.5; params[7]: 4.5; params[8]: -2.5; params[9]: -2.5; f(params): 500.00

Now you are at iteration 366 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help this user find the optimal parameters for their cartpole environment using a policy optimizer. They've set up the problem with a linear policy where the action is determined by multiplying the state vector with W and adding B. The reward is +1 each time the pole stays upright and the cart stays within bounds.

They mentioned that the global optimum should be around 500, which means they want a high reward without causing any issues like pole tilting or cart going out of bounds. They also provided some examples of parameter values and their corresponding rewards, all showing a reward of 500.00 except for three more recent entries that also gave the same reward.

So, I need to come up with new parameters based on these examples. Let me look at the best-performing params first:

1. The first example has W as:
   [[6, 6],
    [-3, 6],
    [-6, -3],
    [6, -6]]

   And B is [-2.5, -2.5]. They got a reward of 500.

2. Another example with W:
   [[-6, -4.5],
    [3, 6],
    [-3.5, 4.5],
    [4.5, -2.5]]

   Same B values give the same reward.

And their recent examples also have a reward of 500, but slightly different W and B:

3. [[6, 6], [-3, -3.5], [6, 4.5], [-2.5, -2.5]] gives 500
   Wait, no, the user provided that as another recent example.

Wait, looking back: The most recent three params are:

- [[6,6,-3,6],[-6,1.8,3,6],... wait, no, each is a vector. Wait, no—the W matrix in the first param is 4x2, B is [8 parameters? No, for state of length 4: W has size 4x2 and B has size 2.

Wait, the user provided several examples where params are five numbers (W matrix has 8 elements since it's 4x2) plus the B vector which is two elements. So each example uses a combination of these to set up the policy.

The goal is to find W and B that maximize f(params), which is the episodic reward function.

Looking at the examples given, several have:

W = [[6,6], [-3,6], [-6,-3], [6,-6]]

B = [-2.5, -2.5]

But in another example, W is different but B remains the same. Wait no—the user's first example says W has [[6,6],[-3,6],[-6,-3],[6,-6]] and B is [-2.5,-2.5]. The second example also has similar W? Or did I misread?

Wait, the user provided:

1. params[0]: 6; 1:6; 2:-3; 3:6; 4:-6; 5:1.8; 6:-3.5; 7:4.5; 8:-2.5; 9:-2.5; f=500.

2. Then another params[0]: -6; 1:-4.5; 2:3; 3:6; etc., same reward.

Then three more recent params, with W values like [6,6,-3,7], [-6,1.8,3,6], which give f=500 as well.

So the best performers have W matrices that are a mix of positive and negative numbers, but they seem to balance each other so that when multiplied by the state vector, the reward is maximized.

The B values are around -2.5 or lower in some cases.

To find a better parameter set, I need to tweak these values slightly without causing any issues. Let me think about how the W and B should be arranged.

In the first example, W's last two rows have 6,-6 and similar patterns. So maybe trying to average the positive and negative numbers could help balance them out in future iterations.

Also, perhaps increasing some of the elements in W slightly might lead to a higher reward without causing issues.

For B, if current B is too low (like -2.5), maybe making it slightly higher would compensate for other parts of the reward function.

I think I'll try setting params[0] and [1] to 6 again since that's common in best performers, but maybe adjusting some of the middle elements a bit. Also, keeping B around -3 or similar could help balance the reward without letting any pole fall over or cart go out of bounds.
