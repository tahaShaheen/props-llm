SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

Now you are at iteration 4 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user provided some examples of params and their corresponding rewards. The goal is to find the optimal policy with a high episodic reward, ideally around 500. Looking at the examples, there are a couple of params that achieved 500.00. For instance, the first example has params where params[8] is 3.3 and params[9] is 4.2, and another where params[8] is 4.3 and params[9] is 4.2. Both of these achieved 500.00.

Now, the user is at iteration 4 and needs to propose new params. The key here is to explore around the current high-performing params without repeating them. Since the user mentioned that if we're below 500, we should explore instead of exploit, but in this case, the examples already have 500. So maybe we can tweak some parameters slightly to see if we can get even better performance or confirm that 500 is the max.

Looking at the first example with 500.00, the params are:

params[0]: 3.2, params[1]: 4.3, params[2]: 1.3, params[3]: 4.6, params[4]: -2.4, params[5]: 1.9, params[6]: -4.9, params[7]: -0.1, params[8]: 3.3, params[9]: 4.2.

Another example with the same reward has params[8] as 4.3 and params[9] as 4.2. So maybe adjusting params[8] and params[9] could be a way to explore. However, the user said not to propose previously seen params. So I need to change some other parameters instead.

Looking at the other parameters, maybe adjusting params[0] or params[1], which are 3.2 and 4.3. If I increase params[0] to 4.2 (as in one of the examples that had lower reward) but that resulted in lower reward. Alternatively, maybe decreasing params[0] to 2.2, but that also had lower reward. Hmm.

Wait, the user mentioned that during exploration, use a search step size of 1.0. So maybe take one of the high-performing params and adjust one parameter by +/-1.0. Let's take the first 500 example and adjust one parameter. Let's pick params[6], which is -4.9. Adding 1.0 would make it -3.9. Let's see if that's a new param. Also, check if other parameters are adjusted. But need to make sure not to repeat any previous params.

Alternatively, maybe change params[7], which is -0.1. Changing it to 0.9 (adding 1.0) might be a way. Let me check if that's a new combination. Also, need to ensure that all parameters are within [-6.0, 6.0], which they would be.

Another approach is to look for parameters that are close to the current ones but not exactly the same. For example, in the first 500 example, params[4] is -2.4. Maybe changing that to -1.4 (adding 1.0). But need to ensure that this hasn't been tried before. Looking at the examples, there's a param with params[4] as -2.4, but others have different values. So maybe that's a valid change.

Alternatively, looking at params[2] which is 1.3. Adding 1.0 would make it 2.3. Let me check if that's in any previous examples. The third example had params[2] as 2.3, but that had a lower reward. However, maybe combining that with other changes could lead to better results.

But since the user wants exploration, perhaps making a single parameter change of +1.0 or -1.0 from the current high-performing params. Let's pick params[8] which is 3.3 in one example and 4.3 in another. Let's take the first example (params[8] 3.3) and increase it by 1.0 to 4.3 (which was already tried but maybe with different parameters). Wait, but in the second example, params[8] is 4.3 and params[9] is 4.2, which gave 500.00. So maybe that's already a valid param. But the user says not to repeat previous params. So perhaps changing another parameter.

Alternatively, take the first example and change params[9] from 4.2 to 5.2 (adding 1.0). But need to check if that's allowed. Since 5.2 is within [-6,6], yes. But I need to make sure that this combination hasn't been tried before. Looking at the examples, there's a param with params[9] as 6.0, but that had lower reward. So maybe that's a new param.

So, the new params could be:

params[0]: 3.2, params[1]: 4.3, params[2]: 1.3, params[3]: 4.6, params[4]: -2.4, params[5]: 1.9, params[6]: -4.9, params[7]: -0.1, params[8]: 3.3, params[9]: 5.2.

But need to check if this is a new param. The previous examples don't show this exact combination, so it's acceptable. Alternatively, changing params[7] from -0.1 to 0.9 (adding 1.0). Let's do that.

So, new params would be:

params[0]: 3.2, params[1]: 4.3, params[2]: 1.3, params[3]: 4.6, params[4]: -2.4, params[5]: 1.9, params[6]: -4.9, params[7]: 0.9, params[8]: 3.3, params[9]: 4.2.

But wait, in the second example, params[8] is 4.3 and params[9] is 4.2. But here, params[7] is changed from -0.1 to 0.9. That's a new combination, so it's acceptable. Let me check if this is a valid exploration step. Yes, since only params[7] is changed by +1.0 from the original. This should be a valid exploration step.

Alternatively, maybe changing params[6] from -4.9 to -3.9 (adding 1.0). That could be another option. Let's go with that.

So, new params would be:

params[0]: 3.2, params[1]: 4.3, params[2]: 1.3, params[3]: 4.6, params[4]: -2.4, params[5]: 1.9, params[6]: -3.9, params[7]: -0.1, params[8]: 3.3, params[9]: 4.2.

This way, only params[6] is adjusted by +1.0. Since this combination hasn't been tried before, it's a valid exploration step. This should help in checking if changing that parameter can lead to higher rewards or not.

Alternatively, maybe changing params[0] from 3.2 to 4.2 (adding 1.0). But in one of the examples, that led to lower reward. However, since we're exploring, it's worth trying again with other parameters possibly adjusted.

But given that the user wants exploration with step size 1.0, and the current high-performing params are around the ones with 500, it's better to make small changes to those. So, changing params[6] from -4.9 to -3.9 seems like a good candidate. Let's proceed with that.
