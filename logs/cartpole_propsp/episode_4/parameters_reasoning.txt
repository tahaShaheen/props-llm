SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of training examples with different params and their corresponding episodic rewards. The goal is to find the global optimal policy, which they mentioned should be around 500. But looking at the examples, the highest reward so far is 127.00 for the params where params[0] is -4.8, params[1] is 0.5, and others. Then there's another entry with params[0] as -5.8, but the reward dropped to 120.45. Then when params[2] was increased to 3.6, the reward went down to 99.95. So maybe there's a sweet spot around params[0] being -4.8 or -5.0?

Wait, but the user said the global optimum should be around 500. The current examples have rewards up to 127, which is much lower. So maybe the user is referring to the maximum possible reward, which in the CartPole environment is typically 200 (since the episode length is 200 steps). But the examples here have rewards like 127, which is less than 200. So perhaps the user is expecting even higher rewards.

Looking at the params that gave 127.00: params[0] is -4.8, params[1] is 0.5, params[2] is 2.6, params[3] is 2.6, params[4] is -2.6, params[5] is 1.6, params[6] is -2.3, params[7] is 3.6, params[8] is -1.3, params[9] is -1.1. Maybe tweaking these values could lead to higher rewards.

But the user's instruction says during exploration, use a search step size of 1.0. So perhaps we need to explore around the current best parameters. The previous best was -4.8 for params[0], but when they tried -5.8, the reward decreased. So maybe increasing params[0] from -4.8 to -3.8? Let's check the next example where params[0] is -3.8, but the reward was 124.00, which is lower than 127. So maybe the optimal is around -4.8.

Alternatively, maybe adjusting other parameters. For example, params[2] and params[3] are both 2.6. What if we increase them? But in the next example, when params[2] was increased to 3.6, the reward dropped. So maybe keeping them at 2.6 is better.

Looking at the bias terms, params[8] is -1.3 and params[9] is -1.1. Maybe adjusting those? But the user said to explore with step size 1.0. So perhaps trying to change some parameters by +/- 1.0 from the current best.

Wait, the user also mentioned that the global optimum should be around 500. That's confusing because in the standard CartPole environment, the maximum reward is 200 (since the episode ends after 200 steps). Unless this is a modified version with longer episodes. But the user's examples have rewards up to 127, so maybe the environment is different. However, the user's note says the global optimum should be around 500, so maybe the function f(params) here is scaled or there's a different setup. Regardless, the user's instruction is to aim for that.

But given the examples, the highest reward so far is 127. So to reach 500, there's a big jump. Maybe the user made a mistake, but I have to follow their instructions.

Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to the number of steps, not the reward. But the problem says f(params) is the episodic reward. So maybe the user is mistaken, but I need to proceed.

In any case, the task is to generate new params that haven't been used before, using a step size of 1.0 during exploration. The current best is the one with reward 127. Let's take that as a starting point.

The params for that are:
params[0]: -4.8
params[1]: 0.5
params[2]: 2.6
params[3]: 2.6
params[4]: -2.6
params[5]: 1.6
params[6]: -2.3
params[7]: 3.6
params[8]: -1.3
params[9]: -1.1

Now, to explore, we can adjust each parameter by +/-1.0. Let's try increasing params[0] from -4.8 to -3.8 (since -5.8 was worse). So changing params[0] to -3.8. But in the examples, that gave 124.00. Maybe that's not better. Alternatively, let's try changing other parameters.

Looking at params[6] which is -2.3. Maybe increasing it to -1.3 (adding 1.0). Or changing params[7] from 3.6 to 4.6. Let's try that.

Alternatively, looking at params[4] which is -2.6. Adding 1.0 would make it -1.6. Maybe that helps.

But since the user says to explore with step size 1.0, perhaps we should generate several variations by adjusting each parameter by +/-1.0 from the current best.

So, for example:

1. Change params[0] from -4.8 to -3.8 (already tried, gave 124)
2. Change params[0] to -5.8 (already tried, worse)
3. Change params[1] from 0.5 to 1.5 or -0.5
4. Change params[2] from 2.6 to 3.6 or 1.6
5. Similarly for others.

But we need to avoid previously seen params. The previous examples include some of these. For instance, when params[0] was -4.8, that was already tried. So maybe try changing params[1] from 0.5 to 1.5, keeping others the same.

So new params would be:

params[0]: -4.8
params[1]: 1.5
params[2]: 2.6
params[3]: 2.6
params[4]: -2.6
params[5]: 1.6
params[6]: -2.3
params[7]: 3.6
params[8]: -1.3
params[9]: -1.1

This hasn't been tried before. Let's propose this as a new candidate. Alternatively, maybe changing params[2] and params[3] to see if increasing them helps, but when they were increased to 3.6, the reward dropped. So maybe not.

Another option is to adjust the bias terms. For example, changing params[8] from -1.3 to -0.3 or -2.3.

Alternatively, changing params[4] from -2.6 to -1.6. Let's try that.

But the user says to explore with step size 1.0. So maybe pick one parameter to adjust. Let's pick params[1] and increase it by 1.0 to 1.5. That's a new parameter set not seen before. Let's go with that.
