SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to find the global optimal policy for the cartpole environment using this linear policy approach. The user has provided some parameters and their corresponding episodic rewards. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I understand that the goal is to maximize the episodic reward f(params) which is the cumulative reward over each episode. The state of the system includes the cart position, velocity, pole angle, and angular velocity. The policy is linear with 18 parameters: W (4x4 matrix) and B (a 4-dimensional vector). 

The current user has given me some examples where they've provided parameter values and their corresponding rewards. Each example shows how changing certain parameters affects the reward. My task is to iteratively adjust these parameters based on the observed rewards until I reach the global optimum, which seems to be around a reward of 500.

Looking at the data, when params[8] is set to -2.5 and others are in their default range ([-6.0, 6.0], with one decimal place), the reward f(params) drops significantly to 334.25. That's quite low, so it looks like these parameters aren't optimal. However, when I adjust params[8] upwards or other parameters up and down, the reward increases.

I notice that in some examples, when more parameters are adjusted (like a few of them being set to -2.4 or -3.5), the rewards go up significantly. For instance, when param[0] is set to 2.4, the reward jumps up to 272.15, which is much higher than before. This suggests that changing certain parameters can have a more substantial impact on the reward.

I also see that having params like [params[6]: -3.5], which increases the pole angle negatively, improves the reward. That makes sense because if the pole angle is too high (positive), it might be unstable, leading to a lower reward when the pole falls over. So increasing params[6] brings the pole down more towards 0 radians, improving the state.

On the other hand, having some negative parameters like -4.5 or -3.5 for cart velocity or angle also helps in stabilizing the system and maintaining balance. For example, increasing param[1] from -2.4 to -4.5 makes the pole more stable, which is good because a pole that falls can result in lower rewards.

I'm thinking about how to systematically explore these parameters. The exploration should focus on regions around the current values where small changes might significantly affect the reward. However, I don't want to just randomly try every possible combination since that's too time-consuming and not efficient.

Perhaps I can use a method like gradient ascent, but since the policy is linear, maybe adjusting each parameter independently based on how it affects the reward. That way, for each parameter, I can adjust it upwards if increasing it improves the reward, and downwards if decreasing it does better.

Another approach is to use an iterative optimization technique like simulated annealing or a genetic algorithm. These methods allow me to search the parameter space in a more organized way, balancing exploration and exploitation. I'll need to define a fitness function that evaluates how high f(params) is and then guide the search accordingly.

I should also consider the possibility of plateaus where changing parameters doesn't change the reward. In such cases, I might need to take smaller steps or adjust multiple parameters simultaneously. However, given the examples provided, it seems like the relationship between parameters and rewards is relatively straightforward, so single parameter adjustments might suffice.

Additionally, since the cartpole environment has a balance aspect (the pole can fall beyond ±0.418 radians), I should ensure that my parameter adjustments keep the system within reasonable bounds, preventing any instability issues that could lead to lower rewards.

I'm also considering how much to adjust each parameter in each iteration. Starting with larger steps and then reducing them as exploration is exhausted might help find the optimal point more efficiently before diving into smaller tweaks for precision.

Finally, I need to document my findings clearly, noting which parameters are most impactful and how adjusting them affects the reward. This will guide future iterations and ensure that I'm moving towards the global optimum effectively.
