SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to find the global optimal policy for this cartpole environment. The user mentioned that currently, the reward is around 406-410, but they're looking for a higher score of up to 500. They want me to focus on parameters between -6 and 6, with one decimal places.

The policy uses a linear function approximator with 18 parameters. The reward is +1 every time the pole stays upright and the cart is within bounds, ending at 0 if the episode ends. The user also emphasized not to explore too far beyond where they've seen better results, using step size 1 for exploration.

First, I'll need to set up an exploration strategy that focuses on the regions where higher rewards have been achieved in their recent examples. They provided several parameters with their corresponding f(params) scores. So, my goal is to sample more from the regions that gave them the highest rewards and less from others.

I should generate new parameter sets by selecting a few promising ones based on f(params). For instance, looking at their recent best example where f was 406.25, I can try parameters around that area. Maybe points slightly above and below to see if they improve or not. 

Then, I'll need to ensure that these new samples aren't too far from the previously explored ones, so the exploration doesn't get overwhelming. Since step size is fixed at 1, each sample should be within one decimal place, but maybe sometimes moving a few tenths further to explore more.

I can also consider using a multi-sampling approach where I collect samples from different regions and then select the best ones for testing. This way, if some regions are better, they'll get a chance to shine without overwhelming others with too many samples.

Additionally, after each new sample, I should evaluate how it affects the f(params). If one of them is significantly higher than the current best, I should keep sampling from that area more frequently in future iterations. This keeps the exploration focused and ensures no region gets neglected.

Finally, after several iterations, if the reward hasn't improved beyond a certain threshold (like 500), I'll stop here or continue with a balanced approach to ensure thoroughness without over-exploring.
