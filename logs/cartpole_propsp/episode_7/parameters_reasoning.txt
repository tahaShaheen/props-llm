SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

Now you are at iteration 7 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.


LLM:
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is working on optimizing a linear policy for the CartPole environment. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward, which they mentioned should be around 500. The current examples show some params with rewards as high as 149.05, but that's still way below the target. 

Looking at the examples, there's a pattern in the params that seem to perform better. For instance, the params with -4.8, 0.5, 2.6, 2.6, -2.6, 1.6, -3.3, 3.6, -1.3, -1.1 had a reward of 149.05. That's one of the highest so far. Maybe tweaking some of these parameters could lead to higher rewards.

The user mentioned that during exploration, a step size of 1.0 should be used. So, perhaps adjusting some of the parameters that are close to the ones in the high-performing example. For example, the params[6] in that example is -3.3. If I increase that by 1.0 to -2.3, maybe that helps. Similarly, params[4] is -2.6; maybe changing that to -1.6 or -3.6. But I need to be careful not to repeat previous params.

Also, the user emphasized not proposing previously seen params. So, I need to look at the examples and ensure that the new params aren't duplicates. The last example had params[0] as -4.8, params[1] as 0.5, params[2] as 2.6, params[3] as 2.6, params[4] as -3.6, params[5] as 1.6, params[6] as -3.3, params[7] as 3.6, params[8] as -1.3, params[9] as -1.1. Maybe adjusting params[4] from -3.6 to -2.6 (which was in a previous example) might not be good. Alternatively, changing params[6] from -3.3 to -4.3 (a step of -1.0) could be a move in that direction.

Another thing to consider is the parameters that are in the W matrix. Each of the four state variables (cart position, velocity, pole angle, angular velocity) has two weights. Maybe increasing some of the weights for the pole angle or angular velocity could help in balancing the pole. For example, in the high-performing example, params[2] and params[3] (which are the weights for pole angle and angular velocity in the first row of W) are 2.6 and 2.6. Increasing those to 3.6 or 4.6 might help, but I need to check if that's within the range of [-6.0, 6.0].

Also, the bias terms (params[8] and params[9]) are -1.3 and -1.1. Maybe adjusting those slightly could influence the action selection. However, since the reward is high already, maybe small changes here could be beneficial.

But since the user wants exploration with a step size of 1.0, I should make a few parameters change by +/-1.0 from the current best. Let's take the last example with reward 149.05 and adjust some parameters. For example, changing params[4] from -3.6 to -2.6 (which was in a previous example, but maybe that's not good). Alternatively, changing params[6] from -3.3 to -4.3 (a step of -1.0). Also, maybe increasing params[7] from 3.6 to 4.6. Let me check if that's allowed (yes, since 4.6 is within -6 to 6). 

Another approach: looking at the parameters that might be underutilized. For example, in the W matrix, the second row (params[2] and params[3]) are 2.6 and 2.6. Maybe increasing those to 3.6 and 3.6. Similarly, the third row (params[4] and params[5]) are -3.6 and 1.6. Maybe adjusting those. 

But I need to ensure that the new params are not duplicates. Since the last example had params[0] as -4.8, maybe changing that to -5.8 (as in one of the earlier examples, but that had lower reward). Alternatively, trying to adjust params[1] from 0.5 to 1.5 (a step of +1.0). 

Putting this all together, perhaps the next step is to take the last high-performing params and adjust some of the parameters by +/-1.0. For example:

- params[0]: -4.8 (keep as is)
- params[1]: 0.5 + 1.0 = 1.5
- params[2]: 2.6 + 1.0 = 3.6
- params[3]: 2.6 + 1.0 = 3.6
- params[4]: -3.6 + 1.0 = -2.6
- params[5]: 1.6 + 1.0 = 2.6
- params[6]: -3.3 + 1.0 = -2.3
- params[7]: 3.6 + 1.0 = 4.6
- params[8]: -1.3 + 1.0 = -0.3
- params[9]: -1.1 + 1.0 = -0.1

This would be a new set of parameters, not seen before. Let me check if any of these are duplicates. The previous examples had similar values, but this combination might be new. 

Alternatively, maybe changing params[6] from -3.3 to -4.3 (a step of -1.0). Let's try that. So:

params[0]: -4.8
params[1]: 0.5
params[2]: 2.6
params[3]: 2.6
params[4]: -3.6
params[5]: 1.6
params[6]: -4.3
params[7]: 3.6
params[8]: -1.3
params[9]: -1.1

This is a different set from the previous examples. But I need to ensure that this is within the allowed range. All values are between -6.0 and 6.0. 

Another possibility is adjusting the bias terms. For example, increasing params[8] from -1.3 to -0.3 (a step of +1.0). That might help in shifting the decision boundary. 

So, combining these ideas, the new params could be:

params[0]: -4.8
params[1]: 0.5
params[2]: 3.6
params[3]: 3.6
params[4]: -2.6
params[5]: 2.6
params[6]: -4.3
params[7]: 4.6
params[8]: -0.3
params[9]: -0.1

This is a new set of parameters, and each change is a step of +/-1.0 from the previous high-performing example. This might lead to higher rewards. 

But I need to make sure that I'm not repeating any previous examples. Looking back, the example with params[0] as -4.8, params[1] as 1.5, etc., hasn't been seen before. So this should be a valid exploration step.
