SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has provided a bunch of training examples for the CartPole environment with different parameter values and their corresponding episodic rewards. The goal is to find the global optimal policy, which should be around 500. The current examples have rewards up to 247, which is way below the target. So, I need to figure out how to explore more effectively to reach that higher reward.

Looking at the existing params, most of them have params[0] around 4 or 5, and some other parameters like params[1] are -1.7 or -2.7. The rewards for these are in the 200s, but not close to 500. The user mentioned that during exploration, a search step size of 1.0 should be used. Also, the note says not to propose previously seen params, so I need to avoid those that are already listed.

First, I should consider varying the parameters that might be critical for balancing the pole. The state includes cart position, velocity, pole angle, and angular velocity. The policy is linear, so each state variable is multiplied by a weight and summed with the bias. The action is determined by which side has a higher value.

The current examples have params[0] (which is the weight for cart position in the first action) ranging from -1 to 5. Maybe trying higher values for some parameters could help. But since the global optimum is supposed to be around 500, perhaps the parameters need to be adjusted more significantly.

Wait, but the user said that during exploration, the step size is 1.0. So, if I take one of the existing parameters and adjust each parameter by +/-1.0, that might be a way to explore. For example, looking at the first example where params[0] is 4, maybe increasing it to 5 or 6 (but 6 is the upper bound). But in the existing examples, some have params[0] as 5, and the reward was 247.05. That's similar to the first example with params[0] as 4. So maybe that's not the right direction.

Alternatively, looking at other parameters. For instance, params[3] (which is the weight for cart velocity in the second action) in some examples is 3.1 or 4.2. Maybe trying to adjust that. But again, the rewards don't seem to increase much.

Another approach: the current examples have params[8] and params[9] (the bias terms) around 1.3 to 2.3. Maybe adjusting those could help. But without knowing which direction, it's tricky.

Wait, the user mentioned that the global optimum should be around 500. So maybe the current examples are in a local optimum around 247, and the user wants to escape that. To do that, exploration is needed. So, the next step is to take one of the existing params and change several parameters by +/-1.0 step. But which ones?

Looking at the first example: params[0] is 4, params[1] is -1.7, params[2] is -4, params[3] is 3.2, etc. Maybe increasing params[0] to 5, but that was already tried. Alternatively, changing params[2] from -4 to -5 or -3. Let's see. If I take the first example and change params[2] from -4 to -5, that's a step of -1.0. Then, check if that's a new parameter set.

Alternatively, looking at the second example where params[0] is 5, params[1] is -1.7, params[2] is -4, params[3] is 4.2. Maybe changing params[3] to 5.2 (adding 1.0). But that's already in the first example's params[7] as 5.2. Wait, no, that's params[7]. Maybe other parameters.

Alternatively, looking at params[6] and params[7], which are the weights for pole angular velocity. In some examples, they are -6 and 5.2, -5 and 6, etc. Maybe adjusting those. For example, increasing params[7] to 6.0 (but that's already in one of the examples). Or decreasing params[6] to -7 (but the range is [-6.0, 6.0], so can't go below -6.0).

Hmm. Since the user wants exploration with step size 1.0, maybe taking a param that's in the middle of the range and adjusting it. For example, in the first example, params[0] is 4. Maybe trying 3 or 5. But 5 was already tried. Trying 3, but that was in some examples. Let me check the existing params again.

Looking at the existing examples, the first one has params[0] as 4, and others have 5, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1. So maybe trying a new param that hasn't been tried yet. For instance, params[0] as 6.0 (max allowed). But the user said that the parameters are in the range [-6.0, 6.0] with one decimal place. So 6.0 is allowed.

But the user also said not to propose previously seen params. Let me check if any of the existing examples have params[0] as 6.0. Looking through the list, the first example's params[7] is 5.2, and another example has params[7] as 6.0. So, that's allowed. But maybe trying a new combination where some parameters are adjusted by 1.0 step from existing ones.

Alternatively, maybe looking for parameters that are not in the existing examples. For example, if I take a param from the first example and adjust one parameter by +1.0. Let's take the first example: params[0] is 4, params[1] is -1.7, params[2] is -4, params[3] is 3.2, etc. Let's adjust params[0] to 5.0 (already in the second example), so that's not new. Adjust params[1] from -1.7 to -0.7 (adding 1.0). Then, check if that's a new param set. Let's see: params[0] is 4, params[1] is -0.7, others as before. Is that in the existing examples? Looking through, there's an example with params[1] as -0.7, but others may differ. For example, in the 14th example, params[1] is -0.7, but other parameters are different. So maybe that's a new param set.

But the user wants to explore, so changing multiple parameters. For example, taking the first example and changing params[0] to 5, params[1] to -0.7, params[2] to -3, etc. But this might be too arbitrary.

Alternatively, since the current highest reward is 247, and the global optimum is 500, maybe the parameters need to be adjusted more significantly. Perhaps the existing examples are in a local optimum, and the next step is to move in a different direction.

Another approach: the policy is a linear function. For the CartPole problem, the optimal policy might involve making the cart move in the direction that counteracts the pole's tilt. For example, if the pole is leaning to the right, push the cart to the right to balance. So, the weights for the pole angle (params[2] and params[4]) might be positive for the right action and negative for the left action. Similarly, the cart velocity might have weights that dampen the velocity.

But without knowing the exact dynamics, it's hard to say. However, looking at the existing parameters, some have negative weights for the pole angle (params[2] is -4, which is for the first action's weight on pole angle). That might not be correct. Maybe the weights should be positive for the right action and negative for the left action when the pole is tilted.

Alternatively, maybe the current parameters are not capturing the correct relationship. For example, if the pole is leaning to the right (positive angle), the action should be to push the cart to the right, which would require that the right action's value is higher when the angle is positive. So, the weights for the pole angle in the right action (params[4] and params[ཛ]) should be positive. Looking at existing examples, in the first example, params[4] is 0.3 (positive), which is correct. params[2] is -4 (negative), which is for the left action's weight on pole angle. That would mean that when the pole is leaning right, the left action's value is lower, which is correct. So maybe that's correct.

But perhaps the weights need to be adjusted to be larger in magnitude. For example, making params[2] more negative, or params[4] more positive. However, the existing examples have params[2] as -4, -5, etc. So maybe increasing that to -6 (the lower bound) could help. Let's try that.

Take the first example: params[0] is 4, params[1] is -1.7, params[2] is -4, params[3] is 3.2, params[4] is 0.3, params[5] is -0.3, params[6] is -6, params[7] is 5.2, params[8] is 2.3, params[9] is 1.8. Now, if I change params[2] from -4 to -6 (a step of -2.0, but maybe that's too big. However, the user said to use a step size of 1.0. So, changing params[2] from -4 to -5 (step of -1.0). That's a valid move. Let's create a new param set with that change. So, params[2] is -5, others the same. Is that a new param set? Let me check existing examples. In the second example, params[2] is -4, so changing it to -5 would be a new set. That could be a candidate.

Alternatively, changing params[3] (which is the weight for cart velocity in the second action) from 3.2 to 4.2 (adding 1.0). But that was done in the second example, so that's already tried.

Alternatively, changing params[6] (pole angular velocity in the first action) from -6 to -5. But that's already in some examples.

Hmm. Maybe changing the bias terms (params[8] and params[9]). For example, in the first example, params[8] is 2.3 and params[9] is 1.8. Increasing params[8] to 3.3 (adding 1.0) and params[9] to 2.8. But that might be a new set. However, without knowing the impact, it's hard to say.

Another idea: look for parameters that have been changed in a way that could lead to higher rewards. For example, in the first example, params[7] is 5.2, which is the weight for pole angular velocity in the second action. If I increase that to 6.0 (max allowed), that's a step of +0.8, but the user said to use a step size of 1.0. So, maybe that's not allowed. Alternatively, changing it to 6.0 (if that's a step of +0.8, but perhaps the user allows that as a step towards exploration).

But the user's instruction is to use a step size of 1.0. So, any parameter should be adjusted by +/-1.0. So, for example, changing params[7] from 5.2 to 6.2 (but 6.2 is beyond the max of 6.0). So that's not allowed. So, the maximum is 6.0. So, changing from 5.2 to 6.0 is a step of +0.8, which is less than 1.0. Maybe that's acceptable as part of exploration.

But this is getting complicated. Let me think of a simple way to generate a new parameter set by changing one parameter by +1.0 or -1.0 from an existing example. For instance, take the first example and change params[0] from 4 to 5 (already done), or change params[1] from -1.7 to -0.7 (adding 1.0). That would be a new parameter set. Let's try that.

So, new params:

params[0] = 4 (unchanged)
params[1] = -0.7 (from -1.7 +1.0)
params[2] = -4 (unchanged)
params[3] = 3.2 (unchanged)
params[4] = 0.3 (unchanged)
params[5] = -0.3 (unchanged)
params[6] = -6 (unchanged)
params[7] = 5.2 (unchanged)
params[8] = 2.3 (unchanged)
params[9] = 1.8 (unchanged)

This would be a new parameter set not in the existing examples. But is that a good move? Maybe, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, changing multiple parameters. For example, take the first example and change params[0] to 5, params[1] to -0.7, params[2] to -5, etc. But this is getting too arbitrary.

Alternatively, looking for parameters that are in the middle of the range. For example, params[1] in the first example is -1.7. If I change that to -0.7 (adding 1.0), as before. Or to -2.7 (subtracting 1.0). But the user said to explore, so both directions are possible.

But since the current reward is low, maybe trying to increase some parameters that might contribute to higher rewards. For example, if the weights for the pole angle are too low, increasing them could help. Let's say in the first example, params[2] is -4. If we change that to -5 (subtracting 1.0), that might be a step towards a better reward.

So, the new params would be:

params[0] = 4
params[1] = -1.7
params[2] = -5
params[3] = 3.2
params[4] = 0.3
params[5] = -0.3
params[6] = -6
params[7] = 5.2
params[8] = 2.3
params[9] = 1.8

This is a new param set not in the existing examples. Let's check if this is valid. Yes, since params[2] was -4 before, now -5. That's a new set.

Alternatively, changing params[3] from 3.2 to 4.2 (adding 1.0), but that's already in the second example. So that's not new.

Another idea: check if any of the existing examples have a parameter that's not at the extremes. For example, in the first example, params[8] is 2.3. If I change that to 3.3 (adding 1.0), that's a new parameter. But again, not sure if that helps.

Considering all this, maybe the best approach is to take one of the existing examples and adjust one parameter by +1.0 or -1.0 to create a new parameter set. For example, the first example has params[0] = 4. Let's adjust that to 5 (already done), but another parameter. Let's take params[3] = 3.2 and change it to 4.2 (already in the second example). Not helpful. How about changing params[6] from -6 to -5 (adding 1.0). That would be a new parameter set. Let's check:

params[0] = 4
params[1] = -1.7
params[2] = -4
params[3] = 3.2
params[4] = 0.3
params[5] = -0.3
params[6] = -5
params[7] = 5.2
params[8] = 2.3
params[9] = 1.8

This is a new set. Is that a valid move? Yes. So, this could be a candidate. But how does that affect the policy? The weight for pole angular velocity in the first action (params[6]) is now -5 instead of -6. Maybe that's a better value.

Alternatively, changing params[7] from 5.2 to 6.2 (but that's beyond the max of 6.0). So, 6.0 is the max. So, changing to 6.0. That's a step of +0.8, but maybe acceptable.

But the user said to use a step size of 1.0, so maybe that's not allowed. So, perhaps changing params[7] from 5.2 to 6.2 is not allowed. So, the next step would be to change it to 6.0, which is within the range. That's a step of +0.8, which is less than 1.0, but maybe it's still considered as part of exploration.

In any case, after considering all these possibilities, I think the best approach is to take an existing parameter set and adjust one parameter by +1.0 or -1.0 to create a new set. For example, changing params[2] from -4 to -5 in the first example. That would be a new parameter set, and it's a valid move. So, the final answer would be that parameter set.
</think>

To generate a new parameter set by exploring within the bounds of a step size of 1.0 from an existing example, we take the first example:

**Existing Example:**
- `params[0] = 4`
- `params[1] = -1.7`
- `params[2] = -4`
- `params[3] = 3.2`
- `params[4] = 0.3`
- `params[5] = -0.3`
- `params[6] = -6`
- `params[7] = 5.2`
- `params[8] = 2.3`
- `params[9] = 1.8`

We choose to **adjust `params[2]`** (which is the weight for the pole angle in the first action) by **-1.0** (i.e., from `-4` to `-5`), keeping all other parameters unchanged. This results in a **new parameter set** that has not been explicitly listed in the original examples and is within the bounds of exploration.

### ✅ Final Answer:

**New parameter set:**
- `params[0] = 4`
- `params[1] = -1.7`
- `params[2] = -5`
- `params[3] = 3.2`
- `params[4] = 0.3`
- `params[5] = -0.3`
- `params[6] = -6`
- `params[7] = 5.2`
- `params[8] = 2.3`
- `params[9] = 1.8`
