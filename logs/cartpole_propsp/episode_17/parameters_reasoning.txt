SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has provided a bunch of training examples where the params are varied, and the function value f(params) is around 500.00 for many of them. But the goal is to find the global optimum which should be around 500. However, the user mentioned that if we're below that, we should explore instead of exploit. Wait, but in the examples given, many of them already hit 500.00. Maybe there's a plateau here, and the actual maximum is higher?

Wait, the user said the global optimum should be around 500. But looking at the examples, several params configurations already achieve 500.00. However, maybe there are some parameters that can push it higher. But according to the examples, even when changing some parameters, like params[8] from 3.3 to 4.3, the reward remains 500.00. That suggests that maybe the maximum is indeed 500, and those examples are already at the optimal. But the user says the global optimum should be around 500, so maybe there's a higher value possible?

Wait, the initial examples all have f(params) as 500.00, but the user says that the global optimum should be around 500. So perhaps the maximum is 500, and the examples are already at the optimal. However, the user might be indicating that the actual maximum is higher, but the examples are not reaching it. But in the examples, even when changing some parameters, the reward remains 500.00. So maybe the maximum is indeed 500, and the user's statement is a bit confusing.

But the user's instruction says that if we are below 500, we should explore. However, in the given examples, the f(params) is already 500.00. So maybe we are already at the maximum, but the user wants to confirm that. However, the user might have a different scenario in mind. Alternatively, perhaps the examples are not all at the maximum, but some of them have lower rewards, like 491.10, 451.60, etc. So the ones with 500.00 are on a plateau, and there might be higher values.

But according to the user's note, the global optimum should be around 500. So perhaps the examples are already at the optimal, and the user wants to confirm that. However, the user might be expecting that the maximum is higher than 500. Maybe the examples are just showing that some parameters reach 500, but there's a way to get higher.

Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake, and the actual maximum is 500. But given that the examples have some with 500.00, perhaps that's the maximum. However, the user's instruction says that if you're below 500, explore. So in this case, since the examples are at 500, maybe we should not explore anymore. But the user also says that during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So perhaps the current examples are on a plateau, and we need to explore further.

Wait, the user's instruction says that if you are below 500, you should explore. But in the examples, some are at 500, others are below. So maybe the current iteration is at 17, and we need to continue exploring. But the user says that the global optimum is around 500, so maybe the maximum is 500, and the examples are already there. However, the user might be expecting that we can get higher than 500. But according to the examples, even when changing parameters, the reward remains 500.00. So perhaps that's the maximum.

But the user's instruction says that during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So maybe the current parameters are in a region where small changes don't affect the reward, but larger steps could find better values. However, the examples show that even when changing some parameters, the reward remains 500.00. So maybe the optimal is indeed 500, and the user is just testing whether we can stay at that level.

Alternatively, perhaps the user's examples are not exhaustive, and there's a way to get higher. But given the information, the best approach is to look for parameters that might slightly increase the reward. However, since the examples already have some parameters that hit 500.00, and the user says that the global optimum is around 500, maybe we should stay in that region.

But the user's instruction says that if you are below 500, you should explore. Since in the examples, some are at 500, others are lower. So perhaps the current parameters are on the edge of the plateau, and we need to explore further. However, the user's instruction says that during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So perhaps we should adjust some parameters by 1.0 to see if we can get higher.

Looking at the examples, the first few have params[8] as 3.3, then in one example it's 4.3, and the reward is 491.10, which is lower. So maybe increasing params[8] beyond 3.3 reduces the reward. Similarly, when params[9] is increased to 5.2, the reward drops to 345.05. So perhaps adjusting other parameters could help.

Looking at the parameters, maybe adjusting the bias terms (params[8] and params[9]) could influence the action selection. However, in the examples, when params[8] was 3.3, the reward was 500.00, but when increased to 4.3, it dropped. So maybe the optimal values for the bias are around 3.3 and 4.2. But how to find that?

Alternatively, looking at the weights. For example, params[0] is 3.2 in most examples. If we try increasing it by 1.0 to 4.2, but in one example, that resulted in a lower reward (491.10). So perhaps that's not the way. But maybe adjusting other parameters.

Alternatively, looking at params[4] which is -2.4 in many examples. If we adjust that to -3.4, in one example, the reward was 500.00. So maybe that's still on the plateau. But changing it to -1.4 resulted in a lower reward.

Hmm. It's challenging. Since the examples are already achieving 500.00, and the user says that the global optimum is around 500, maybe the current parameters are already optimal. However, the user's instruction says that if you are below 500, explore. Since in the examples, some are at 500, but others are lower, perhaps the current iteration is in a region where further exploration is needed.

But given that the user has provided 17 iterations, and the maximum steps are 400, perhaps the next step is to explore by changing some parameters by 1.0. For example, let's take one of the parameters that was in the examples, like params[6] which was -4.9. If we change that to -5.9 (step size 1.0), but in an example, that resulted in 500.00. So maybe that's still on the plateau.

Alternatively, looking at params[7], which was -0.1 in many examples. Changing it to 0.9 or -1.1 didn't affect the reward. So perhaps that's not the way.

Alternatively, looking at params[2], which was 1.3. If we change it to 2.3 or 0.3, the reward was still 500.00. So maybe that's part of the plateau.

Hmm. Maybe the parameters are in a region where multiple combinations give the same reward. So the optimal is indeed 500, and the user's note about the global optimum being around 500 is correct. Therefore, the current examples are already at the maximum. However, the user might want to confirm that by checking if there are any other parameters that can reach higher.

But given the information, the best approach is to stay within the parameters that achieved 500.00. For example, take one of the existing examples and slightly perturb it. But the user said not to propose previously seen params. So need to generate new ones.

Wait, the user's instruction says: "Do not propose previously seen params." So even if the previous examples have 500.00, we need to generate new parameters that haven't been used before. So perhaps changing one of the parameters by 1.0 step. For example, take the first example and change params[0] from 3.2 to 4.2 (since that's a step of +1.0). But in one of the examples, changing params[0] to 4.2 resulted in 491.10. So that's lower. So maybe that's not the way.

Alternatively, take params[6] which was -4.9. Change it to -3.9 (step of +1.0). But in one example, that was done and the reward was 500.00. So that's already in the examples. So we can't use that.

Alternatively, change params[7] from -0.1 to 0.9 (step of +1.0). But that was already done in an example and the reward was 500.00. So again, that's already used.

Hmm. So maybe the next step is to try changing another parameter that hasn't been modified in the examples. For example, params[5] is 1.9 in many examples. If we change that to 2.9 (step +1.0), but in one example, params[5] was 2.9 and the reward was 500.00. So that's already used.

Alternatively, params[3] was 4.6. Changing that to 5.6 (step +1.0) was done in an example, and the reward was 500.00. So that's already used.

What about params[4] which was -2.4. Changing that to -1.4 (step +1.0) resulted in a lower reward. So not helpful.

Alternatively, changing params[8] from 3.3 to 2.3 (step -1.0). But in one example, that was done and the reward was 500.00. So that's already used.

Hmm. It seems that all the parameters that can be changed by 1.0 step have been tried in the examples, and they either result in the same reward or lower. Therefore, the current parameters are already on the plateau of 500.00, and further exploration might not yield higher rewards. However, the user's instruction says that the global optimum should be around 500, which suggests that 500 is the maximum. Therefore, the current parameters are already optimal, and no further exploration is needed. But the user's instruction says that if you are below 500, explore. Since the current examples are at 500, perhaps we should stop. However, the user hasn't confirmed that yet, so we need to proceed.

But the user hasn't provided the function's value for the next step. The current iteration is 17, and we need to provide a new set of parameters. Since all the possible 1.0 step changes have been tried in the examples and resulted in 500.00 or lower, perhaps the next step is to try a different approach. Maybe changing multiple parameters at once, but with step size 1.0. However, the user's instruction says during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So maybe adjusting two parameters by 1.0.

For example, take the first example and increase params[0] by 1.0 (from 3.2 to 4.2) and decrease params[1] by 1.0 (from 4.3 to 3.3). That would be a new set of parameters not seen before. But I need to check if that's allowed. However, the user hasn't specified whether multiple parameters can be adjusted. The instruction says during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So perhaps adjusting one parameter by 1.0. But since all single parameter changes have been tried, maybe we need to try a different combination.

Alternatively, maybe there are parameters not modified in the examples. For example, in the first example, params[6] is -4.9. What if we change that to -5.9 (step -1.0)? But that was already done in an example and resulted in 500.00. So that's already used.

Alternatively, changing params[7] from -0.1 to -1.1 (step -1.0). But that was done in an example and resulted in 500.00.

Hmm. It seems that all possible 1.0 step changes have been tried, and the reward remains 500.00. Therefore, the current parameters are already optimal, and further exploration is not needed. But the user's instruction says that if you are below 500, explore. Since the current examples are at 500, perhaps we should stop. However, the user hasn't confirmed that yet, so we need to proceed.

Given that, perhaps the next step is to slightly perturb one of the parameters that are on the edge of the plateau. For example, take params[8] which was 3.3. Increase it to 4.3 (but that was done and resulted in 491.10). Not helpful. Decrease to 2.3 (already done and resulted in 500.00). So maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, take params[9] which was 4.2. Increase it to 5.2 (already done, resulted in lower reward). Decrease to 3.2 (not sure if that was done). Let me check the examples. In one example, params[9] was 3.2 and the reward was 500.00. So that's possible. So changing params[9] from 4.2 to 3.2 (step -1.0) would be a new parameter not seen before. But in the examples, there was a case where params[9] was 3.2 and the reward was 500.00. Wait, in one example, params[8] was 2.3 and params[9] was 3.2, and the reward was 500.00. So that's already used.

Hmm. This is tricky. Maybe the best approach is to take one of the parameters that are on the edge of the plateau and adjust them slightly. For example, take params[6] which was -4.9. Change it to -4.0 (step +0.9), but that's not a 1.0 step. The user's instruction says during exploration, use a step size of 1.0. So that's not allowed.

Alternatively, take params[7] from -0.1 to 0.9 (already done). Or to -1.1 (already done). So no new options there.

At this point, it seems that all possible 1.0 step changes have been tried in the examples, and the reward remains 500.00. Therefore, the current parameters are already optimal, and no further exploration is needed. However, the user might expect that there's a higher value, but given the examples, it's not possible. So the best course of action is to propose a new set of parameters that haven't been tried before, but with small changes. However, the user's instruction says to use a step size of 1.0 during exploration, so perhaps even if it's not the best, we need to follow that.

Alternatively, since all the 1.0 step changes have been tried, perhaps the next step is to try a different approach, like adjusting multiple parameters by 0.5 steps. But the user's instruction says to use a step size of 1.0 during exploration. So that's not allowed.

Given the constraints, the best option is to propose a new set of parameters that hasn't been used before, even if it's a small change. For example, take one of the parameters that were in the examples and adjust them slightly. But the user said not to propose previously seen params. So perhaps take the first example and adjust one parameter by 1.0, but that was already done. For example, changing params[0] from 3.2 to 4.2 was done and resulted in lower reward. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, take a parameter that was not changed in the examples. For example, in the first example, params[0] is 3.2. What if we change it to 2.2 (step -1.0)? That's a new parameter not seen before. Let's check if that's possible. In the examples, there's no case where params[0] was 2.2. So that's a new parameter. So the new params would be:

params[0]: 2.2; params[1]: 4.3; params[2]: 1.3; params[3]: 4.6; params[4]: -2.4; params[5]: 1.9; params[6]: -4.9; params[7]: -0.1; params[8]: 3.3; params[9]: 4.2.

This is a new set of parameters not seen before. Even though it's a step of -1.0 from the original, it's a new configuration. So that's a valid proposal.
