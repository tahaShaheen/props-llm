SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

Now you are at iteration 17 out of 400. Provide the results in ONLY the indicated format 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]'. Do not provide any additional texts. Otherwise your response will be useless.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to help this user find the optimal policy for the cartpole environment using reinforcement learning. Let's see what they've provided.

First, the user has run several trials with different parameters and I need to analyze the results. Each trial uses the same 400 steps but varies the params array. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward f(params).

Looking at the top performing params from their data:

1. [6.6; 1.4; -1.8; -0.2; 3.7; 1.1; -1; 1.5; -2.1; -2.2] gives a reward of 76.95.
2. [1.8; -4; 2.8; -1.6; 2.9; 1.2; -5.2; 4.1; -0.3; -0.9] with 61.
3. [4.5; -3.9; 2.8; 0.7; 3.6; 1.1; -1.5; 3.9; -0.7; 0.9] gives 54.10.

The most recent result is a set where f(params) is around 14, but that's probably an older trial or due to noise in the data.

I notice that params[0] varies quite a bit between trials, with some going as high as 6.6 and as low as -4.8. The reward seems to peak at higher values for certain combinations of these parameters. For example, having a high cart velocity (params[1]) might help the pole stay upright.

I should also consider that in exploration, using step size 1.0 means I'm changing each parameter individually without affecting others. This is helpful because it allows me to see how sensitive the reward is to changes in each parameter.

The user mentioned that they want to aim around 500 reward, which seems high. From their data, the best reward was 76.95, so maybe they need a higher value but are considering stopping or trying more steps. However, since they're at iteration 17 out of 400 and have already explored each parameter individually, I should focus on refining these parameters based on the current rewards.

I think the next step is to look for patterns in the top parameters that give high rewards. For example, when params[8] (B) was -2.1, it gave a reward of 54.10. Maybe having certain combinations of W and B can lead to better performance.

Also, considering the pole angle (params[2]) being around -0.418 is crucial; if that's too low, the pole might fall easily. So maybe there's an optimal value for params[2].

The cart velocity (params[1]) affects how quickly the cart moves. A higher velocity could help in moving the cart and balancing the pole more effectively.

I should also think about the reward structure: +1 for each time step the pole is upright and within bounds. So, achieving a stable balance is key.

Now, looking at the current params that give around 20 points, like [5.5; 5.5; 7.5; ...], maybe the optimal parameters are somewhere in this range with a focus on higher velocity and less negative angles for the pole.

I might also look into how W and B affect the policy. The policy is linear, so each parameter in W and B contributes to the action probability based on the state.

In conclusion, I need to propose new params that perhaps have lower cart velocity, higher pole angle, but not too high a cart position or push force. Also, considering more negative angles for the pole could help it stay upright longer.

I'll suggest trying parameters around -3.9 for params[1] and [2], maybe with a bit of variation in others to see how that affects the reward.
