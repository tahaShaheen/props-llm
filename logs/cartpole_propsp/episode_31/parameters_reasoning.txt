SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

USER:
Next, you will see examples of params and their episodic reward f(params).
You will see up to 15 top params and 5 most recent params.

LLM:
<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to help find the optimal policy for the cartpole environment using this linear policy optimizer. The user has provided some parameters and wants me to suggest new ones based on their performance.

First, looking at the current parameters: params[0] is 6.4, which seems high, but maybe that's too extreme. I remember from the examples that when a parameter was around 5 or higher, the score was lower. So maybe going down in those areas would help.

They went up to 5.5 and got a score of 54.10. Then they adjusted some parameters slightly: pushed left (params[2] = -3.9), increased right (params[1] = 1.4), decreased pole angle (-1.5), etc. That seems like it might be better.

Wait, the most recent example that gives a high score was params[0]:6.4 and [1]:7.5. Oh, no, actually in their recent attempt, they went to 5.5 which was good but maybe not as good as higher ones. Hmm, I think I should stick with similar or better values.

They tried 6.6 and got 99.00, which is the highest. So that's great. Maybe going slightly down from there? Let me check: params[1] was -2.1 and [-2.2]. Using 6.6 seems good but maybe lowering it a bit could lead to better exploration.

What about other parameters? For example, pushing left (params[2]=-3.9) might be too strong initially, so perhaps keeping it in the positive range but not that high. params[3] was -0.7 or 0.7; they used 0.7, which is better than -0.7.

Pole angular velocity (params[4]=2.9) seems a bit low if pushed right with 1.4. Maybe increasing it a bit? But then the cart might move too much, causing the pole to fall over. Not sure about that yet.

So putting this together: params[0] at 6.6 is good, but maybe decrease slightly. params[1]: since they were both high and got a decent score, perhaps lowering it a bit more. params[2]: not pushing too hard initially; params[3] could stay around -0.7 or increase a bit to see if the pole angle's velocity gets better. params[4] might adjust up a bit without causing overstepping.

Also, params[5], [6], and [7], maybe keep them as they are since the previous examples didn't show much change there. For params[8] and 9: -0.3 and -0.7 seem okay; if they went down too much, it might not help, but going up a bit could balance things out.

Wait, let me check the most recent high score example again: params[0]:6.4, [1]:7.5. That's higher than 6.6, so maybe that was better. But their score was slightly lower at 9.35 compared to 9.45. Hmm, not sure why. Maybe a different configuration there.

So overall, I think adjusting params[0], [1], and [2] could help. Let me try setting them around 6.6 for params[0], maybe -3.8 or similar for [1]. For [2], perhaps 1.4 instead of pushing left? Or not too much less.

Putting it all together, I'll suggest adjusting these parameters and keep others as they are to see how the score changes.
