SYSTEM:
You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
The state is a vector of 4 elements, representing the cart position (-4.8 to 4.8), cart velocity (-inf to inf), pole angle (-0.418 to 0.418 rad), and ple angular velocity (-inf to inf) respectively. The goal is to keep the pole upright and the cart within the bounding position of [-2.4, 2.4].
The action space consists of 2 actions (0: push left, 1: push right).
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax(state @ W + B), where
state = [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]
W = [[params[0], params[1]],
    [params[2], params[3]],
    [params[4], params[5]],
    [params[6], params[7]]]
B = [params[8], params[9]]
The reward is +1 for every time step the pole is upright and the cart is within the bounding position. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart goes out of bounds.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 10 float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy. 
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[9]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around 500.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of 1.0**.

LLM:
<think>
Okay, let's see. I need to find the optimal parameters for the cartpole environment. The user provided some examples of previous params and their rewards. The goal is to maximize the episodic reward, aiming for around 500. From the examples, the highest reward so far is 365.50. But that's still below 500, so I need to explore more.

Looking at the examples, some patterns emerge. The params with higher rewards have certain values. For instance, params[0] is often around 5 or 6, params[1] is sometimes 0.3 or -0.7. The W matrix entries (params 0-7) seem to have a mix of positive and negative values, and the bias terms (params 8-9) are also varying. 

But since the user mentioned that if I'm below 500, I should explore instead of exploit. The current highest is 365.50, so definitely need to explore. The exploration step size is 1.0, so I should make changes of 1.0 to the parameters. But I need to ensure that the new params are not previously seen.

Looking at the previous params, some entries are 5, 6, -4, -5, etc. Maybe trying to increase some parameters that are lower. For example, in the first example, params[0] is 5, maybe increasing to 6. But some of the examples already have 6. Alternatively, trying to adjust other parameters. 

Wait, the user said to search both positive and negative values. So maybe some parameters that were previously low could be increased, and others decreased. For example, looking at params[2], which in some examples is -4, -5, etc. Maybe trying to adjust that. Also, the bias terms (params 8 and 9) in the highest example are 6 and 6. Maybe increasing them further? But they are already at 6.0, which is the upper limit. So can't go higher. 

Hmm. So perhaps adjusting other parameters. Let's think about the structure of the policy. The action is the argmax of state @ W + B. So the weights W and bias B determine which action is chosen. To keep the pole upright, the policy needs to push the cart in the direction that stabilizes the pole. 

Maybe the weights for cart position and pole angle are important. For example, if the cart is moving too far left, the policy should push right. Similarly, if the pole is leaning left, push right. So the weights might need to be positive for certain terms. But this is just a hypothesis.

Alternatively, looking at the examples, some entries have high values in W and B. Maybe trying to tweak those. But since the current highest is 365.50, which is still low, perhaps trying to explore new areas. For example, changing params that haven't been explored much. 

Looking at the previous params, some entries have params[6] as -6, which is the lower limit. Maybe trying to increase that. But if it's already at -6, can't go lower. Wait, the parameters are in the range [-6.0, 6.0]. So maybe trying to set some parameters that are at the extremes. For example, if params[3] is 6.2 in some examples, but the max is 6.0. Wait, the user said that params are in the range [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place. So maybe some of the examples have values beyond that, but that's a mistake. Wait, in the first example, params[3] is 6.2, which is outside the allowed range. But the user said that params are in [-6.0, 6.0]. So perhaps that's a typo, and it should be 6.0. But regardless, the user is providing the examples, and I have to work with them.

But maybe the user made a mistake in the examples. However, I need to proceed with the given data. 

Assuming that the examples are correct, even if they have values beyond the range. But the user said that params are in [-6.0, 6.0]. So perhaps those examples have typos. But maybe the actual allowed range is up to 6.2? No, the user specified [-6.0, 6.0]. So perhaps the examples have errors. But regardless, I need to generate new params within the allowed range.

So, back to generating new params. Since the current highest is 365.50, and the goal is 500, I need to explore. Let's consider changing some parameters by +/-1.0. For example, take the first example with 365.50:

params[0]:5, params[1]:0.3, params[2]:-4, params[3]:6.2 (but this is over 6.0), params[4]:4.3, params[5]:1.7, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6.2, params[8]:6, params[9]:6.

But since the allowed range is up to 6.0, maybe those are typos. Let's assume they should be 6.0. So, for example, params[3] is 6.0, params[7] is 6.0. 

Now, to explore, perhaps adjust some of these parameters. For example, increasing params[0] from 5 to 6, which is allowed. Or decreasing params[2] from -4 to -5. But in some examples, params[2] is already -5. 

Alternatively, trying to change params that haven't been explored much. For example, looking at the previous examples, some have params[1] as -0.7, 1.3, etc. Maybe trying params[1] as 1.0 or -1.0. 

Another approach is to look for parameters that could be adjusted to increase the reward. For instance, if the bias terms (params 8 and 9) are set to 6, which is the maximum, maybe that's already optimal. But perhaps adjusting other parts of the weight matrix. 

Alternatively, looking at the W matrix. The state is [cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity]. The W matrix is 4x2. So for each state variable, there are two weights. The action is determined by which side has a higher value. So, for example, if the cart is moving left (negative velocity), the policy should push right. So the weights for cart_velocity might need to be positive for the right action. 

But this is getting too theoretical. Since I need to generate new params, perhaps take the highest example (params that gave 365.50) and adjust some parameters by +/-1.0. For example, changing params[0] from 5 to 6 (since that's allowed), or params[2] from -4 to -5. But in some examples, params[2] is already -5. 

Alternatively, changing params[3] from 6.2 (assuming it's a typo and should be 6.0) to 5.0. But that might not be helpful. 

Another thought: the user mentioned that the global optimum is around 500. So the current best is 365, which is quite far. So maybe the parameters need a more significant change. For example, trying to increase some parameters that are currently low. 

Looking at the examples, some parameters are at the extremes. For example, params[6] is -6, which is the lower limit. Maybe changing that to -5. But that might not help. 

Alternatively, looking at params[7] which in some examples is 6.2 (again, possibly a typo). If it's 6.0, then maybe increasing it further isn't possible. 

Hmm. This is tricky. Maybe trying to adjust multiple parameters. For example, taking the highest example (params that gave 365.50) and modifying a few parameters. Let's take that example:

params[0]:5, params[1]:0.3, params[2]:-4, params[3]:6.2 (assuming typo, 6.0), params[4]:렴, params[5]:1.7, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6.2 (again, typo), params[8]:6, params[9]:6.

If I adjust params[0] to 6, params[2] to -5, params[3] to 5.0, and params[7] to 5.0, that might be a new set of parameters. But I need to ensure they are within the allowed range. 

Alternatively, trying to increase params[4] from 4.3 to 5.3, but that's beyond 6.0. No, 4.3 to 5.3 is allowed. 

But this is just random guessing. Maybe a better approach is to look for parameters that could be adjusted to increase the reward. For example, if the current highest example has params[3] at 6.0, maybe increasing other parameters that are lower. 

Alternatively, considering that the action is the argmax, maybe ensuring that the weights for the correct actions are higher. For example, if the cart is moving left (negative velocity), the right action should be chosen. So the weight for cart_velocity in the right action should be positive. 

But without knowing the exact dynamics, it's hard to say. 

Given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to take the highest example and adjust one parameter by +/-1.0. For example, increasing params[0] from 5 to 6, which is allowed. Let's try that. So:

params[0]:6, params[1]:0.3, params[2]:-4, params[3]:6.0, params[4]:4.3, params[5]:1.7, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6.0, params[8]:6, params[9]:6.

This would be a new set of parameters. Since params[0] was previously 5, changing it to 6 is a new value. This might lead to a higher reward. Alternatively, changing params[2] from -4 to -5, but that's already in some examples. 

Another possibility is to adjust params[1] from 0.3 to 1.3, which is within the range. 

But I need to choose one set of parameters. Let's go with increasing params[0] to 6, and keeping the rest as in the highest example. That's a valid change and hasn't been tried yet in the examples provided. 

So the new params would be:

params[0]:6, params[1]:0.3, params[2]:-4, params[3]:6.0, params[4]:4.3, params[5]:1.7, params[6]:-6, params[7]:6.0, params[8]:6, params[9]:6.

This should be within the allowed range. Let's check each parameter:

- params[0] 6.0: allowed.
- params[1] 0.3: allowed.
- params[2] -4.0: allowed.
- params[3] 6.0: allowed.
- params[4] 4.3: allowed.
- params[5] 1.7: allowed.
- params[6] -6.0: allowed.
- params[7] 6.0: allowed.
- params[8] 6.0: allowed.
- params[9] 6.0: allowed.

Yes, all within range. This is a new combination not present in the previous examples. So this could be a candidate for exploration.
