You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
{% include env_description %}

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of {{ rank }} numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from {{ actions[0] }}.
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * Line 1: a new set of params 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[{{ rank - 1 }}]: ', aiming to maximize the policy's episodic reward. 
    Please propose params values from {{ actions[0] }}.
    * Line 2: detailed thoughts on the policy's performance, and your thoughts on the best strategy for the task, and your opinion on which action should be taken for each state. Think step by step and list out the details.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around {{ optimum }}.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.

Now you are at iteration {{step_number}} out of 400. Please provide the results in the indicated format. Do not provide any additional texts.
