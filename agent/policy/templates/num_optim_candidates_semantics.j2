You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
{% include env_description %}

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of {{ rank }} numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from {{ actions[0] }}.
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS (400) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
    * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[{{ rank - 1 }}]: W'
    Propose params values from {{ actions[0] }}. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around {{ optimum }}.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search all the possible values of params.

Next, you will see examples of params, there episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield.
You will see up to {{ buffer_top_k }} top params and {{ buffer_recent_j }} most recent params.
{{ episode_reward_buffer_string }}

Now you are at iteration {{step_number}} out of 400. OUTPUT ONLY THIS SINGLE LINE:
params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[{{ rank - 1 }}]: W
Do NOT output anything else. No explanation, no reasoning, nothing.
{% if attempt_idx > 0 %}
WARNING: Attempt {{attempt_idx + 1}}/10. FAILED {{attempt_idx}} times. {{10 - attempt_idx - 1}} remaining. OUTPUT MUST BE EXACTLY: params[0]: X, ..., params[{{ rank - 1 }}]: Z from {{ actions[0] }}
