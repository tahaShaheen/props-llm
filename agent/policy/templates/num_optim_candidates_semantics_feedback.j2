{{ episode_reward_buffer_string }}

Above are all previous params attempts from the buffer, showing their episodic reward f(params) and the trajectories they yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the agent falls into a hole or gets to the goal.

**IMPORTANT: Feedback from Human Observers**
Some params sets above have feedback from a human observer who watched the policy execute. This feedback is shown directly under the params:
- If marked with "FEEDBACK:", the human provided observations about the policy behavior
- Use this feedback to inform your next choice of params
- If no feedback is listed, no human feedback was collected for that params set

You are good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
{% include env_description %}

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of {{ rank }} numbers.
**params** values should be chosen from {{ actions[0] }}.
The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS ({{ num_episodes }}) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[{{ rank - 1 }}]: W'
   Propose params values from {{ actions[0] }}. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over {{ num_evaluation_episodes }} episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. A human observer will watch the policy execute and may provide feedback on the behavior.
5. We will repeat steps 2-4 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around {{ optimum }}.**
3. Search all the possible values of params.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer above.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
   - If the rewards in the buffer are far below {{ optimum }}, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
   - If the rewards are close to {{ optimum }}, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.

# HUMAN FEEDBACK:
You may receive feedback from a human observer who watched the policy execute in the environment.
**Take this feedback seriously** - the human can see qualitative aspects of the behavior that the reward number alone cannot capture.
Use the feedback to guide your next parameter choice. For example:
- If the human says the agent is "getting stuck", try different action sequences.
- If the human says the agent is "heading towards the hole", adjust to avoid that direction.
- If the human says the policy is "close to the goal", make small refinements.

{% if last_policy_params %}
# LAST POLICY YOU PROPOSED:
{{ last_policy_params }}
{% endif %}

{% if human_feedback %}
# HUMAN FEEDBACK ON YOUR LAST POLICY:
A human observer watched your last policy execute and provided this feedback:
"{{ human_feedback }}"

**Consider this feedback carefully when proposing your next params.**
{% endif %}

Now you are at iteration {{step_number}} out of {{ num_episodes }}. 
CRITICAL: (1) Provide an explanation or reasoning for your choice of params. (2) Then output the proposed params in the following exact format: params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[{{ rank - 1 }}]: W

{% if attempt_idx > 0 %}
WARNING: Attempt {{attempt_idx + 1}}/10. FAILED {{attempt_idx}} times. {{10 - attempt_idx - 1}} remaining. OUTPUT MUST BE EXACTLY: params[0]: X, ..., params[{{ rank - 1 }}]: Z from {{ actions[0] }}
{% endif %}
