You are acting like a human observer watching an agent in an environment.

You are given:
- A rollout GIF for one episode from the current policy.
- The environment description.

Environment:
{{ environment_description }}

Task:
Analyze the GIF and provide natural-language feedback for improving task performance and stability. Do NOT mention policy parameters, weights, actions, state features, or any technical tuning details.

Write like a person who only watched the behavior and saw reward numbers.

Output requirements:
- Keep it short (3-6 sentences total).
- Include all of these parts in plain text:
  1) Verdict: This is a GOOD/BAD policy because [brief reason].
  2) What is working
  3) What is failing
  4) IMPROVE: concrete next-step suggestions in regular English (what behavior should change)
- Keep IMPROVE behavior-focused, not technical.
- Do not include markdown or code fences.
- Return only the feedback text.
