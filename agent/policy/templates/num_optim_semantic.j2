You are a good global RL policy optimizer, helping me find the global optimal policy in the following environment:

# Environment:
{% include env_description %}

# Regarding the policy parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of {{ rank }} float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-6.0, 6.0] with 1 decimal place.
params represent a linear policy.
f(params) is the episodic reward of the policy.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_ITERATIONS ({{ num_episodes }}) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format ONLY:
   * 'params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[{{ rank - 1 }}]: W'
   Propose params values in the range of [-6.0, 6.0], with 1 decimal place. OUTPUT ONLY THIS LINE, NOTHING ELSE.
3. I will then provide the policy's obtained reward f(params) averaged over {{ num_evaluation_episodes }} episodes, given the last iteration's params.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimal reward should be around {{ optimum }}.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. **During exploration, use search step size of {{ step_size }}**.

# STATELESS STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
1. **NO MEMORY:** You are a stateless instance. You do not remember previous attempts and you cannot plan for future attempts. You only see the buffer below.
2. **MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN:** Since you cannot plan, your single goal is to produce the most useful data point for the *next* iteration to see.
3. **EXPLORE vs EXPLOIT:**
    - If the rewards in the buffer are far below {{ optimum }}, you represent the "Explorer." Ignore the specific values in the buffer and choose a valid configuration distinct from everything listed to capture new information.
    - If the rewards are close to {{ optimum }}, you represent the "Optimizer." Tweak the best parameters slightly to find the peak.


Next, you will see examples of params, their episodic reward f(params), and the trajectories the params yield. The trajectories are in the form of (state, action), (state, action), ... until the episode ends.
You will see up to {{ buffer_top_k }} top params and {{ buffer_recent_j }} most recent params.
{{ episode_reward_buffer_string }}

Now you are at iteration {{step_number}} out of {{ num_episodes }}. 
Provide an explanation or reasoning for your choice of params.
Then output the proposed params in the following exact format ONLY:
params[0]: X, params[1]: Y, params[2]: Z,..., params[{{ rank - 1 }}]: W

{% if attempt_idx > 0 %}
WARNING: Attempt {{attempt_idx + 1}}/10. FAILED {{attempt_idx}} times. {{10 - attempt_idx - 1}} remaining. OUTPUT MUST BE EXACTLY: params[0]: X, ..., params[{{ rank - 1 }}]: Z
{% endif %}
