The environment is the cliff walking environment.
The cliff walking environment is a 2D 4x12 grid world (4 rows, 12 columns) where the agent can move up, right, down, or left.
The state is between 0 and 47, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 11, the second row is 12 to 23, the third row is 24 to 35, the forth row is 36 to 47. The agent always starts at the bottom left grid (3, 0) (state 36).
The environment is slippery, which means when the agent takes an action, it will go to 3 directions with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 0, it will pick from [move left, move up, move right] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 1, it will pick from [move up, move right, move down] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 2, it will pick from [move right, move down, move left] with equal probability.
- When the agent takes action 3, it will pick from [move down, move left, move up] with equal probability.
The goal is to reach the state 47 (the right bottom grid).
The policy is a function that maps the state to the action to take. The policy is represented by an array of 48 numbers. The value of params[i] represents the action to take when the state is i. The value of params[0] means which action to take when the agent is on the top left grid (0, 0). The value of params[1] means which action to take when the agent is on the top second grid (0, 1). So on and so forth.
The reward is -1 for each step. The goal is to reach the state 47 (the right bottom grid) while avoiding the cliff (the bottom row). The cliff is from state 37 to state 46. If the agent falls into the cliff, it will get a reward of -100 and then be sent to the start point. The agent should pick actions that do not have possibility of falling into the cliff.

The optimal policy would follow the following behavior: 
- When the agent is on the top row, the agent should avoid moving left.
- When the agent is on the second row, the agent should avoid moving left.
- When the agent is on the third row, the agent should avoid moving down.
- When the agent is at the starting point, the agent should avoid moving right.
- When the agent is on the most right column, the agent should avoid moving up.
