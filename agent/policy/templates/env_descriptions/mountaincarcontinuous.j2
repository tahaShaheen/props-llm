The mountain car continuous environment is a 2D world where the agent (car) is in a U shaped valley, and a torque can be applied to the car (left is negative and right is positive). 
The state is a vector of 2 elements, representing position (-1.2 to 0.6) and velocity (-0.07 to 0.07) respectively. Negative means left and positive means right for both position and velocity. The goal is to reach the flag at the far right side of the hill. 
The policy is a linear policy with 3 parameters and works as follows: 
action = position * params[0] + velocity * params[1] + params[2]
The reward is -0.1 * action^2 for each step, and 100 if the cart reaches goal. The goal is to reach the flag at the far right side of the hill.
