The mountain car environment is a 2D world where the agent (robot) is navigating in a track. The goal of this environment is to navigate the robot on a track without crashing into the walls. Initially, the robot is placed randomly into the track but at a safe distance from the walls. The state space consists of 5 range measurements. The action space consists of 3 actions (0: move_forward, 1: rotate_left, 2: rotate_right). Furthermore, both actions and states have additive white Gaussian noise. The robot is rewarded +5 for moving forward and -0.5 for rotating. If the robot crashes into the wall it is penalized with -200.  
The policy is a linear policy with 18 parameters and works as follows: 
action = argmax([sensor[0], sensor[1], sensor[2], sensor[3], sensor[4]] dot W + B)
where 
W = [[params[0], params[1]], [params[2]]
     [params[3]], [params[4], params[5]]
     [params[6]], [params[7], params[8]]
     [params[9]], [params[10], params[11]]
     [params[12]], [params[13], params[14]]
     ]
B = [params[15], params[16], params[17]]
